TI  - Influence of the Prosthetic Index Into Morse Taper Implants on Bacterial Microleakage.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of Morse taper implant index on microleakage.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty implants and abutments were divided into 3 groups (n = 10): CM1 (universal post and implant without index), CM2 (universal post and implant with index), and CM3 (abutment and implant with index). To evaluate the microleakage from the implant inner part, the implants were inoculated with Streptococcus sanguinis solution at a 0.5 McFarland and incubated for 7 days at 37 degrees C in Eppendorf tubes with sterile broth. To evaluate the microleakage into the inner part of implant, these were inoculated with sterile Schaedler broth and immersed in a Fusobacterium nucleatum solution at a 0.5 McFarland. The samples were incubated for 30 days in an anaerobic chamber. RESULTS: Nine samples of each group of the first methodology showed no presented bacterial contamination. No samples of the second methodology demonstrated turbidity of the broth. CONCLUSION: The presence of the prosthetic internal index had no influence on bacterial microleakage of Morse taper implants under static conditions, for both methodologies.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems and salivary secretion rates - A 3-year follow-up after radiation therapy to the head and neck region.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Results indicate that late improvements of radiation therapy (RT) in the head and neck region may diminish the long-term effects on salivary glands and oral microflora. The aim was therefore to analyze salivary secretion rates and oral microflora over time in RT subjects. DESIGN: Twelve dentate subjects (28+/-2 teeth) and 12 controls were included. A clinical examination was performed and the salivary secretion rates were determined. Microbial samples, analyzed using cultivation technique, were collected from the soft tissues, supragingival plaque and gingival crevice region. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the RT group (n=11) had 3 years post RT higher numbers and proportions of lactobacilli (p<0.001 and p<0.01) and Candida albicans (p<0.01 and p<0.05) in the supragingival plaque, higher numbers of enterococci in the vestibulum in the molar region and on the tongue (p<0.05 for both), a lower total count (p<0.001) and lower numbers of streptococci, Streptococcus salivarius and Fusobacterium nucleatum (p<0.01) on the tongue. Although both stimulated and unstimulated salivary secretion rates were increased over time, the proportion of microorganisms associated with oral health decreased, and microorganisms associated with oral disorders increased. Despite a comparable oral hygiene, it was only the 27% who had a stimulated salivary secretion rate >/=1.0ml/min and a buffering capacity >/=6.0, where a recovery of the flora could be seen. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that regaining a normal, stimulated salivary secretion rate and buffering capacity are prerequisites to regaining an oral flora associated with good oral health.
TI  - Peripheral blood neutrophil cytokine hyper-reactivity in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Pro-inflammatory cytokine release (IL-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) by peripheral blood neutrophils, isolated from periodontitis patients (before/after therapy) and matched controls, was determined after 18 h culture in the presence/absence of Escherichia coli LPS, opsonised Staphylococcus aureus, heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All cultures demonstrated differences in the amounts of each cytokine detected (P < 0.0001), with a clear release pattern (IL-8 > IL-6 > TNF-alpha = IL-1beta). Median cytokine release from unstimulated patient neutrophils was consistently, but non-significantly, higher than from control cells. Stimulated cytokine release from untreated patient neutrophils was also consistently higher than from control cells. This hyper-reactivity was significant for all tested cytokines when data for all stimuli were combined (P < 0.016). In terms of individual stimuli, significant hyper-reactivity was detected with LPS (IL-8), F. nucleatum (IL-8, TNF-alpha), opsonised S. aureus (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) and P. gingivalis (IL-8, IL-1beta). Cytokine production by patient neutrophils did not reduce following successful non-surgical periodontal therapy and, except for responses to F. nucleatum, the cytokine hyper-reactivity detected pre-therapy was retained. These data demonstrate that chronic periodontitis is characterised by neutrophils that constitutively exhibit cytokine hyper-reactivity, the effects of which could modulate local and systemic inflammatory-immune responses and influence the risk and severity of periodontitis-associated systemic inflammatory diseases.
TI  - Mechanistic analysis of PLGA/HPMC-based in-situ forming implants for periodontitis treatment.
AB  - In-situ forming implant formulations based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC), minocycline HCl, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and optionally hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were prepared and thoroughly characterized in vitro. This includes electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), mass change and drug release measurements under different conditions, optical microscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as well as antibacterial activity tests using gingival crevicular fluid samples from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients. Based on these results, deeper insight into the physico-chemical phenomena involved in implant formation and the control of drug release could be gained. For instance, the effects of adding HPMC to the formulations, resulting in improved implant adherence and reduced swelling, could be explained. Importantly, the in-situ formed implants effectively hindered the growth of bacteria present in the patients' periodontal pockets. Interestingly, the systems were more effectively hindering the growth of pathogenic bacterial strains (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum) than that of strains with a lower pathogenic potential (e.g., Streptococcus salivarius). In vivo, such a preferential action against the pathogenic bacteria can be expected to give a chance to the healthy flora to re-colonize the periodontal pockets.
TI  - Microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  - The development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. This in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. Biofilms consisting of Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. After 64 h, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. After 96 h, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. At the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. Apart from C. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. Biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. Extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. Biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. This in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. Within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
TI  - A case of corticosteroid-responsive Lemierre syndrome with clivus osteomyelitis and a mass in the cavernous sinus-suprasellar region.
AB  - Lemierre syndrome is a clinical syndrome that presents with internal jugular thrombophlebitis, septicemia and systemic abscess formations. In general, the condition is preceded by oropharyngeal infections. We report a case of a 73-year-old man with Lemierre syndrome, clivus osteomyelitis and a steroid-responsive mass in the cavernous sinus-suprasellar region. He complained of fever, occipital pain, diplopia and right ptosis. Administration of oral steroids ameliorated the ophthalmic symptoms for a period before he was admitted to our hospital. After admission, the severity of his headache advanced, and his ophthalmic symptoms progressed bilaterally. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed contrast enhancement of the clivus and revealed a mass lesion contrast-enhancement effect in the cavernous sinus-suprasellar region. Fusobacterium nucleatum was detected by blood culture, and computed tomography revealed multiple bacterial emboli in both lung fields and thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein; thus, he was diagnosed with Lemierre syndrome. After venous administration of antibiotics, his fever and headache markedly improved, but the ophthalmic symptoms did not. We prescribed an oral steroid because the cavernous sinus-suprasellar lesion was probably an inflammatory granuloma caused by a para-infectious mechanism rather than by infection. After the series of treatments, his ophthalmic symptoms improved, and the cavernous sinus-suprasellar region mass lesion decreased. He was eventually discharged in a fully ambulatory state and had no ophthalmic difficulties. We thought that the osteomyelitis of clivus was caused by Lemierre syndrome and its inflammatory processes formed the granuloma in the cavernous sinus-suprasellar region. This was a case of Lemierre syndrome with a rare combination of clivus osteomyelitis and a steroid-responsive tumour in the cavernous sinus-suprasellar region that was successfully treated.
TI  - Coaggregation and biofilm growth of Granulicatella spp. with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Members of fastidious Granulicatella and Aggregatibacter genera belong to normal oral flora bacteria that can cause serious infections, such as infective endocarditis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has long been implicated in aggressive periodontitis, whereas DNA-based methods only recently showed an association between Granulicatella spp. and dental diseases. As bacterial coaggregation is a key phenomenon in the development of oral and nonoral multispecies bacterial communities it would be of interest knowing coaggregation pattern of Granulicatella species with A. actinomycetemcomitans in comparison with the multipotent coaggregator Fusobacterium nucleatum. The aim was to investigate coaggregation and biofilm formation of Granulicatella elegans and Granulicatella adiacens with A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum strains. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher autoaggregation than all other test species, followed by A. actinomycetemcomitans SA269 and G. elegans. A. actinomycetemcomitans CU1060 and G. adiacens did not autoaggregate. G. elegans with F. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher coaggregation than most others, but failed to grow as biofilm together or separately. With F. nucleatum as partner, A. actinomycetemcomitans strains SA269, a rough-colony wild-type strain, and CU1060, a spontaneous smooth-colony laboratory variant, and G. adiacens were the next in coaggregation efficiency. These dual species combinations also were able to grow as biofilms. While both G. elegans and G. adiacens coaggregated with A. actinomycetemcomitans strain SA269, but not with CU1060, they grew as biofilms with both A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. CONCLUSIONS: G. elegans failed to form biofilm with F. nucleatum despite the strongest coaggregation with it. The ability of Granulicatella spp. to coaggregate and/or form biofilms with F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans strains suggests that Granulicatella spp. have the potential to integrate into dental plaque biofilms.
TI  - [Spondylodiscitis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum: new diagnostic method].
AB  - Fusobacterium spp. are Gram negative anaerobe bacteria. Vertebral osteomyelitis caused by these bacteria is very unusual; in fact, we could only find 11 cases in the literature. We report the case of a male, 46 year-old patient who had had lumbar pain for several weeks that irradiated to the right leg, and did not respond to NSAID treatment. The work-up included MRI, biopsy with draining of the collection and a universal PCR followed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The latter was used to make the microbiologic diagnosis, which identified Fusobacterium nucleatum as the causative agent. Final treatment consisted of clindamycin. In conclusion, spondylodiscitis due to Fusobacterium spp. is a rare and difficult to diagnose entity, due both to its clinical characteristics and to the difficulty in making the right microbiologic diagnosis. Vertebral biopsy and molecular microbiologic techniques such as Universal PCR rDNa, are essential to identifying the organism, making the diagnosis and prescribing appropriate antibiotic therapy.
TI  - A Clinical Study Evaluating Changes in the Microbial Flora Around Dental Implants During Various Stages of Implant Restoration.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the microbial colonization of dental implants in healthy patients before placing the implants and during the various stages of implant treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva (in completely edentulous patients) and gingival crevicular fluid samples (in partially edentulous patients) were collected from patients and analyzed to estimate the growth of microorganisms after culture. Samples were collected during 10 phases of implant placement and prosthesis insertion. Sixty dental implants, 18 of NobelReplace Select (Nobel Biocare) and 42 of GSIII/TSIII (Osstem), were evaluated. The microbial titer was estimated in colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter. The percentage distribution of the organisms during the various phases was noted and the average was compared. RESULTS: Most prevalent microorganism found was gram-positive Streptococci (3.59 x 10 CFU/mL). The titer of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Pseudomonas being 0.42 x 10 CFU/ml, 0.15 x 10 CFU/mL, 0.09 x 10 CFU/mL, and 0.03 x 10 CFU/mL, respectively. The titer of these organisms noted during the experimental phase was low. A similarity was observed in the maximum colony-forming unit per milliliter between baseline and completion of implant therapy indicating establishment of equilibrium. CONCLUSION: Regular microbial evaluation along with clinical and radiographic monitoring could help in recognizing the potential for periimplantitis and in prevention of the same.
TI  - Real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic activity is associated with the onset and progression mechanisms of oral biofilm-mediated disease; however, at present no method to monitor bacterial metabolism exists, especially for periodontopathic bacteria. Therefore, we aimed to establish a novel method for monitoring the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), as well as Streptococcus mutans (Sm) for comparison. The method is based on the dye resazurin, which is converted to the fluorescent molecule resorufin by reducing molecules derived from bacterial metabolism. Additionally, the effects of antimicrobial substances on bacterial metabolic activity were evaluated using this method. When bacterial suspensions were incubated with tryptone, glutamate, aspartate or glucose in the presence of resazurin, the fluorescence intensity increased over time by these bacterial metabolic reactions, indicating that this method can be used to monitor the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria. Chlorhexidine showed the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 15-49mug/ml for tryptone metabolism by Pg, Pi, and Fn, and 7.1-18mug/ml for glucose metabolism by Pi and Sm. The IC50s for cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate were 0.8-2.1 and 28-44mug/ml, respectively for all bacteria examined. Fluoride had no effect except the IC50 of 640mug/ml for Sm, while minocycline hydrochloride had no effect on any of the bacteria. The present study established the method for real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, and the method might be useful for evaluating the effects of antimicrobial substances on the bacterial metabolic activity.
TI  - Liquid based microbiological transport systems: conformity assessment of two commercial devices.
AB  - We compared two types of liquid-based microbiology devices for microorganism viability according to standardized quantitative elution method CLSI M40-A2. The eSwab(R) met CLSI acceptance criteria of viability maintenance for all microorganisms tested. The Sigma-Transwab(R) failed to meet CLSI acceptance criteria for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Internal jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis (lemierre syndrome) as a complication of pharyngitis.
AB  - Sore throat is a common presenting complaint in the outpatient setting. Most cases are nonbacterial in origin, but those that are bacterial are usually the result of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Guidelines exist to help physicians decide whether to treat with an antibiotic. Lemierre syndrome is a dangerous potential sequela of pharyngitis that results in septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular (IJ) vein. A high index of suspicion is needed to consider this diagnosis in the workup of pharyngitis and should be aggressively treated once identified. Consideration should be given to completing blood cultures and neck imaging because of clinical suspicion. The case study discussed here illustrates the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of Lemierre syndrome.
TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Extensive Identification of Bacterial Riboflavin Transporters and Their Distribution across Bacterial Species.
AB  - Riboflavin, the precursor for the cofactors flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, is an essential metabolite in all organisms. While the functions for de novo riboflavin biosynthesis and riboflavin import may coexist in bacteria, the extent of this co-occurrence is undetermined. The RibM, RibN, RfuABCD and the energy-coupling factor-RibU bacterial riboflavin transporters have been experimentally characterized. In addition, ImpX, RfnT and RibXY are proposed as riboflavin transporters based on positional clustering with riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (RBP) genes or conservation of the FMN riboswitch regulatory element. Here, we searched for the FMN riboswitch in bacterial genomes to identify genes encoding riboflavin transporters and assessed their distribution among bacteria. Two new putative riboflavin transporters were identified: RibZ in Clostridium and RibV in Mesoplasma florum. Trans-complementation of an Escherichia coli riboflavin auxotroph strain confirmed the riboflavin transport activity of RibZ from Clostridium difficile, RibXY from Chloroflexus aurantiacus, ImpX from Fusobacterium nucleatum and RfnT from Ochrobactrum anthropi. The analysis of the genomic distribution of all known bacterial riboflavin transporters revealed that most occur in species possessing the RBP and that some bacteria may even encode functional riboflavin transporters from two different families. Our results indicate that some species possess ancestral riboflavin transporters, while others possess transporters that appear to have evolved recently. Moreover, our data suggest that unidentified riboflavin transporters also exist. The present study doubles the number of experimentally characterized riboflavin transporters and suggests a specific, non-accessory role for these proteins in riboflavin-prototrophic bacteria.
TI  - Infections caused by Fusobacterium in children: a 14-year single-center experience.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed at reviewing our experience with infections caused by Fusobacterium in children. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical records of children admitted to Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center from 2000 to 2013, in whom Fusobacterium spp. was identified in any specimen. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (males = 12) at a mean +/- SE age of 5 +/- 1 (range 1-17) years, were identified. The most common complication was abscess formation (n = 11, 50 %). Eight children (36.4 %) had intracranial complications, including brain abscess (n = 4), meningitis (n = 4) and cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT, n = 5). Seventeen children (77 %) had bacteremia. Primary site of infection was otogenic (n = 9), oropharyngeal (n = 7), respiratory (n = 2), sinuses (n = 2), intra-abdominal (n = 1) and mucositis (n = 1). Fourteen cases were caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, including four cases with CSVT, 7/8 cases of mastoiditis, four of them with subperiosteal abscess formation; all four cases with meningitis and two brain abscesses. Fifteen (68 %) patients required surgical intervention and 3 (14 %) received anti-coagulation therapy. Excluding one patient with overwhelming sepsis with fatal outcome, all patients recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Fusobacterium infections in children can cause a diverse spectrum of disease and is associated with high rates of abscess formation and intracranial complications. Although Fusobacterium nucleatum is abundant in the oral cavity, F. necrophorum is the main pathogen that causes severe infections in healthy children.
TI  - Development of In Vitro Denture Biofilm Models for Halitosis Related Bacteria and their Application in Testing the Efficacy of Antimicrobial Agents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since dentures can serve as a reservoir for halitosis-causing oral bacteria, halitosis development is a concern for denture wearers. In this study, we surveyed the prevalence of four selected halitosis-related species (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, Veillonella atypica and Klebsiella pneumoniae) in clinical denture plaque samples, and developed denture biofilm models for these species in vitro to facilitate assessment of antimicrobial treatment efficacy. Design : Denture plaque from ten healthy and ten denture stomatitis patients was screened for the presence of aforementioned four species by PCR. Biofilm formation by these halitosis-associated species on the surfaces of denture base resin (DBR) discs was evaluated by crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The efficacy of denture cleanser treatment on these mono-species biofilms was evaluated by colony counting. Results : 80% of the subjects in the denture stomatitis group and 60% in the healthy group contained at least one of the targeted halitosis-related species in their denture plaque. All halitosis species tested were able to form biofilms on DBR disc surfaces to varying degrees. These in vitro mono-species resin biofilm models were used to evaluate the efficacy of denture cleansers, which exhibited differential efficacies. When forming biofilms on resin surfaces, the halitosis-related species displayed enhanced resistance to denture cleansers compared with their planktonic counterparts. Conclusion : The four selected halitosis-related bacterial species examined in this study are present on the majority of dentures. The mono-species biofilm models established on DBR discs for these species are an efficient screening tool for dental product evaluation.
TI  - Quantitation of biofilm and planktonic life forms of coexisting periodontal species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complexity of oral polymicrobial communities has prompted a need for  developing in vitro models to study behavior of coexisting bacteria. Little knowledge is available of in vitro co-growth of several periodontitis-associated species without early colonizers of dental plaque. THE AIM: was to determine temporal changes in the quantities of six periodontal species in an in vitro biofilm model in comparison with parallel planktonic cultures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter rectus and Fusobacterium nucleatum were anaerobically grown as multispecies and monospecies biofilms and parallel planktonic cultures using cell culture plates and microfuge tubes, respectively. After incubating 2, 4, 6, 8 days, biofilms and planktonic cultures were harvested, DNA extracted and the target species quantified using qPCR with species-specific 16S rDNA primers. Biofilm growth as monocultures was visualized at day 2 and 8 with confocal microscopy and crystal violet staining. RESULTS: The six species were found throughout the test period in all culture conditions, except that P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were not detected in multispecies planktonic cultures at day 8. In multispecies biofilm, P. gingivalis qPCR counts (cells/ml) increased (P<0.05) from day 2-8 and were then higher (P<0.05) than those of A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus, whereas in monospecies biofilm, P. gingivalis counts were lower (P<0.05) than those of the other species, except A. actinomycetemcomitans. When multi- and monospecies biofilm cultures were compared, P. gingivalis counts were higher (P<0.05) but those of the other species, except P. intermedia, lower (P<0.05) in multispecies biofilm. Comparison between planktonic and biofilm cultures showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. micra and C. rectus had higher (P<0.05) counts in planktonic cultures no matter whether grown in mono- or multispecies environment. CONCLUSIONS: Six periodontal species were able to form multispecies biofilm up to 8 days in vitro without pioneer plaque bacteria. P. gingivalis seemed to prefer multispecies biofilm environment whereas P. micra and A. actinomycetemcomitans planktonic culture.
TI  - Pyrosequencing Analysis of Subgingival Microbiota in Distinct Periodontal Conditions.
AB  - Subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  However, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed bacterial communities in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 Korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. A total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were detected. Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Synergistetes, and Spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. Although high levels of Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Fretibacterium, Rothia, Filifactor, and Treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga, Leptotrichia, and Haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. Species including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. On the other hand, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. Intriguingly, the halophile Halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. Based on Fast UniFrac analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. The current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. The influence of serum complement on NET release therefore remains unclear. We examined the DNA release induced by Staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: Actinomyces viscosus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacteria-stimulated NET release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. Various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (CR1, CD35) and 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18). RESULTS: While the presence of serum markedly enhanced NET release induced by S. aureus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by A. viscosus, there was no enhancement of NET release induced by F. nucleatum. The serum-mediated enhancement of NET release by A. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for S. aureus. Blockade of CR1, significantly reduced NET release induced by S. aureus, A. actinomycetemcomitans and A. viscosus, while blockade of CR3, had no effect. However, opsonization of S. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified IgG promoted NET release. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, complement opsonization promotes NET release induced by a variety of bacteria, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, and CR1 plays a dominant role in the process. Complement consumption or deficiency may compromise NETosis induced by some bacterial species, including A. actinomycetemcomitans. Within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against NETosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.
TI  - Microbiological profile resistant to different intracanal medications in primary  endodontic infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This clinical study aimed to determine the microbiological profile  resistant to different intracanal medications in primary endodontic infections by using both microbiological culture and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. METHODS: Twenty primarily infected root canals were selected and then instrumented before being randomly divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medications: calcium hydroxide (Ca[OH]2) or Ca(OH)2 + chlorhexidine (CHX). Samples were collected before and after root canal procedures, which consisted in submitting them to microbiological culture and processing them for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No differences were found between the Ca(OH)2 (99.98%) and Ca(OH)2 + CHX groups (99.76%) regarding the median percentage values for the reduction of cultivable bacteria. The most frequently detected species were Capnocytophaga ochracea (70%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (70%) in the initial samples. After instrumentation, the most frequently detected species were E. faecium (60%). After root canal treatments using either Ca(OH)2 or Ca(OH)2 + CHX as intracanal medications, the most frequently detected species were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (90%) and Enterococcus faecium (40%), respectively. Both treatments significantly decreased the number of bacterial species compared with the initial sample. However, this reduction was significantly greater in the Ca(OH)2 + CHX group (P < .05). This difference was also observed when evaluating the total bacterial load (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of Ca(OH)2 associated with CHX as an intracanal medication showed better results by acting on gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms although such an action to eradicate enterococci should also be sought.
TI  - Bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in Morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. In Morocco, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been strongly associated with AgP, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in Moroccan patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (ChP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised AgP compared to ChP, and Porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized AgP, when compared with generalized AgP (p = 0.040) or ChP (p = 0.016). Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. Mean proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in AgP groups, when compared to ChP, and generalized AgP patients harbored significantly higher proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, when compared to localized AgP or ChP. CONCLUSIONS: A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum were frequently detected in this Moroccan population with AgP. Differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized AgP, generalized AgP and ChP patients.
TI  - Laser supported reduction of specific microorganisms in the periodontal pocket with the aid of an Er,Cr:YSGG laser: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a radial firing tip of an Er,Cr:YSGG laser as an adjunct to a nonsurgical periodontal treatment. METHODS: Twelve patients with chronic or aggressive periodontitis were treated by conventional periodontal treatment using ultrasonic devices and hand instruments and, additionally, in two quadrants with an Er,Cr:YSGG laser. A new radial firing tip (RFPT 14-5, Biolase) was used with 1.5 W, 30 Hz, 11% air, 20% water, and pulse duration 140 mus. Microbiological smears were taken before treatment, one day after lasing, and three and six months after lasing. Pocket depths of all periodontal sites were measured before and six months after treatment. RESULTS: The total bacterial load of Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans inside the pocket was reduced significantly throughout the whole examination time. Greater pocket depth reductions were observed in all groups. There was a slight higher reduction of pocket depth in the lased group after six months. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the thesis that Er,Cr:YSGG laser supported periodontal treatment leads to a significant reduction of periopathogenes and thereby helps the maintenance of periodontal health.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native Brazilian reservation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native Brazilians living at the Umutina Indian Reservation, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. METHODS: Periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence and risk analysis was performed using Cochran and Mantel-Haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or Pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. The interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, or P. gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. Patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by Porphyromonas gulae and P. intermedia or by the association between P. gulae and T. forsythia. P. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. Gingival bleeding was associated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, T. forsythia, P. gingivalis, P. gulae, Porphyromonas endodontalis, P. intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens. Treponema denticola was uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: Peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in native Brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as T. denticola, and the presence of P. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess caused by Fusobacterium in a 21-year-old immunocompetent male.
AB  - A 21-year-old male with no significant past medical history, presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain along with fevers and chills. Lab work revealed leukocytosis, anemia, and slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase. Viral serology for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative and he was immunocompetent. Computed tomography imaging revealed hepatic abscesses, the largest measuring 9.5 cm. Empiric antibiotics were started and percutaneous drains were placed in the abscesses. Anaerobic cultures from the abscesses grew Fusobacterium nucleatum. This is a gram negative anaerobic bacteria; a normal flora of the oral cavity. Fusobacterium is most commonly seen in Lemiere's disease, which is translocation of oral bacteria to the internal jugular vein causing a thrombophlebitis and subsequent spread of abscesses. Our patient did not have Lemiere's, and is the first case described of fusobacterium pyogenic liver abscess in a young immunocompetent male with good oral hygiene. This case was complicated by sepsis, empyema, and subsequent abscesses located outside the liver. These abscesses' have the propensity to flare abruptly and can be fatal. This case not only illustrates fusobacterium as a rare entity for pyogenic liver abscess, but also the need for urgent diagnosis and treatment. It is incumbent on physicians to diagnose and drain any suspicious hepatic lesions. While uncommon, such infections may develop without any overt source and can progress rapidly. Prompt drainage with antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone of therapy.
TI  - Microbiota at teeth and implants in partially edentulous patients. A 10-year retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the microbiota at implants and adjacent teeth 10 years after placement of implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched surface. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plaque samples obtained from the deepest sites of 504 implants and of 493 adjacent teeth were analyzed for certain bacterial species associated with periodontitis, for staphylococci, for aerobic gram-negative rods, and for yeasts using nucleic acid-based methods. RESULTS: Species known to be associated with periodontitis were detectable at 6.2-78.4% of the implants. Significantly higher counts at implants in comparison with teeth were assessed for Tannerella forsythia, Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, and Campylobacter rectus. Higher counts of periodontopathogenic species were detectable at implants of current smokers than at those of non-smokers. In addition, those species were found in higher quantities at implants of subjects with periodontitis. The prevalence of Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, C. rectus, and moreover of Staphylococcus warneri might be associated with peri-implant inflammation. Selected staphylococcal species (not Staphylococcus aureus), aerobic gram-negative rods, and yeasts were frequently detected, but with the exception of S. warneri, they did not show any association with periodontal or peri-implant diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and periodontal disease are risk factors for colonization of periodontopathic bacteria at implants. Those bacterial species may play a potential role in peri-implant inflammation. The role of S. warneri needs further validation.
TI  - [Features of adhesion of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria and Candida albicans fungi to experimental samples of basis dental plastic depending on surface roughness and polishing method].
AB  - AIM: Study the main surface parameters of milled polyacrylic materials using atomic force microscopy and primary microbial adhesion of periodontopathogenic group bacteria and Candida albicans fungi taking into consideration the method of sample polishing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studied samples: mill-treated without polishing (control); ergobox polished; polished in dental laboratory conditions; polished by a rubber brush in dentists' office. Microbial strains belonging to periodontopathogenic species (clinical isolates) that had been isolated from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis, C. albicans fungi were used for modelling experiments of primary adhesion of microbes to the material samples. RESULTS: S. sanguis had the highest degree of adhesion to polymer after milling, P. gingivalis, C. albicans--medium, F. nucleatum--low. A significant reduction of adhesion is observed during polishing in dental laboratory conditions or ergobox, less significant--during polishing in dental office. CONCLUSION: The data obtained allow to make a conclusion that the samples from polymer materials for preparation of prosthesis basis have varying degree of intensity of microbial adhesion of members of periodontopathogenic microflora and C. albicans fungi that depends on the polishing method, that accordingly determined the differences in colonization resistance against formation of microbial biofilm during polymer use in clinical conditions. . ,
TI  - Prelude to oral microbes and chronic diseases: past, present and future.
AB  - Associations between oral and systemic health are ancient. Oral opportunistic bacteria, particularly, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been deviated from their traditional roles as periodontal pathogens and arguably ascended to central players based on their participations in complex co-dependent mechanisms of diverse systemic chronic diseases risk and pathogenesis, including cancers, rheumatoid-arthritis, and diabetes.
TI  - Abnormal pregnancy outcomes in mice using an induced periodontitis model and the  haematogenous migration of Fusobacterium nucleatum sub-species to the murine placenta.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate if there is subspecies specific migration to the placenta by Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and to determine whether experimentally induced periodontitis results in adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) in mice. METHODS: Periodontitis was induced in pregnant mice using an inoculum of Fn and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In parallel, four sub-species of Fn were individually injected into the circulatory system. At day 18 of gestation, the placenta, liver, spleen and blood were harvested and litter size, number of viable fetuses and resorptions, maternal, fetal and placenta weights were recorded. For the direct inoculation group, some mice were allowed to deliver for assessment of length of gestation, litter size, maternal, placental and pup weight. The presence of Fn was assessed by PCR and inflammatory mediators were measured by ELISA or multiplex analysis. RESULTS: Mice with alveolar bone loss, a marker of periodontitis, demonstrated significantly higher fetal weights (p = 0.015) and fetal/placental weight ratios (p = 0.030). PCR analysis of maternal organs did not identify Fn in any extracted tissues. In mice that received direct injection of Fn subspecies, varying degrees of APO were observed including preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal loss. Haematogenous spread of only Fn subsp. nucleatum to the placenta was confirmed. Litter size was significantly smaller (p = 0.023) and the number of resorptions was higher in inoculated versus control groups. Mice injected with subsp. nucleatum had significantly increased circulating CRP levels (p = 0.020) compared to controls while the mice with induced periodontitis had increased levels of IL-6 (p = 0.047) and IL-8 (p = 0.105). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis in mice elevated fetal weight and the fetal weight/placental weight ratio. This study found that subsp. nucleatum migrated haematogenously to the placenta, leading to APO in mice. The study supports the potential role of Fn in the association between periodontitis and APO.
TI  - Short-chain Fatty Acids in Infected Root Canals of Teeth with Apical Periodontitis before and after Treatment.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are bacterial metabolic end products that may function as virulence factors. This study evaluated the occurrence of SCFAs in infected root canals before and after treatment. METHODS: Samples were taken from root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis before (S1) and after (S2) chemomechanical preparation with either NaOCl or chlorhexidine as the irrigant and then after interappointment medication with calcium hydroxide (S3). High-performance liquid chromatography was used for detection of SCFAs. Selected bacterial taxa that are recognized producers of the target SCFAs were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Butyric acid was the most common fatty acid in S1, followed by propionic acid. Both molecules were also found in S2 and S3 from both NaOCl and chlorhexidine groups. Lactic acid was not present in detectable levels in S1, but it occurred in 1 postinstrumentation sample and in 9 samples taken after calcium hydroxide medication. Of the target taxa, Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent in S1 (76%), followed by members of the Actinobacteria phylum (71%), Streptococcus species (59%), and Parvimonas micra (53%). Gram-positive taxa, especially streptococci, were the most prevalent bacteria in S2 and S3. SCFA detection was matched with the respective potential producer species in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of SCFAs in infected root canals suggests that these molecules may play a role in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. Significance of persistence of SCFAs after treatment and its effects on the long-term outcome await elucidation.
TI  - The effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  - We have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella melaninogenica. In the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four Fusobacteria species (Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, F. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. We also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. Cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm with power density of 80 mW/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 J/cm2. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. Suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light at 455 nm with power density of 50 mW/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 J/cm2. Microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mW/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 J/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. Bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. The selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard DNA-DNA format. In cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). HPLC demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in bacteria. Following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). DNA probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. The cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. This may introduce a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial photodynamic treatment of periodontopathogenic bacteria with indocyanine green and near-infrared laser light enhanced by Trolox(TM).
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been shown that certain vitamins can significantly enhance the effect of photodynamic anti-tumor therapy. Unfortunately, there is no sufficient information available about the impact of those antioxidants on antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT). The present study is aimed at investigating the antimicrobial effect of the dye indocyanine green (ICG) in the presence of Trolox(TM) , a vitamin E analogue, upon irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) laser light (808 nm) on the gramnegative periodontopathogenic bacteria Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.). METHODS: Bacteria solved in PBS were incubated with ICG (50-500 mug/ml) in the presence and absence of Trolox(TM) (2 mM). Irradiation was performed after 10 minutes of dark-incubation with NIR-laser-light (25-100 J/cm(2) , 810 nm). During treatment, temperature was also recorded inside the bacterial solutions. The treated suspensions were serial diluted and plated onto blood agar plates. After anaerobe cultivation for 5 days the colony-forming units (CFU/ml) were determined. RESULTS: The antibacterial effect was ICG-concentration and exposure dependent. It was found that high ICG-concentrations and light fluence rates caused bacterial reduction due to hyperthermia. Where low ICG-concentrations (<250 mug/ml) and fluence rates only induced minor regression, additional Trolox(TM) -administration significantly enhanced the photodynamic effect. While treatment of A.a. (250 mug/ml ICG, 100 J/cm(2) ) without Trolox(TM) caused no bacterial reduction, additional administration led to total eradication. In the presence of Trolox(TM) reduction to one-fifth of the original ICG-concentration (50 mug/ml) still induced total suppression of P.g. and F.n. at identical fluence (100 J/cm(2) ). Treatment with ICG, NIR-light or Trolox(TM) alone showed no remarkable bactericidal effect. Application of high ICG-concentrations (500 mug/ml) and exposure values (100 J/cm(2) ) caused peak temperatures of 64.53 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly show that Trolox(TM) significantly enhanced the antibacterial effect of ICG upon irradiation with NIR-laser-light. Additional administration of Trolox(TM) may also increase the efficiency of other aPDT systems. in vivo. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:???-???, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
TI  - Subacute osteomyelitis of the femur due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in a 7-year-old boy.
AB  - Subacute hematogenous osteomyelitis is an insidious infection, which commonly has a delayed diagnosis. We describe the case of a 7-year-old boy with subacute osteomyelitis, which was initially considered to be a bone tumor. Infection should be considered in all cases of bone pain, especially in children, even in the absence of typical systemic features of inflammation.
TI  - DNA methylation differentially regulates cytokine secretion in gingival epithelia in response to bacterial challenges.
AB  - Epigenetic modifications are changes in gene expression without altering DNA sequence. We previously reported that bacteria-specific innate immune responses are regulated by epigenetic modifications. Our hypothesis is that DNA methylation affects gingival cytokine secretion in response to bacterial stimulation. Gingival epithelial cells (GECs) were treated with DNMT-1 inhibitors prior to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) or Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) exposure. Protein secretion was assessed using ELISA. Gene expression was quantified using qRT-PCR. The ability of bacteria to invade inhibitor pretreated GECs was assessed utilizing flow cytometry. Changes were compared to unstimulated GECs. GEC upregulation of IL-6 and CXCL1 by Pg or Fn stimulation was significantly diminished by inhibitor pretreatment. Pg stimulated IL-1alpha secretion and inhibitor pretreatment significantly enhanced this upregulation, while Fn alone or with inhibitor pretreatment had no effect on IL-1alpha expression. GEC upregulation of human beta-definsin-2 in response to Pg and Fn exposure was enhanced following the inhibitor pretreatment. GEC susceptibility to bacterial invasion was unaltered. These results suggest that DNA methylation differentially affects gingival cytokine secretion in response to Pg or Fn. Our data provide basis for better understanding of how epigenetic modifications, brought on by exposure to oral bacteria, will subsequently affect host susceptibility to oral diseases.
TI  - Oral bacteria adherence to suture threads: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the adherence of oral microorganisms to different types of suture threads. METHODS: Pieces of thread were distributed on 24-well plates, according to the following groups: (G1) nylon, (G2) silk, (G3) polyglactin 910, (G4) polyglactin 910 with triclosan. Blank control (G5) consisted of one thread from each group. Adherence to thread tests was performed to observe adhesion of total microorganisms from saliva or two isolates of Prevotella intermedia (ATCC49046) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC51190). Brain-heart infusion (BHI) medium with or without bacterial inoculum (1.8 x 107 CFU/mL) was added to each well of microplates. The microplates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees C, for 5 days for biofilm formation. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups as regard to adhesion of F. nucleatum (p > 0.05). For P. intermedia, the threads in G1 and G4 showed a lower level of adhesion (p < 0.05), with no difference between them. Against total microorganisms, G1 presented a lower level of adherence (p < 0.05), followed by G4; and no difference was observed between G2 and G3. CONCLUSIONS: Total microorganisms and P. intermedia have different affinities to the tested suture threads, whereas F. nucleatum presented a similar adherence level. Among the threads, nylon (G1), followed by polyglactin 910 with triclosan (G4) presented the lowest microbial adherence level.
TI  - High in vitro antibacterial activity of Pac-525 against Porphyromonas gingivalis  biofilms cultured on titanium.
AB  - In order to investigate the potential of short antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as alternative antibacterial agents during the treatment of peri-implantitis, the cytotoxic activity of three short AMPs, that is, Pac-525, KSL-W, and KSL, was determined using the MTT assay. The antimicrobial activity of these AMPs, ranging in concentration from 0.0039 mg/mL to 0.5 mg/mL, against the predominant planktonic pathogens, including Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, involved in peri-implantitis was investigated. Furthermore, 2-day-old P. gingivalis biofilms cultured on titanium surfaces were treated with Pac-525 and subsequently observed and analysed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The average cell proliferation curve indicated that there was no cytotoxicity due to the three short AMPs. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values of Pac-525 were 0.0625 mg/mL and 0.125 mg/mL, respectively, for P. gingivalis and 0.0078 mg/mL and 0.0156 mg/mL, respectively, for F. nucleatum. Using CLSM, we confirmed that compared to 0.1% chlorhexidine, 0.5 mg/mL of Pac-525 caused a significant decrease in biofilm thickness and a decline in the percentage of live bacteria. These data indicate that Pac-525 has unique properties that might make it suitable for the inhibition the growth of pathogenic bacteria around dental implants.
TI  - Killing dental pathogens using antibacterial graphene oxide.
AB  - Dental caries and periodontal diseases have a close relationship with microbes such as Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Graphene oxide (GO), as the derivative of graphene, plays an important role in many areas including biology and medicine. In particular, it has been known as a promising antimicrobial nanomaterial. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial property of GO against dental pathogens. With the utilization of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduced test, colony forming units (CFU) counting, growth curve observation, live/dead fluorescent staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we found GO nanosheets were highly effective in inhibiting the growth of dental pathogens. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the cell wall and membrane of bacteria lost their integrity and the intracellular contents leaked out after they were treated by GO. Therefore, GO nanosheets would be an effective antibacterial material against dental pathogens and the potential applications in dental care and therapy are promising.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of visible light in the presence of erythrosine on Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum compared with diode laser, an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been introduced as a new modality in oral bacterial decontamination. Besides, the ability of laser irradiation in the presence of photosensitizing agent to lethal effect on oral bacteria is well documented. Current research aims to evaluate the effect of photodynamic killing of visible blue light in the presence of plaque disclosing agent erythrosine as photosensitizer on Porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal bone loss and Fusobacterium nucleatum associated with soft tissue inflammation, comparing with the near-infrared diode laser. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard suspension of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were exposed to Light Emitting Diode (LED) (440-480 nm) used to photopolymerize composite resine dental restoration in combination with erythrosine (22 microm) up to 5 minutes. Bacterial sample were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. Bacterial samples from each treatment groups (radiation-only group, erythrosine-only group and light or laser with erythrosine group) were subcultured onto the surface of agar plates. Survival of these bacteria was determined by counting the number of colony forming units (CFU) after incubation. RESULTS: Exposure to visible blue light and diode laser in conjugation with erythrosine significantly reduced both species examined viability, whereas erythrosine-treated samples exposed to visible light suggested a statically meaningful differences comparing to diode laser. In addition, bactericidal effect of visible light or diode laser alone on P. gingivalis as black-pigmented bacteria possess endogenous porphyrins was noticeably. CONCLUSION: Our result suggested that visible blue light source in the presence of plaque disclosing agent erythrosine could can be consider as potential approach of PDT to kill the main gram-negative periodontal pathogens. From a clinical standpoint, this regimen could be established as an additional minimally invasive antibacterial treatment of plaque induced periodontal pathologies.
TI  - Association of Fusobacterium nucleatum with clinical and molecular features in colorectal serrated pathway.
AB  - Human gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as a player in colorectal cancers (CRCs). Evidence suggests that Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) may contribute to disease progression and is associated with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in CRCs; however, to date, there are no reports about the relationship between F. nucleatum and molecular features in the early stage of colorectal tumorigenesis. Therefore, we investigated the presence of F. nucleatum in premalignant colorectal lesions. In total, 465 premalignant lesions (343 serrated lesions and 122 non-serrated adenomas) and 511 CRCs were studied. We determined the presence of F. nucleatum and analyzed its association with molecular features including CIMP, MSI and microRNA-31 status. F. nucleatum was detected in 24% of hyperplastic polyps, 35% of sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), 30% of traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) and 33% of non-serrated adenomas. F. nucleatum was more frequently detected in CIMP-high premalignant lesions than in CIMP-low/zero lesions (p = 0.0023). In SSAs, F. nucleatum positivity increased gradually from sigmoid colon to cecum (p = 0.042). F. nucleatum positivity was significantly higher in CRCs (56%) than in premalignant lesions of any histological type (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, F. nucleatum was identified in premalignant colorectal lesions regardless of histopathology but was more frequently associated with CIMP-high lesions. Moreover, F. nucleatum positivity increased according to histological grade, suggesting that it may contribute to the progression of colorectal neoplasia. Our data also indicate that F. nucleatum positivity in SSAs may support the "colorectal continuum" concept.
TI  - An oral commensal associates with disease: chicken, egg, or red herring?
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum might be the cause or consequence of disease in many tissues in and outside the mouth. In this issue of Immunity, Gur et al. (2015) suggest a new mechanism by which this oral commensal might help cancer cells escape host immunity.
TI  - Binding of the Fap2 protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum to human inhibitory receptor TIGIT protects tumors from immune cell attack.
AB  - Bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, are present in the tumor microenvironment. However, the immunological consequences of intra-tumoral bacteria remain unclear. Here, we have shown that natural killer (NK) cell killing of various tumors is inhibited in the presence of various F. nucleatum strains. Our data support that this F. nucleatum-mediated inhibition is mediated by human, but not by mouse TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor present on all human NK cells and on various T cells. Using a library of F. nucleatum mutants, we found that the Fap2 protein of F. nucleatum directly interacted with TIGIT, leading to the inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity. We have further demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed TIGIT and that T cell activities were also inhibited by F. nucleatum via Fap2. Our results identify a bacterium-dependent, tumor-immune evasion mechanism in which tumors exploit the Fap2 protein of F. nucleatum to inhibit immune cell activity via TIGIT.
TI  - Evaluation of holy basil mouthwash as an adjunctive plaque control agent in a four day plaque regrowth model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Various antibacterial and antiplaque agents are used in chemical plaque control but none are without their shortcomings. Chlorhexidine considered a gold standard, also has an array of side effects. To overcome these, numerous herbal extracts have been tried and tested and one among them is holy basil. The present study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of holy basil in vitro against some periodontopathogens and its antiplaque effect in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty periodontally healthy volunteers were randomly divided into three groups and refrained from all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days and used one of the randomly assigned mouthwash (1- chlorhexidine; 2- holy basil; and 3- sterile water [placebo]) twice daily. The Plaque Index (PI) was assessed at days 0 and 5. Aqueous extract of holy basil was tested against Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum). RESULTS: Holy basil extract showed inhibition of both the tested periodontopathogens (P.intermedia and F.nucleatum) at various concentrations. In all groups, the PI increased from baseline to day 5. There was a statistically significant difference (p < .05) between the chlorhexidine and placebo rinse and the holy basil and placebo rinse, but no statistically significant difference was found between the chlorhexidine and holy basil rinse with respect to PI. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the holy basil mouthwash has an antiplaque effect and is efficacious against P. intermedia and F. nucleatum strains in vitro. Hence holy basil mouthwash may have potential as an antiplaque mouthwash with prophylactic benefits. Key words:Antibacterial agent, basil, Fusobacterium nucleatum, mouthwashes, Prevotella intermedia.
TI  - [Cerebellar abscess due to infection with the anaerobic bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum: a case report].
AB  - We report a rare case of cerebellar abscess produced by anaerobic bacteria. A 76-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a history of fever, vomiting, and dizziness lasting 14 days. Computed tomography(CT)scan and magnetic resonance images showed the presence of a multiloculated cerebellar abscess with a right subdural abscess. The patient underwent aspiration of the abscess through a suboccipital craniotomy. Fusobacterium nucleatum, which is an anaerobic bacteria naturally present in the human oral cavity, was detected in cultures of the aspirated abscess. The patient was administered antibiotic treatment combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy(HBO). The symptoms were briefly relieved but the cerebellar abscess recurred, which required a second aspiration. The combined treatment with antibiotics and HBO was maintained after the second operation. After 6 weeks of treatment, the cerebellar abscess was completely controlled. We conclude that antibiotic treatment combined with HBO is useful for treatment of cerebellar abscesses caused by infection with anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - High individuality of respiratory bacterial communities in a large cohort of adult cystic fibrosis patients under continuous antibiotic treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine clinical diagnostics of CF patients focus only on a restricted set of well-known pathogenic species. Recent molecular studies suggest that infections could be polymicrobial with many bacteria not detected by culture-based diagnostics. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A large cohort of 56 adults with continuous antibiotic treatment was studied and different microbial diagnostic methods were compared, including culture-independent and culture-based bacterial diagnostics. A total of 72 sputum samples including longitudinal observations was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison. Prevalence of known pathogens was highly similar among all methods but the vast spectrum of bacteria associated with CF was only revealed by culture-independent techniques. The sequence comparison enabled confident determination of the bacterial community composition and revealed a high diversity and individuality in the communities across the cohort. Results of microbiological analyses were further compared with individual host factors, such as age, lung function and CFTR genotype. No statistical relationship between these factors and the diversity of the entire community or single bacterial species could be identified. However, patients with non-DeltaF508 mutations in the CFTR gene often had low abundances of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Persistence of specific bacteria in some communities was demonstrated by longitudinal analyses of 13 patients indicating a potential clinical relevance of anaerobic bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus millerii. CONCLUSIONS: The high individuality in community composition and the lack of correlation to clinical host factors might be due to the continuous treatment with antibiotics. Since this is current practice for adult CF patients, the life-long history of the patient and the varying selection pressure on the related microbial communities should be a focus of future studies and its relation to disease progression. These studies should be substantially larger, providing more molecular information on the microbial communities complemented by detailed genetic assessment of the host.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. METHODS In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. Furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against S. mutans was performed. RESULTS: The results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various oral bacteria and fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . mL(-1) to 125 mug . mL(-1), and the MIC of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . mL(-1) to 1,000 mug . mL(-1). Among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic S. mutans. Results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of S. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed S. mutans after 30 min. No viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: This study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.
TI  - Changes in microflora in dental plaque from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and the relationship of these changes with mucositis: A pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess changes in oral microflora in dental plaque from cancer patients within 7 days of the first course of chemotherapy, and the relationship of the changes with mucositis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty cancer patients, divided into a test group undergoing chemotherapy and a control group no undergoing chemotherapy, were enrolled in this pilot study. Oral microflora were cultured from three samples of dental plaque at t0 (before chemotherapy), t1 (1 day after chemotherapy) and t2 (7 days after chemotherapy). Single and crossed descriptive analyses were used to establish prevalence, and the chi2 test was used to establish the statistical significance of the differences observed in distributions (significance level: P<0.05). RESULTS: In most patients (57%), oral microflora consisted mainly of Gram-positive cocci, while the remaining 43% of the bacterial flora also had periodontal-pathogenic species. No Porphyromonas gingivalis appeared in the test group. Actinobacillus was the least frequently found bacterium among periodontal pathogens in the test group, while Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most frequently found. No significant differences were found in quantitative bacterial changes between t0, t1 and t2 in either the test or control groups, or between the two groups. According to World Health Organization scores, oral mucositis developed in 10 patients (66.6%) in the test group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study indicate that there were no changes in microflora in dental plaque in cancer patients within 7 days of the first course of chemotherapy. No correlations between oral mucositis and specific microorganisms were assessed.
TI  - Recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: Twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. Curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using PCR to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. The chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. A repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. RESULTS: The effect of probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. Likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. Overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. The microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. Further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. CONCLUSION: There is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.
TI  - Novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of periodontitis by curcumin.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of locally delivered 1% curcumin gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 25 patients, belonging to both sex, aged between 21-45 years. All patients diagnosed as chronic periodontitis with periodontal pockets of depth >5mm bilaterally were randomly selected. A split mouth design was followed and the patients received a complete prophylaxis including scaling and root planing. Examination of plaque index, bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level were measured for each patient. The test group received 1% curcumin gel along with scaling and root planing whereas the control group received scaling and root planing alone followed by microbiological samples taken at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months interval. RESULTS: The 1% curcumin gel appeared to provide significant improvements in clinical parameters. Microbiological counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga showed significant reduction in periopathogens at the test sites after six months when compared with that of control sites. CONCLUSION: Locally delivered 1% curcumin gel was more effective in inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria when used as an adjunct to SRP in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - We explored the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies. MALDI-TOF MS spectra of five F. nucleatum subspecies (animalis, fusiforme, nucleatum, polymorphum, and vincentii) were analyzed and divided into four distinct clusters, including subsp. animalis, nucleatum, polymorphum, and fusiforme/vincentii. MALDI-TOF MS with the modified SARAMIS database further correctly identified 28 of 34 F. nucleatum clinical isolates to the subspecies level.
TI  - Isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. The aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (S1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (S2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (S3). METHODS: Bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root canals. Samples were inoculated into culture media at a pH of 9 and incubated anaerobically. The identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. RESULTS: All S1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a pH of 9. Gram-positive bacteria Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus and Streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. Of 13 culture-positive S2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a pH of 9, namely Streptococcus sanguinis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Streptococcus oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at S1. All 3 culture-positive S3 samples tolerated a pH of 9, namely S. sanguinis and E. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding S1 and S2 samples. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the presence of alkaline-tolerant Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.
TI  - 16S rRNA based microarray analysis of ten periodontal bacteria in patients with different forms of periodontitis.
AB  - DNA microarray analysis is a computer based technology, that a reverse capture, which targets 10 periodontal bacteria (ParoCheck) is available for rapid semi-quantitative determination. The aim of this three-year retrospective study was to display the microarray analysis results for the subgingival biofilm samples taken from patient cases diagnosed with different forms of periodontitis. A total of 84 patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP,n:29), generalized chronic periodontitis (GCP, n:25), peri-implantitis (PI,n:14), localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP,n:8) and refractory chronic periodontitis (RP,n:8) were consecutively selected from the archives of the Oral Microbiological Diagnostic Laboratory. The subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed by the microarray-based identification of 10 selected species. All the tested species were detected in the samples. The red complex bacteria were the most prevalent with very high levels in all groups. Fusobacterium nucleatum was detected in all samples at high levels. The green and blue complex bacteria were less prevalent compared with red and orange complex, except Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitas was detected in all LAP group. Positive correlations were found within all the red complex bacteria and between red and orange complex bacteria especially in GCP and GAP groups. Parocheck enables to monitoring of periodontal pathogens in all forms of periodontal disease and can be alternative to other guiding and reliable microbiologic tests.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory, Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Effects of Artemisinin Extracts  from Artemisia annua L.
AB  - The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of artemisinin derived from water, methanol, ethanol, or acetone extracts of Artemisia annua L. were evaluated. All 4 artemisinin-containing extracts had anti-inflammatory effects. Of these, the acetone extract had the greatest inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1beta , IL-6, and IL-10) production. Antioxidant activity evaluations revealed that the ethanol extract had the highest free radical scavenging activity, (91.0+/-3.2%), similar to alpha-tocopherol (99.9%). The extracts had antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathic microorganisms Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. animalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, and Prevotella intermedia. This study shows that Artemisia annua L. extracts contain anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial substances and should be considered for use in pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dental diseases.
TI  - Identification of an outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum that binds with high affinity to bovine endothelial cells.
AB  - Fusobacterium necrophorum, a Gram-negative anaerobe, is the primary etiologic agent of liver abscesses in cattle. There are two subspecies; subsp. necrophorum and subsp. funduliforme, which differ in morphological, biochemical, molecular characteristics, and virulence. The subsp. necrophorum, which is more virulent, occurs more frequently in liver abscesses than the subsp. funduliforme. Bacterial adhesion to the host cell surface is critical to the pathogenesis of several bacterial infections, and in F. necrophorum, outer membrane proteins (OMP) have been shown to mediate adhesion to bovine endothelial cells. The objective of this study was to identify potential adhesins that are involved in adhesion of F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum to the host cells. An OMP of 42.4 kDa, which binds with high affinity to the bovine endothelial cells and is recognized by the sera from cattle with liver abscesses, was identified. N-terminal sequencing of the protein showed 96% homology to the FomA protein of F. nucleatum. The PCR analysis showed that this fomA gene was present in several strains of subsp. necrophorum, subsp. funduliforme of bovine and subsp. funduliforme of human origin. The purified native and recombinantly expressed protein when preincubated with the endothelial cells, prevented the attachment of subsp. necrophorum significantly. In addition, the polyclonal antibody produced against the protein prevented the binding of subsp. necrophorum to bovine endothelial cells.
TI  - Association between periodontal condition and subgingival microbiota in women during pregnancy: a longitudinal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, the gingival conditions and the quantitative detection  for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia in pregnant women were determined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Quantitative determinations of periodontal bacteria by using a SyBr green system in women during pregnancy were performed. Women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and non-pregnant women were included in this study. A. actinomycetemcomitans was observed in high numbers in women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy with a significant difference (p<0.05). F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were also observed in high levels. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our results show that pregnant women are more susceptible to gingivitis, and the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival biofilm might be taken into account for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  - Selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  - Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (Poly)phenols (PPs), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. The objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of selected PPs on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. Selected PPs (n = 48) were screened against Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). The antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (PMIC) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (PMBC) using standardized broth microdilution assays. The most active PPs were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. Of the 48 PPs tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (PMIC range = 7.8-62.5 mug mL(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (PMIC range = 2.4-2500 mug mL(-1)), pyrocatechol (MIC range = 4.9-312.5 mug mL(-1)) and quercetin (PMIC range = 31.2-500 mug mL(-1)). At this concentration, adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of S. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. While both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. Overall, PPs possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. Further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Fusobacterium and Escherichia: models of colorectal cancer driven by microbiota and the utility of microbiota in colorectal cancer screening.
AB  - Intestinal microbiota has emerging roles in the development of colorectal cancer  (CRC). Intestinal dysbiosis, with altered levels of specific bacteria, is consistently seen in CRC. The heart of the debate lies in whether these bacteria are a cause or consequence of CRC. Two bacteria in particular, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli, have consistently been associated with CRC. This review will examine evidence supporting oncogenic roles of F. nucleatum and E. coli. The proposed mechanisms of tumor formation follow two models: bacterial induced chronic inflammation leads to cell proliferation and tumor formation and virulence factors directly induce tumor formation. This review will further examine the potential for microbiota as biomarkers in CRC, with a focus on F. nucleatum.
TI  - Microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  - Nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. Twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. All the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (Control). All the interventions had a duration of 30 days. The DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. The supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). The total genome counts from the Control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). After 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Other major periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels. The toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum: a commensal-turned pathogen.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic oral commensal and a periodontal pathogen associated with a wide spectrum of human diseases. This article reviews its implication in adverse pregnancy outcomes (chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis, preeclampsia), GI disorders (colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis), cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, respiratory tract infections, Lemierre's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. The virulence mechanisms involved in the diseases are discussed, with emphasis on its colonization, systemic dissemination, and induction of host inflammatory and tumorigenic responses. The FadA adhesin/invasin conserved in F. nucleatum is a key virulence factor and a potential diagnostic marker for F. nucleatum-associated diseases.
TI  - One-step purification and porin transport activity of the major outer membrane proteins P2 from Haemophilus influenzae, FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum and PorB from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - Bacterial porins are major outer membrane proteins that function as essential solute transporters between the bacteria and the extracellular environment. Structural features of porins are also recognized by eukaryotic cell receptors involved in innate and adaptive immunity. To better investigate the function of porins, proper refolding is necessary following purification from inclusion bodies [1, 2]. Using a single-step size exclusion chromatographic method, we have purified three major porins from pathogenic bacteria, the OmpP2 (P2) from Haemophilus influenzae, FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum and PorB from Neisseria meningitidis, at high yield and report their unique solute transport activity with size exclusion limit. Furthermore, we have optimized their purification method and achieved improvement of their thermostability for facilitating functional and structural analyses.
TI  - Primate pulpal healing after exposure and TheraCal application.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this in vivo study was to compare the effectiveness of a new  light cured resin based dicalcium/tricalcium silicate pulp capping material (TheraCalLC, Bisco), pure Portland cement, resin based calcium hydroxide or glass ionomer in the healing of bacterially contaminated primate pulps. STUDY DESIGN: The experiment required four primates each having 12 teeth prepared with buccal penetrations into the pulpal tissues with an exposure of approximately 1.0 mm. The exposed pulps of the primate teeth were covered with cotton pellets soaked in a bacterial mixture consisting of microorganisms normally found in human pulpal abscesses. After removal of the pellet, hemostasis was obtained and the pulp capping agents applied. The light cured resin based pulp capping material (TheraCal LC) was applied to the pulpal tissue of twelve teeth with a needle tip syringe and light cured for 15 seconds. Pure Portland cement mixed with a 2% Chlorhexidine solution was placed on the exposed pulpal tissues of another twelve teeth. Twelve additional teeth had a base of GIC applied (Triage, Fuji VII GC America) and another twelve had a pulp cap with VLC DYCAL (Dentsply), a light cured calcium hydroxide resin based material. The pulp capping bases were then covered with a RMGI (Fuji II LC GC America). The tissue samples were collected at 4 weeks. The samples were deminerilized, sectioned, stained and histologically graded. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in regard to pulpal inflammation (H = 0.679, P = 1.00). However, both the Portland cement and light cured TheraCal LC groups had significantly more frequent hard tissue bridge formation at 28 days than the GIC and VLC Dycal groups (H = 11.989, P = 0.009). The measured thickness of the hard tissue bridges with the pure Portland and light cured TheraCal LC groups were statistically greater than that of the other two groups (H = 15.849, P = 0.002). In addition, the occurrence of pulpal necrosis was greater with the GIC group than the others. Four premolars, one each treated according to the protocols were analyzed with a microCT machine. The premolar treated with the light cured TheraCal LC demonstrated a complete hard tissue bridge. The premolar treated with the GIC did not show a complete hard tissue bridge while the premolar treated with VLC Dycal had an incomplete bridge. The pure Portland with Chlorhexidine mixture created extensive hard tissue bridging. CONCLUSION: TheraCal LC applied to primate pulps created dentin bridges and mild inflammation acceptable for pulp capping.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum: an emerging bug in colorectal tumorigenesis.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is a plethora of diverse microbial species, wherein certain bacteria considered as driver bacteria with procarcinogenic features contribute directly toward colonic epithelium cell damage to initiate colorectal carcinogenesis. However, some bacteria, in particular Fusobacterium nucleatum, which is otherwise a normal resident of the oral microflora and a relatively poor colonizer of the healthy gut, have also been considered to play a role in the development of colorectal cancer. Many studies have reported that F. nucleatum is associated with colorectal adenomas and advanced-stage colorectal cancer, but its precise role in the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here, we review some of the important features of F. nucleatum, its association with inflammatory bowel disease, modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment, and E-cadherin/beta-catenin signaling.
TI  - Effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (PT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: The study was conducted from December 2013 to May 2014 at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups in a 1:1 ratio: SRP+PT and SRP (control) groups. All participants underwent full-mouth SRP. PT was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. RESULTS: The clinical parameters improved in both the groups. At the follow-up assessment, PPD was significantly decreased in the SRP+PT group (P=0.00). Further, PPD and CAL showed significantly greater changes in the SRP+PT group than in the SRP group (PPD, P=0.03; CAL, P=0.04). P. gingivalis and T. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive PT seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial effects is not sufficient. Long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective PT protocol and compare the effectiveness of PT with and without exogenous photosensitizers.
TI  - N-acetylcysteine and the human serum components that inhibit bacterial invasion of gingival epithelial cells prevent experimental periodontitis in mice.
AB  - PURPOSE: We previously reported that human serum significantly reduces the invasion of various oral bacterial species into gingival epithelial cells in vitro. The aims of the present study were to characterize the serum component(s) responsible for the inhibition of bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and to examine their effect on periodontitis induced in mice. METHODS: Immortalized human gingival epithelial (HOK-16B) cells were infected with various 5- (and 6-) carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-labeled oral bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Provetella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponiema denticola, in the absence or presence of three major serum components (human serum albumin [HSA], pooled human IgG [phIgG] and alpha1-antitrypsin). Bacterial adhesion and invasion were determined by flow cytometry. The levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of small GTPases were examined. Experimental periodontitis was induced by oral inoculation of P. gingivalis and T. denticola in Balb/c mice. RESULTS: HSA and phIgG, but not alpha1-antitrypsin, efficiently inhibited the invasion of various oral bacterial species into HOK-16B cells. HSA but not phIgG decreased the adhesion of F. nucleatum onto host cells and the levels of intracellular ROS in HOK-16B cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, decreased both the levels of intracellular ROS and invasion of F. nucleatum into HOK-16B cells, confirming the role of ROS in bacterial invasion. Infection with F. nucleatum activated Rac1, a regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Not only HSA and NAC but also phIgG decreased the F. nucleatum-induced activation of Rac1. Furthermore, both HSA plus phIgG and NAC significantly reduced the alveolar bone loss in the experimental periodontitis induced by P. gingivalis and T. denticola in mice. CONCLUSIONS: NAC and the serum components HSA and phIgG, which inhibit bacterial invasion of oral epithelial cells in vitro, can successfully prevent experimental periodontitis.
TI  - Fap2 of Fusobacterium nucleatum is a galactose-inhibitable adhesin involved in coaggregation, cell adhesion, and preterm birth.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral anaerobe involved in periodontitis that  is known to translocate and cause intrauterine infections. In the oral environment, F. nucleatum adheres to a large diversity of species, facilitating their colonization and creating biological bridges that stabilize the multispecies dental biofilm. Many of these interactions (called coadherences or coaggregations) are galactose sensitive. Galactose-sensitive interactions are also involved in the binding of F. nucleatum to host cells. Hemagglutination of some F. nucleatum strains is also galactose sensitive, suggesting that a single galactose-sensitive adhesin might mediate the interaction of fusobacteria with many partners and targets. In order to identify the fusobacterial galactose-sensitive adhesin, a system for transposon mutagenesis in fusobacteria was created. The mutant library was screened for hemagglutination deficiency, and three clones were isolated. All three clones were found to harbor the transposon in the gene coding for the Fap2 outer membrane autotransporter. The three fap2 mutants failed to show galactose-inhibitable coaggregation with Porphyromonas gingivalis and were defective in cell binding. A fap2 mutant also showed a 2-log reduction in murine placental colonization compared to that of the wild type. Our results suggest that Fap2 is a galactose-sensitive hemagglutinin and adhesin that is likely to play a role in the virulence of fusobacteria.
TI  - Microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. From Sept 2011 to July 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - MP (conventional) and ME (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. Patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - MP (conventional) and ME (mountless) - were recruited. Samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (CIAS) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qRT-PCR was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Peptostreptococcus micros (Pm), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Eikenella corrodens (Ec), and Candida albicans (Ca). The ANOVA test was used to test for differences. Nine patients (20 implants, MP group) and 5 patients (10 implants, ME group) were included. Regarding the red complex, Tf was seen in 80% and 30% of MP and ME implants respectively (p<0.001). Significant differences were also found in microbial load. For Td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. Regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in MP implants, although differences were non-significant. Microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for MP than ME, being these differences statistically significant for Fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). Finally, Ec was only detected in the MP group, and Ca and Aa were not found in either group. Within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aA mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.
TI  - Myopericarditis associated with Fusobacterium nucleatum-caused liver abscess.
AB  - A wide clinical spectrum of bacteremic disease caused by Fusobacterium has been presented in this journal. We wish to extend this spectrum by presenting a case of myopericarditis resulting from a liver abscess caused by F. nucleatum. While F. nucleatum plays an important role in periodontal disease, and has been isolated from skin ulcers, liver abscesses, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis, a single case of F. nucleatum-induced pericarditis is documented in the literature.
TI  - Distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of Chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of Chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (AgP) is available. The aim of the present study was to investigate the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. DESIGN: Saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 AgP probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). Eight periodontal microorganisms, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, the distribution of fimA genotypes was assessed in P. gingivalis-positive individuals by PCR. RESULTS: P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, C. rectus and F. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in AgP probands and in their relatives. Kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans (Kappa = 0.503) and F. nucleatum (Kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. Most probands shared the identical fimA genotype of P. gingivalis with their relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between Chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.
TI  - Energetics of pathogenic bacteria and opportunities for drug development.
AB  - The emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens and our inability to develop new antimicrobials to overcome resistance has inspired scientists to consider new targets for drug development. Cellular bioenergetics is an area showing promise for the development of new antimicrobials, particularly in the discovery of new anti-tuberculosis drugs where several new compounds have entered clinical trials. In this review, we have examined the bioenergetics of various bacterial pathogens, highlighting the versatility of electron donor and acceptor utilisation and the modularity of electron transport chain components in bacteria. In addition to re-examining classical concepts, we explore new literature that reveals the intricacies of pathogen energetics, for example, how Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni exploit host and microbiota to derive powerful electron donors and sinks; the strategies Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa use to persist in lung tissues; and the importance of sodium energetics and electron bifurcation in the chemiosmotic anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum. A combination of physiological, biochemical, and pharmacological data suggests that, in addition to the clinically-approved target F1Fo-ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase type II, succinate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, cytochrome bd oxidase, and menaquinone biosynthesis pathways are particularly promising next-generation drug targets. The realisation of cellular energetics as a rich target space for the development of new antimicrobials will be dependent upon gaining increased understanding of the energetic processes utilised by pathogens in host environments and the ability to design bacterial-specific inhibitors of these processes.
TI  - Oral Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli as a reservoir of beta-lactam resistance genes facilitating infections with multiresistant bacteria.
AB  - Many beta-lactamases have been described in various Gram-negative bacilli (Capnocytophaga, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, etc.) of the oral cavity, belonging to class A of the Ambler classification (CepA, CblA, CfxA, CSP-1 and TEM), class B (CfiA) or class D in Fusobacterium nucleatum (FUS-1). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactams are variable and this variation is often related to the presence of plasmids or other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that modulate the expression of resistance genes. DNA persistence and bacterial promiscuity in oral biofilms also contribute to genetic transformation and conjugation in this particular microcosm. Overexpression of efflux pumps is facilitated because the encoding genes are located on MGEs, in some multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, similar to conjugative transposons harbouring genes encoding beta-lactamases. All these facts lead us to consider the oral cavity as an important reservoir of beta-lactam resistance genes and a privileged place for genetic exchange, especially in commensal strictly anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Term and preterm labour are associated with distinct microbial community structures in placental membranes which are independent of mode of delivery.
AB  - Infection is considered a possible trigger for preterm labour, supported by evidence showing the presence of bacteria in the placenta and placental membranes from preterm births. In this study, 16S rDNA pyrosequencing was used to identify bacteria in placental membranes. Caesarean sections and vaginal deliveries at term were found to harbour common genera. Mycoplasma hominis, Aerococcus christensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were either only present in preterm membranes or in greater abundance than at term. These data support previous studies that used either targeted qPCR or broad-range 16S rDNA PCR and cloning but not a recent microbiome analysis of placental tissue using high-throughput sequencing.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of PGLa-AM1, CPF-AM1, and magainin-AM1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (HDPs). Three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-AM1), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AM1) and magainin-AM1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the African volcano frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by microbroth dilution. PGLa-AM1 and CPF-AM1 were particularly active against Streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. A type strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. PGLa-AM1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All three peptides showed less binding to P. gingivalis LPS than to LPS from the other species studied. Oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 muM peptide treatments. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 muM magainin-AM1 but not following treatment with PGLa-AM1 or CPF-AM1. In conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the X. amieti peptides bound to LPS from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.
TI  - Regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (AM) and nitric oxide (NO). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Regulation of AM and NO production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Veillonella atypica, Streptococcus salivarius and Candida albicans was examined. AM and NO were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (NO metabolites) Griess assay respectively. Cellular production of AM and inducible NO synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The inter-relationship of AM and NO production were further investigated with macrophages. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus induced maximal levels of both AM and NO after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral keratinocytes. AM production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible NO synthase inhibitor, Nomega -Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. Likewise, NO production was increased upon exposure to AM, while the AM receptor antagonist AM 22-52 reduced the release of NO. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, P. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia, and commensals, S. salivarius and V. atypica, as regards the upregulation of AM and NO production from oral keratinocytes. Interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. Understanding the coordinated regulation of AM and NO production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogens in the patients with aortic aneurysm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence and development of aortic aneurysm (AA) are associated with infection. Some researchers have detected the DNA of periodontal pathogens in AA samples in certain populations. However, it has not been done in Chinese population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in oral tissue samples and aneurysm samples of AA patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine subjects with AA and 59 subjects without AA were examined. Periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated. Unstimulated saliva and subgingival plaque samples were collected from all subjects. Twenty-six dissected AA samples were obtained. Evidence of eight periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), and Prevotella nigrescens (Pn) was ascertained in all samples by 16S rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: The periodontal indexes including plaque index (PLI), probing depth (PD), bleeding index (BI), and clinical attachment loss (CAL), of the six Ramfjord index teeth were significantly higher in the AA group than those in the control group (P < 0.01). Eight periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples were more frequently detected in the AA group than in control group. The difference in prevalence between the groups was significant for six (out of eight) periodontal pathogens assayed (Pg, Pi, Fn, Pn, Tf, and Td, P < 0.01). Additionally, all eight periodontal pathogens were more frequently detected in saliva samples of the AA group than in those of the control group, again with six (out of eight) (Pg, Pi, Fn, Cr, Tf, and Td) displaying significant differences in prevalence between the two groups (P < 0.01). Out of 26 aneurysm samples examined, Pg, Pi, Fn, Cr and Tf were detected in 6 (23.1%), 2 (7.7%), 3 (11.5%), 1 (3.8%), 2 (7.7%), respectively, and Aa, Pn, and Td were not detected in dissected aneurysm samples. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggested that periodontal infection is associated with the occurrence of AA.
TI  - Shifts in Campylobacter species abundance may reflect general microbial community shifts in periodontitis progression.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral Campylobacter species have been found to be associated with periodontitis progression. While the etiological significance of Campylobacter rectus is quite established, the association of C. gracilis, C. concisus, and C. curvus with health or disease remains contradictory. OBJECTIVES: This study hypothesizes that the proportion of species within the Campylobacter genus rather than the absolute abundance of a single species is a suitable indicator for periodontitis progression. DESIGN: Subgingival plaque from 90 periodontitis patients and gingival sulcus fluid of 32 healthy individuals were subjected to a newly developed nested PCR approach, in which all Campylobacter spp. were amplified simultaneously. The resulting mixture of 16S-rRNA-gene-amplicons were separated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing and identification of excised bands and relative quantification of band intensities. In all samples, the abundance of selected periodontitis marker species was determined based on DNA hybridization on a microarray. RESULTS: The highly prevalent Campylobacter community was composed of varying proportions of C. rectus, C. gracilis, C. concisus, and C. curvus. Cluster analysis based on SSCP-banding pattern resulted in distinct groups which in turn coincided with significant differences in abundance of established periodontitis marker species (Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and progression. CONCLUSIONS: The shift in the Campylobacter community composition seems to display the general microbial community shift during clinical progression in a simplified manner. The focus on members of the Campylobacter in this study suggests that this genus can be an indicator of ecological changes in the subgingival oral microflora.
TI  - Action of essential oils from Brazilian native and exotic medicinal species on oral biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential oils (EO) obtained from twenty medicinal and aromatic plants were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the EO was evaluates by microdilution method determining Minimal Inhibitory Concentration. Chemical analysis of the oils compounds was performed by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS). The most active EO were also investigated as to their actions on the biolfilm formation. RESULTS: The most of the essential oils (EO) presented moderate to strong antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens (MIC--Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations values between 0.007 and 1.00 mg/mL). The essential oil from Coriandrum sativum inhibited all oral species with MIC values from 0.007 to 0.250 mg/mL, and MBC/MFC (Minimal Bactericidal/Fungicidal Concentrations) from 0.015 to 0.500 mg/mL. On the other hand the essential oil of C. articulatus inhibited 63.96% of S. sanguis biofilm formation. Through Scanning Eletronic Microscopy (SEM) images no changes were observed in cell morphology, despite a decrease in biofilm formation and changes on biofilm structure. Chemical analysis by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) of the C. sativum essential oil revealed major compounds derivatives from alcohols and aldehydes, while Cyperus articulatus and Aloysia gratissima (EOs) presented mono and sesquiterpenes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the crude oil from C. articulatus exhibited the best results of antimicrobial activity e ability to control biofilm formation. The chemical analysis showed the presence of terpenes and monoterpenes such as a-pinene, a-bulnesene and copaene. The reduction of biofilms formation was confirmed from SEM images. The results of this research shows a great potential from the plants studied as new antimicrobial sources.
TI  - Diverse allosteric and catalytic functions of tetrameric d-lactate dehydrogenases from three Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - NAD-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenases (d-LDHs) reduce pyruvate into d-lactate with oxidation of NADH into NAD(+). Although non-allosteric d-LDHs from Lactobacilli have been extensively studied, the catalytic properties of allosteric d-LDHs from Gram-negative bacteria except for Escherichia coli remain unknown. We characterized the catalytic properties of d-LDHs from three Gram-negative bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum (FNLDH), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PALDH), and E. coli (ECLDH) to gain an insight into allosteric mechanism of d-LDHs. While PALDH and ECLDH exhibited narrow substrate specificities toward pyruvate like usual d-LDHs, FNLDH exhibited a broad substrate specificity toward hydrophobic 2-ketoacids such as 2-ketobutyrate and 2-ketovalerate, the former of which gave a 2-fold higher k cat/S0.5 value than pyruvate. Whereas the three enzymes consistently showed hyperbolic shaped pyruvate saturation curves below pH 6.5, FNLDH and ECLDH, and PALDH showed marked positive and negative cooperativity, respectively, in the pyruvate saturation curves above pH 7.5. Oxamate inhibited the catalytic reactions of FNLDH competitively with pyruvate, and the PALDH reaction in a mixed manner at pH 7.0, but markedly enhanced the reactions of the two enzymes at low concentration through canceling of the apparent homotropic cooperativity at pH 8.0, although it constantly inhibited the ECLDH reaction. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and certain divalent metal ions such as Mg(2+) also markedly enhanced the reactions of FNLDH and PALDH, but none of them enhanced the reaction of ECLDH. Thus, our study demonstrates that bacterial d-LDHs have highly divergent allosteric and catalytic properties.
TI  - Periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two Chinese were included. Four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [PPD >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (BOP) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (PPD >/=4 mm). Subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to quantify six pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), Treponema denticola (T.d.), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.), Prevotella intermedia (P.i.), and Staphylococcus aureus (S.a.). Counts were log10-transformed. RESULTS: The most commonly detected species were S. a. and F. n., while A. a. and. P. i. had the lowest detection frequency. The detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. There were no statistically significant differences for any of the species or clinical sites (P > 0.05, Cochran's Q test). No statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of F. nucleatum. This was more abundant in periodontitis sites (P = 0.023, Friedman's 2-way anova). Both periodontal and peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor S. aureus cells. The log10-transformed loads of S. aureus were approximately 3.5 within each of the clinical sites (P = 0.232). This was the highest of the six species analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of health status. The prevalence and levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. A. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.
TI  - Prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of Italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 Italian patients with chronic periodontitis. Possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. At first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. The samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (Meridol(R) Perio Diagnostics, GABA International, Switzerland). Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Treponema denticola (Td), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) were investigated. Fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while Tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). Aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. Bacterial load of Pg, Td, Tf and Fn showed a direct correlation to Bleeding On Probing (BOP) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). The bacterial load was always directly correlated to Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) (p=0.0001). Among the investigated variables, PPD resulted the most important risk indicator for periodontal pathogens. BOP appeared as a risk indicator for Td, Tf, Pg detection. Few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the Italian population. Considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.
TI  - Essential oils and isolated compounds from Lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  - In the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Br. (L. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. The periodontal pathogens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans; ATCC 43717), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum; ATCC 25586) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis); ATCC 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), whereas Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis; ATCC 25285) was used as the control microorganism. Osteoclast (OC) apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay and Fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. The analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that P. gingivalis had the lowest MIC values, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. L. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the OCs. This study demonstrates that L. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. In fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.
TI  - Interactions of anaerobic bacteria with dental stem cells: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with periodontitis, it is highly likely that local (progenitor) cells encounter pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this in vitro study was to elucidate how human dental follicle stem cells (hDFSC) react towards a direct challenge with anaerobic periodontal pathogens under their natural oxygen-free atmosphere. HDFSC were compared to human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSC) and differentiated primary human gingival fibroblasts (hGiF), as well as permanent gingival carcinoma cells (Ca9-22). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The different cell types were investigated in a co-culture system with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). The viability of the cells and pathogens under anaerobic conditions, as well as interactions in terms of adherence and internalization, were examined. Additionally, the release of pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 (IL-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The bacteria adhered less efficiently to hDFSC compared to Ca9-22 (P. gingivalis: 0.18% adherence to hDFSC; 3.1% adherence to Ca9-22). Similar results were observed for host cell internalization (F. nucleatum: 0.002% internalization into hDFSC; 0.09% internalization into Ca9-22). Statistically significantly less IL-8 was secreted from hDFSC after stimulation with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis in comparison with hGiF (F. nucleatum: 2080.0 pg/ml--hGiF; 19.7 pg/ml--hDFSC). The IL-10 response of the differentiated cells was found to be low in relation to their pro-inflammatory IL-8 response. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicate that dental stem cells are less prone to interactions with pathogenic bacteria than differentiated cells in an anaerobic environment. Moreover, during bacterial challenge, the stem cell immune response seems to be more towards an anti-inflammatory reaction. For a potential future therapeutic use of hDFSC, these findings support the idea of a save application.
TI  - Identification and characterization of fusolisin, the Fusobacterium nucleatum autotransporter serine protease.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral anaerobe associated with periodontal disease,  adverse pregnancy outcomes and colorectal carcinoma. A serine endopeptidase of 61-65 kDa capable of damaging host tissue and of inactivating immune effectors was detected previously in F. nucleatum. Here we describe the identification of this serine protease, named fusolisin, in three oral F. nucleatum sub-species. Gel zymogram revealed fusobacterial proteolytic activity with molecular masses ranging from 55-101 kDa. All of the detected proteases were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF. analysis revealed that all of the detected proteases are encoded by genes encoding an open reading frame (ORF) with a calculated mass of approximately 115 kDa. Bioinformatics analysis of the identified ORFs demonstrated that they consist of three domains characteristic of autotransporters of the type Va secretion system. Our results suggest that the F. nucleatum fusolisins are derived from a precursor of approximately 115 kDa. After crossing the cytoplasmic membrane and cleavage of the leader sequence, the C-terminal autotransporter domain of the remaining 96-113 kDa protein is embedded in the outer membrane and delivers the N-terminal S8 serine protease passenger domain to the outer cell surface. In most strains the N-terminal catalytic 55-65 kDa domain self cleaves and liberates itself from the autotransporter domain after its transfer across the outer cell membrane. In F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 this autocatalytic activity is less efficient resulting in a full length membrane-anchored serine protease. The mature serine protease was found to cleave after Thr, Gly, Ala and Leu residues at the P1 position. Growth of F. nucleatum in complex medium was inhibited when serine protease inhibitors were used. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether fusolisin might be used as a target for controlling fusobacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma and other plasma preparations against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to releasing a pool of growth factors during activation,  platelets have many features that indicate their role in the anti-infective host defense. The antimicrobial activities of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and related plasma preparations against periodontal disease-associated bacteria were evaluated. METHODS: Four distinct plasma fractions were extracted in the formulation used commonly in dentistry and were tested for their antibacterial properties against three periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The minimum inhibitory concentration of each plasma preparation was determined, and in vitro time-kill assays were used to detect their abilities to inhibit bacterial growth. Bacterial adhesion interference and the susceptibility of bacterial adherence by these plasma preparations were also conducted. RESULTS: All plasma preparations can inhibit bacterial growth, with PRP showing the superior activity. Bacterial growth inhibition by PRP occurred in the first 24 hours after application in the time-kill assay. PRP interfered with P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans attachment and enhanced exfoliation of attached P. gingivalis but had no influences on F. nucleatum bacterial adherence. CONCLUSIONS: PRP expressed antibacterial properties, which may be attributed to platelets possessing additional antimicrobial molecules. The application of PRP on periodontal surgical sites is advisable because of its regenerative potential and its antibacterial effects.
TI  - Effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on short chain fatty acid levels in  gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play important roles in periodontal diseases. However, the concentrations of SCFAs in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. The aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal therapy on levels of SCFAs in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (G-AgP), and analyze the concentrations of SCFAs in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with G-AgP (n = 20; mean age 24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). Concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: The clinical parameters of patients with G-AgP during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment were improved remarkably. The formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the P. gingivalis-, T. denticola-, P. intermedia- or F. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. The concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three SCFA levels were significantly higher in P. gingivalis-, T. denticola-, P. intermedia- or F. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. CONCLUSION: Non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with G-AgP, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. A marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with G-AgP was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.
TI  - Relationship of clinical and microbiological variables in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze how metabolic control of type 1 diabetes is related to clinical and microbiological periodontal parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 56 subjects aged from 19 to 50 years divided into 2 groups: healthy subjects (the H group), and diabetic (type 1 diabetes) patients with chronic untreated generalized periodontitis (the DM group). The glycosylated hemoglobin value (HbA1c) was determined using the UniCel DxC 800 SYNCHRON System (Beckman Coulter, USA), and the concentration in blood was measured by the turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. A molecular genetic assay (Micro-IDent plus, Germany) was used to detect periodontopathogenic bacteria in plaque samples. Periodontitis was confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, and Eikenella corrodens were the most frequently found bacteria in dental plaque samples (77.8%, 66.7%, and 33.4%, respectively), whereas Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified 40.7% less frequently in the DM group than in the H group. The strongest relationship was observed between the presence of 2 periodontal pathogens - F. nucleatum and Capnocytophaga spp. - and poorer metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients (HbA1c) and all clinical parameters of periodontal pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal disease was more evident in type 1 diabetic patients, and the prevalence of periodontitis was greatly increased in subjects with poorer metabolic control.
TI  - Influence of highly-active antiretroviral therapy on the subgingival biofilm in HIV-infected patients.
AB  - AIM: Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated with alterations in subgingival biofilm and periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between different HAART regimens and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in HIV-infected patients with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival periodontal pathogens were determined by a DNA chip microarray in a case series in 14 HIV-infected patients receiving HAART with different drug combinations: protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based HAART. A statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether specific HAART regimens were associated with 10 periodontal pathogens using odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: At baseline and after treatment, the patients did not show significant clinical and immunological differences. In general, the highest OR for the prevalence of periodontal pathogens were found in the PI HAART group for Actinomyces viscosus (A. viscosus) (OR: 303), Campylobacter rectus (OR: 90), and Treponema denticola (OR: 25). In the NNRTI HAART group, higher OR were documented for Fusobacterium nucleatum (OR: 56) and Eikenella corrodens (OR: 25). The association between A. viscosus and PI HAART was statistically significant (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated statistical associations between subgingival bacteria and antiretroviral drug therapies. Further investigation on the clinical significance and underlying mechanisms are needed to support these findings.
TI  - Subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in Korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  - Smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. However, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. Here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in Korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing. A total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. Differences in bacterial communities between smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. The genera Fusobacterium, Fretibacterium, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Corynebacterium, TM7, and Filifactor were abundant in smokers. On the other hand, Prevotella, Campylobacter, Aggregatibacter, Veillonellaceae GQ422718, Haemophilus, and Prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. Among species-level taxa occupying > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria oralis, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Veillonella dispar, Filifactor alocis, and Fretibacterium AY349371. On the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or OTUs was found in smokers: Neisseria elongata, six Prevotella species or OTUs, Fusobacterium canifelinum, Aggregatibacter AM420165, Selenomonas OTU, and Veillonellaceae GU470897. Species richness and evenness were similar between the groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in Korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.
TI  - Hydrogen sulfide production from subgingival plaque samples.
AB  - Periodontitis is a polymicrobial anaerobe infection. Little is known about the dysbiotic microbiota and the role of bacterial metabolites in the disease process. It is suggested that the production of certain waste products in the proteolytic metabolism may work as markers for disease severity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas produced by degradation of proteins in the subgingival pocket. It is highly toxic and believed to have pro-inflammatory properties. We aimed to study H2S production from subgingival plaque samples in relation to disease severity in subjects with natural development of the disease, using a colorimetric method based on bismuth precipitation. In remote areas of northern Thailand, adults with poor oral hygiene habits and a natural development of periodontal disease were examined for their oral health status. H2S production was measured with the bismuth method and subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for the presence of 20 bacterial species with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. In total, 43 subjects were examined (age 40-60 years, mean PI 95 +/- 6.6%). Fifty-six percent had moderate periodontal breakdown (CAL > 3 < 7 mm) and 35% had severe periodontal breakdown (CAL > 7 mm) on at least one site. Parvimonas micra, Filifactor alocis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently detected. H2S production could not be correlated to periodontal disease severity (PPD or CAL at sampled sites) or to a specific bacterial composition. Site 21 had statistically lower production of H2S (p = 0.02) compared to 16 and 46. Betel nut chewers had statistically significant lower H2S production (p = 0.01) than non-chewers. Rapid detection and estimation of subgingival H2S production capacity was easily and reliably tested by the colorimetric bismuth sulfide precipitation method. H2S may be a valuable clinical marker for degradation of proteins in the subgingival pocket.
TI  - [Effects of cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets on halitosis induced by oral  conditions].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets on halitosis induced by oral conditions. METHODS: With Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum as the testing bacteria, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets was determined using minute amount serial dilution test. The production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) was measured using sulfide detector halimeter in the anaerobic bacteria culture at 4 and 8 h after addition of the tablets. The effect of the tablets in suppressing odor production by mouth-borne halitosis bacteria was assessed using cysteine challenge test in healthy volunteers, and the effectiveness was evaluated by measuring the reduction in VSCs production and the duration of the effect. RESULTS: Cetylpyridinium chloride buccal tablets inhibited the growth of all the 3 bacteria. The tablets obviously inhibited VSCs production by the 3 bacteria with a effect similar to chlorhexidine. Compared with distilled water gargle, the buccal tablets significantly reduced cysteine-induced VSCs production level in the healthy volunteers (P<0.05), and the effect lasted for 230 min. CONCLUSION: Cetylpyridinium chloride tablets can obviously suppress bacteria responsible for oral halitosis and produce good effects in the treatment of halitosis induced by oral conditions.
TI  - Fusobacterium hwasookii sp. nov., Isolated from a Human Periodontitis Lesion.
AB  - In this study, we classified the five strains (ChDC F128(T), ChDC F145, ChDC F174, ChDC F206, and ChDC F300) as a novel species of genus Fusobacterium by DNA-DNA hybridization and multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (MLPA), based on a single sequence (24,715 bp) of 22 concatenated housekeeping genes, with morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics. DNA-DNA hybridization data showed that the values of genomic relatedness between ChDC F128(T) and each of the other novel strains were ranged from 79.0 to 82.6 %, while those of genomic relatedness between ChDC F128(T) and type strain of each of subspecies of F. nucleatum or Fusobacterium periodonticum were ranged from 40.9 to 54.4 %. MLPA revealed that the 5 strains were clustered as one group and clearly discriminated with F. nucleatum and F. periodonticum with 100 % bootstrap value. The DNA G+C content of the five novel strains were ranged from 26.9 to 27.0 mol%. The cellular fatty acid analysis of clinical isolates and type strains revealed C14:0, C16:0, and cis-9 C16:1 as the major fatty acids. The cell wall peptidoglycan of the 5 strains was comprised of meso-lanthionine. These results show that the 5 strains are novel species and belong to the genus Fusobacterium. Strain ChDC F128(T) (=KCOM 1249(T) = KCTC 5108(T) = JCM 30218(T)) is suggested to be the type strain of a novel species of genus Fusobacterium, for which the name Fusobacterium hwasookii sp. nov. is proposed.
TI  - Effect of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100 on multispecies oral communities.
AB  - The predation of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on different periodontal pathogens has already been described. However, it is necessary to consider the polymicrobial nature of periodontal disease. The current study explores the predation of Bdellovibrio on oral pathogens organized in multispecies communities. The effect of the predator was evaluated on in vitro six species communities with microbial culturing. Additionally, the effect on ex vivo subgingival plaque and saliva samples from periodontitis patients was assessed. In the latter experiment results were examined with microbial culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The latter technique was used to get an overview of the whole mixed microbial population. Results showed that even in more complex models, B. bacteriovorus was still able to predate on Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. However predation on Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis could not be validated in multispecies models. The effect of Bdellovibrio was not restricted to the target bacteria. Changes in the overall ecology of the different models were evident. It could be concluded that the efficiency of predation decreased when complexity of the models increased. However, B. bacteriovorus was able to attack two important oral pathogens, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, even when present in ex vivo clinical samples. These effects still have to be validated in in vivo models to see the impact of Bdellovibrio on the whole bacterial ecology.
TI  - Association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in PCOS, compared to systemic health. A total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with PCOS and healthy periodontium, 35 women with PCOS and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically healthy women with gingivitis. Salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA. In women with PCOS, salivary Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis and Tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women, particularly in the case of gingivitis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. The presence of PCOS also enhanced P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and S. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. Gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in PCOS. The presence of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. In conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, PCOS may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. The most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on P. gingivalis.
TI  - Real-time PCR quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. Most published real-time PCR assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. The aims of this study were to develop a real-time PCR assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of DNA (fg) and colony-forming unit (CFU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: TaqMan primers/probe sets were used for the detection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Eikenella corrodens (Ec), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and total bacteria. Six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals were determined. The relationship between the amount of DNA (fg) and CFU was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial DNA and CFU per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. RESULTS: Fn, Ec, and Pi were detected in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for Tf, Pg, and Aa, respectively. Numbers of Ec and Fn in saliva were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.93, P < 0.01). The values of DNA (fg) per CFU ranged from 64 for Ec to 121 for Pg. CONCLUSION: The real-time PCR assay in combination with the relationship between DNA (fg) and CFU can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (CFU). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This real-time PCR assay in combination with the relationship between DNA (fg) and CFU has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.
TI  - Bimix antimicrobial scaffolds for regenerative endodontics.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Eliminating and/or inhibiting bacterial growth within the root canal system has been shown to play a key role in the regenerative outcome. The aim of this study was to synthesize and determine in vitro both the antimicrobial effectiveness and cytocompatibility of bimix antibiotic-containing polydioxanone-based polymer scaffolds. METHODS: Antibiotic-containing (metronidazole [MET] and ciprofloxacin [CIP]) polymer solutions (distinct antibiotic weight ratios) were spun into fibers as a potential mimic to the double antibiotic paste (DAP, a MET/CIP mixture). Fiber morphology, chemical characteristics, and tensile strength were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and tensile testing, respectively. Antimicrobial efficacy was tested over time (aliquot collection) against Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). Similarly, cytotoxicity was evaluated in human dental pulp stem cells. Data were statistically analyzed (P < .05). RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that electrospinning was able to produce antibiotic-containing fibers with a diameter mostly in the nanoscale. The tensile strength of 1:1MET/CIP scaffolds was significantly (P < .05) higher than pure polydioxanone (control). Meanwhile, all other groups presented similar strength as the control. Aliquots obtained from antibiotic-containing scaffolds inhibited the growth of Ef, Pg, and Fn, except pure MET, which did not show an inhibitory action toward Pg or Fn. Antibiotic-containing aliquots promoted slight human dental pulp stem cell viability reduction, but none of them were considered to be cytotoxic. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the incorporation of multiple antibiotics within a nanofibrous scaffold holds great potential toward the development of a drug delivery system for regenerative endodontics.
TI  - The effect of sodium hypochlorite on Enterococcus faecalis when grown on dentine  as a single- and multi-species biofilm.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is often involved in the aetiology of apical periodontitis  after endodontic treatment. This project aimed to establish, on dentine in vitro, a multi-species biofilm containing E. faecalis, and to determine if the organism had an increased resistance to sodium hypochlorite compared with an axenic biofilm. Biofilms were established on dentine discs in flow cells with either E. faecalis alone (axenic) or together with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguinis. Following treatment with either 0.9% sodium hypochlorite or saline, the viability of E. faecalis was determined by serial plating and qualitative analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Viable counts indicated that 0.9% NaOCl is highly effective against E. faecalis grown alone and as part of a multi-species biofilm (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.001, respectively). No significant difference in its survival in the two biofilm types was found (P = 0.8276).
TI  - Global analysis of saliva as a source of bacterial genes for insights into human  population structure and migration studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of the human microbiome holds great potential for shedding light on the history of our ancestors. Helicobacter pylori is the most prominent example as its analysis allowed a fine-scale resolution of past migration patterns including some that could not be distinguished using human genetic markers. However studies of H. pylori require stomach biopsies, which severely limits the number of samples that can be analysed. By focussing on the house-keeping gene gdh (coding for the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), on the virulence gene gtf (coding for the glucosyltransferase) of mitis-streptococci and on the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum-group we here tested the hypothesis that bacterial genes from human saliva have the potential for distinguishing human populations. RESULTS: Analysis of 10 individuals from each of seven geographic regions, encompassing Africa, Asia and Europe, revealed that the genes gdh and ITS exhibited the highest number of polymorphic sites (59% and 79%, respectively) and most OTUs (defined at 99% identity) were unique to a given country. In contrast, the gene gtf had the lowest number of polymorphic sites (21%), and most OTUs were shared among countries. Most of the variation in the gdh and ITS genes was explained by the high clonal diversity within individuals (around 80%) followed by inter-individual variation of around 20%, leaving the geographic region as providing virtually no source of sequence variation. Conversely, for gtf the variation within individuals accounted for 32%, between individuals for 57% and among geographic regions for 11%. This geographic signature persisted upon extension of the analysis to four additional locations from the American continent. Pearson correlation analysis, pairwise Fst-cluster analysis as well as UniFrac analyses consistently supported a tree structure in which the European countries clustered tightly together and branched with American countries and South Africa, to the exclusion of Asian countries and the Congo. CONCLUSION: This study shows that saliva harbours protein-coding bacterial genes that are geographically structured, and which could potentially be used for addressing previously unresolved human migration events.
TI  - The presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. However, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. The aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. METHODS: The research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24 were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. Information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery, general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. At 12 months of age, both groups of infants were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and dental plaque samples were collected. The microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp., Actinomyces spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a PCR-based method. The chi-squared and Fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. RESULTS: The infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of Fusosbacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. Periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. A significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of S. mutans. Most of the very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of S. mutans in full-term infants than in premature infants.
TI  - Nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure CHX (Nano-CHX), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The release of CHX from the Nano-CHX was characterized by UV/visible absorption spectroscopy. The antimicrobial properties of Nano-CHX were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. The Nano-CHX demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/mL against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococccus faecalis. Moreover, Nano-CHX effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as S. mutans, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the Nano-CHX on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.
TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.
AB  - In total 122 non-duplicate Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. Most of the strains belonged to the B. fragilis group (55%), followed by Prevotella strains (34.4%) and Fusobacterium spp (10.6%). The species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. The most common isolates were B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Among Prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were P. buccae, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. denticola and P. nigrescens, and most of the Fusobacterium spp. were F. nucleatum. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the E-test methodology. The percentage of the susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (MIC </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. Three B. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). All Prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented Prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 mug/ml). The susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. All Fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.
TI  - Proteomics of Fusobacterium nucleatum within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral organism that can provide adhesive and metabolic support to developing periodontal bacterial communities. It is within the context of these communities that disease occurs. We have previously reported whole cell proteomics analyses of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii in early-stage communities with each other and with F. nucleatum, modeled using 18 h pellets. Here, we report the adaptation of F. nucleatum to the same experimental conditions as measured by differential protein expression. About 1210 F. nucleatum proteins were detected in single species F. nucleatum control samples, 1192 in communities with P. gingivalis, 1224 with S. gordonii, and 1135 with all three species. Quantitative comparisons among the proteomes revealed important changes in all mixed samples with distinct responses to P. gingivalis or S. gordonii alone and in combination. The results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using DAVID (Database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery). Extensive changes were detected in energy metabolism. All multispecies comparisons showed reductions in amino acid fermentation and a shift toward butanoate as a metabolic byproduct, although the two organism model community with S. gordonii showed increases in alanine, threonine, methionine, and cysteine pathways, and in the three species samples there were increases in lysine and methionine. The communities with P. gingivalis or all three organisms showed reduced glycolysis proteins, but F. nucleatum paired with S. gordonii displayed increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis proteins. The S. gordonii containing two organism model also showed increases in the ethanolamine pathway while the three species sample showed decreases relative to the F. nucleatum single organism control. All of the nascent model communities displayed reduced translation, lipopolysaccharide, and cell wall biosynthesis, DNA replication and DNA repair.
TI  - Microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  - AIM: To determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using HOMIM. Microbial differences among groups were examined by Mann-Whitney U-test. Regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. RESULTS: Putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. Detection of Porphyromonas endodontalis/Porphyromonas spp. (OR 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and Tannerella forsythia (OR 38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of Neisseria polysaccharea (OR 0.004 [0-0.15]) and Prevotella denticola (OR 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. Presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (OR 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), Cardiobacterium hominis (OR 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), Peptostreptococcaceae sp. (OR 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), P. alactolyticus (OR 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of Fretibacterium spp. (OR 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), Fusobacterium naviforme/Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (OR 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), Granulicatella adiacens/Granulicatella elegans (OR 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. CONCLUSION: There were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. Such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.
TI  - Drug loaded homogeneous electrospun PCL/gelatin hybrid nanofiber structures for anti-infective tissue regeneration membranes.
AB  - Infection is the major reason for guided tissue regeneration/guided bone regeneration (GTR/GBR) membrane failure in clinical application. In this work, we developed GTR/GBR membranes with localized drug delivery function to prevent infection by electrospinning of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and gelatin blended with metronidazole (MNA). Acetic acid (HAc) was introduced to improve the miscibility of PCL and gelatin to fabricate homogeneous hybrid nanofiber membranes. The effects of the addition of HAc and the MNA content (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt.% of polymer) on the properties of the membranes were investigated. The membranes showed good mechanical properties, appropriate biodegradation rate and barrier function. The controlled and sustained release of MNA from the membranes significantly prevented the colonization of anaerobic bacteria. Cells could adhere to and proliferate on the membranes without cytotoxicity until the MNA content reached 30%. Subcutaneous implantation in rabbits for 8 months demonstrated that MNA-loaded membranes evoked a less severe inflammatory response depending on the dose of MNA than bare membranes. The biodegradation time of the membranes was appropriate for tissue regeneration. These results indicated the potential for using MNA-loaded PCL/gelatin electrospun membranes as anti-infective GTR/GBR membranes to optimize clinical application of GTR/GBR strategies.
TI  - Increased proliferation and decreased membrane permeability as defense mechanisms of Fusobacterium nucleatum against human neutrophilic peptide-1.
AB  - Human neutrophilic peptides (HNPs) constitute a class of host defense molecules,  which contribute to the non-oxidative killing of bacteria and other microorganisms. Since the adaptability is crucial to bacterial survival in changing environments, it is of interest to know how Fusobacterium nucleatum, the major bridge organism connecting early and late colonizers in dental biofilms, defends itself against HNPs. This study aimed to examine the planktonic growth, membrane permeability, and biofilm formation characteristics as defense mechanisms of F. nucleatum against HNP-1. In all experiments, the type strain of F. nucleatum (ssp. nucleatum ATCC 25586) and two clinical strains (ssp. nucleatum AHN 9508 and ssp. polymorphum AHN 9910) were used. Planktonic growth (measured in colony forming units), capsular polysaccharide production (visualized by Ziehl-Neelsen stain), membrane permeability (demonstrated as N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine uptake), biofilm formation, and established biofilm development (measured as total mass and polysaccharide levels) were analyzed in the presence of 0 mug/ml (control), 1 mug/ml, 5 mug/ml, and 10 mug/ml of HNP-1. Planktonic growth of the strains AHN 9508 and ATCC 25586 were significantly (p<0.05) increased in the presence of HNP-1, while their membrane permeability decreased (p<0.005) in the planktonic form. HNP-1 decreased the biofilm formation of the strains ATCC 25586 and AHN 9910, whereas it increased the growth of the strain AHN 9508 in established biofilms. Capsule formation and polysaccharide production were not observed in any strain. We conclude that the inhibition of the membrane permeability and the increase in planktonic and established biofilm growth could act as bacterial defense mechanisms against neutrophilic defensins. In addition, this strain-dependent survival ability against HNP-1 may explain the variation in the virulence of different F. nucleatum strains.
TI  - Individual growth detection of bacterial species in an in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model.
AB  - Most in vitro studies on the antibacterial effects of antiseptics have used planktonic bacteria in monocultures. However, this study design does not reflect the in vivo situation in oral cavities harboring different bacterial species that live in symbiotic relationships in biofilms. The aim of this study was to establish a simple in vitro polymicrobial model consisting of only three bacterial strains of different phases of oral biofilm formation to simulate in vivo oral conditions. Therefore, we studied the biofilm formation of Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), and Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) on 96-well tissue culture plates under static anaerobic conditions using artificial saliva according to the method established by Pratten et al. that was supplemented with 1 g l(-1) sucrose. Growth was separately determined for each bacterial strain after incubation periods of up to 72 h by means of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and live/dead staining. Presence of an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) was visualized by Concanavalin A staining. Increasing incubation times of up to 72 h showed adhesion and propagation of the bacterial strains with artificial saliva formulation. An and Ef had significantly higher growth rates than Fn. Live/dead staining showed a median of 49.9 % (range 46.0-53.0 %) of living bacteria after 72 h of incubation, and 3D fluorescence microscopy showed a three-dimensional structure containing EPS. An in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model was established to better simulate oral conditions and had the advantage of providing the well-controlled experimental conditions of in vitro testing.
TI  - An in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. The aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. METHODS: Six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. The selected species used represent initial (Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces naeslundii), early (Veillonella parvula), secondary (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). The developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. The number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative PCR (qPCR). As outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. RESULTS: The bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. Different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. SIGNIFICANCE: While the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.
TI  - Axenic culture of a candidate division TM7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  - The diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. Candidate division TM7 bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been cultivated. In this paper, we identified candidate division TM7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. Successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division TM7 phylotypes. The bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. Proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the TM7 partial genomic sequence. Pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division TM7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. The TM7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with Actinomyces oris or Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, the TM7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, or Streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. The ability to cultivate TM7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology, genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.
TI  - Fusobacterium detected in colonic biopsy and clinicopathological features of ulcerative colitis in Japan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fusobacterium species are part of the gut microbiome in humans, but some species have been recognized as opportunistic pathogens implicated in inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases. Here, we performed prevalence screening of Fusobacterium in ulcerative colitis (UC) in Japanese patients. METHODS: We examined Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and whole Fusobacterium species (Pan-fusobacterium) by quantitative real-time PCR in 163 inflamed mucosae from 152 UC patients. Data were correlated with clinical subtypes of UC. RESULTS: In an initial prevalence screen, F. nucleatum and Pan-fusobacterium were detected in 6.3 % (4/64) and 53.1 % (34/64). For all 163 mucosae, the prevalence of Pan-fusobacterium was 54.6 % (89/163). Pan-fusobacterium status was concordant in inflamed and normal adjacent samples, and the matched cases during 1-year follow-up colonoscopy. The higher amount of Pan-fusobacterium was observed in chronic continuous type compared to one attack and relapse/remitting type (p = 0.039). The higher amount of Pan-fusobacterium was also associated with rather mild clinical course of disease, such as non-steroid dependency (p = 0.015), non-refractory phenotype (p = 0.013), and non-severe phenotype (p = 0.04). Based on the distribution of Pan-fusobacterium measurable cases, we identified 10 cases as having a high amount of Pan-fusobacterium (FB-high). The clinicopathological features of FB-high UC cases were also highlighted by chronic continuous type and mild phenotypes of disease. CONCLUSION: Whole Fusobacterium species, but not F. nucleatum, are common in UC patients and have a role in persistence of colonic inflammation in UC. However, Fusobacterium infection is associated with rather mild clinical phenotypes of UC.
TI  - Effect of an oxygenating agent on oral bacteria in vitro and on dental plaque composition in healthy young adults.
AB  - Oral bacteria live in symbiosis with the host. Therefore, when mouthwashes are indicated, selective inhibition of taxa contributing to disease is preferred instead of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The potential selectivity of an oxygenating mouthwash, Ardox-X(R) (AX), has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial potential of AX and the effects of a twice-daily oral rinse on dental plaque composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vitro, 16 oral bacterial strains were tested using agar diffusion susceptibility, minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration tests. A pilot clinical study was performed with 25 healthy volunteers. Clinical assessments and microbiological sampling of supragingival plaque were performed at 1 month before the experiment (Pre-exp), at the start of the experiment (Baseline) and after the one-week experimental period (Post-exp). During the experiment individuals used AX mouthwash twice daily in absence of other oral hygiene measures. The microbiological composition of plaque was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: AX showed high inter-species variation in microbial growth inhibition. The tested Prevotella strains and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed the highest sensitivity, while streptococci and Lactobacillus acidophilus were most resistant to AX. Plaque scores at Pre-exp and Baseline visits did not differ significantly (p = 0.193), nor did the microbial composition of plaque. During a period of 7-days non-brushing but twice daily rinsing plaque scores increased from 2.21 (0.31) at Baseline to 2.43 (0.39) Post-exp. A significant microbial shift in composition was observed: genus Streptococcus and Veillonella increased while Corynebacterium, Haemophilus, Leptotrichia, Cardiobacterium and Capnocytophaga decreased (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: AX has the potential for selective inhibition of oral bacteria. The shift in oral microbiome after 1 week of rinsing deserves further research.
TI  - Reducing the bioactivity of Tannerella forsythia lipopolysaccharide by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Tannerella forsythia is considered a pathogen of periodontitis and forms a biofilm with multi-species bacteria in oral cavity. Lipopolysaccharide is a powerful immunostimulator and induces inflammation and shock. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of T. forsythia LPS in its co-cultivation with Fusobacterium nucleatum or Porphyromonas gingivalis. T. forsythia was co-cultured in the presence and absence of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis and then T. forsythia LPS was extracted. The extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and NF-kappaB reporter CHO cell lines. THP-1 cells were treated with the LPS and evaluated induction of cytokine expression by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. For analysis of the bioactivity of T. forsythia LPS, the binding assay on LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14 was processed. The extracts did not contaminate other molecules except LPS and showed TLR4 agonists. Co-cultured T. forsythia LPS with P. gingivalis exhibited a lower level of induction of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 expression than single- or co-cultured T. forsythia LPS with F. nucleatum in the conditions of human serum. However, the three T. forsythia LPS did not show difference of cytokine induction in the serum free conditions. Co-cultured T. forsythia LPS with P. gingivalis exhibited a lower affinity to LBP and CD14 as binding site of O-antigen and attached at a lower level to THP-1 cells compared to single- or co-cultured T. forsythia LPS with F. nucleatum. The virulence of T. forsythia LPS was decreased by co-culturing with P. gingivalis and their affinity to LBP and CD14 was reduced, which may due to modification of O-antigen chain by P. gingivalis.
TI  - A comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. The present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions were employed: a. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 5% b. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 3% c. Chlorhexidine 2% d. Chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.12% e. Doxycycline 0.01% f. Doxycycline 0.005% g. MTAD. An agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. Enterococcus faecalis (MTCC-439) 2. Candida albicans (MTCC-183) 3. Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586) 4. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC-27337) The inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. The inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-Anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. By this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against different pathogens could be compared. RESULTS: MTAD showed maximum antibacterial activity. In case of C. albicans MTAD was less effective than 5% NaOCl, 3% NaOCl and 2% CHX, 0.12% CHX. However, it was more effective against E. faecalis, F. nuleatum and P. anaerobicus. In any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. E. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against C. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. CONCLUSION: It was found that MTAD was more antimicrobial than 5% NaOCl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of MTAD to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% NaOCl. In addition, 5 and 3% NaOCl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. The best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% NaOCl.
TI  - Microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. METHODOLOGY: Apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the Kyushu University Hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. DNA was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and specific fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were P. gingivalis (19.9%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and Propionibacterium acnes (9%). Bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. In addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113, Olsenella uli, Slackia exigua, Selemonas infelix, P. gingivalis with type IV fimA, and a combination of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113 and predominance of Streptococcus spp. On the other hand, neither Enterococcus faecalis nor C. albicans were detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSION: Whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. The diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.
TI  - Perio bacteria spur cancer growth in mouth.
AB  
TI  - Fever, night sweats, and abnormal liver enzymes.
AB  
TI  - Active invasion of Porphyromonas gingivalis and infection-induced complement activation in ApoE-/- mice brains.
AB  - Periodontal disease is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease that leads to chronic systemic inflammation and direct infiltration of bacteria/bacterial components, which may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. ApoE-/- mice were orally infected (n = 12) with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as mono- and polymicrobial infections. ApoE-/- mice were sacrificed following 12 and 24 weeks of chronic infection. Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from all brain tissues except for the F. nucleatum mono-infected group. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using universal 16 s rDNA primers and species-specific primer sets for each organism to determine whether the infecting pathogens accessed the brain. Sequencing amplification products confirmed the invasion of bacteria into the brain during infection. The innate immune responses were detected using antibodies against complement activation products of C3 convertase stage and the membrane attack complex. Molecular methods demonstrated that 6 out of 12 ApoE-/- mice brains contained P. gingivalis genomic DNA at 12 weeks (p = 0.006), and 9 out of 12 at 24 weeks of infection (p = 0.0001). Microglia in both infected and control groups demonstrated strong intracellular labeling with C3 and C9, due to on-going biosynthesis. The pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in 4 out of 12 infected mice brains demonstrated characteristic opsonization with C3 activation fragments (p = 0.032). These results show that the oral pathogen P. gingivalis was able to access the ApoE-/- mice brain and thereby contributed to complement activation with bystander neuronal injury.
TI  - High-level antimicrobial efficacy of representative Mediterranean natural plant extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Nature is an unexplored reservoir of novel phytopharmaceuticals. Since biofilm-related oral diseases often correlate with antibiotic resistance, plant-derived antimicrobial agents could enhance existing treatment options. Therefore, the rationale of the present report was to examine the antimicrobial impact of Mediterranean natural extracts on oral microorganisms. Five different extracts from Olea europaea, mastic gum, and Inula viscosa were tested against ten bacteria and one Candida albicans strain. The extraction protocols were conducted according to established experimental procedures. Two antimicrobial assays--the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assay--were applied. The screened extracts were found to be active against each of the tested microorganisms. O. europaea presented MIC and MBC ranges of 0.07-10.00 mg mL(-1) and 0.60-10.00 mg mL(-1), respectively. The mean MBC values for mastic gum and I. viscosa were 0.07-10.00 mg mL(-1) and 0.15-10.00 mg mL(-1), respectively. Extracts were less effective against C. albicans and exerted bactericidal effects at a concentration range of 0.07-5.00 mg mL(-1) on strict anaerobic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Parvimonas micra). Ethyl acetate I. viscosa extract and total mastic extract showed considerable antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms and could therefore be considered as alternative natural anti-infectious agents.
TI  - Pathogenic bacterial species associated with endodontic infection evade innate immune control by disabling neutrophils.
AB  - Endodontic infections, in which oral bacteria access the tooth pulp chamber, are  common and do not resolve once established. To investigate the effects of these infections on the innate immune response, we established a mouse subcutaneous chamber model, where a mixture of four oral pathogens commonly associated with these infections (endodontic pathogens [EP]), i.e., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius, Parvimonas micra, and Prevotella intermedia, was inoculated into subcutaneously implanted titanium chambers. Cells that infiltrated the chamber after these infections were primarily neutrophils; however, these neutrophils were unable to control the infection. Infection with a nonpathogenic oral bacterial species, Streptococcus mitis, resulted in well-controlled infection, with bacterial numbers reduced by 4 to 5 log units after 7 days. Propidium iodide (PI) staining of the chamber neutrophils identified three distinct populations: neutrophils from EP-infected chambers were intermediate in PI staining, while cells in chambers from mice infected with S. mitis were PI positive (apoptotic) or negative (live). Strikingly, neutrophils from EP-infected chambers were severely impaired in their ability to phagocytose and to generate reactive oxygen species in vitro after removal from the chamber compared to cells from S. mitis-infected chambers. The mechanism of neutrophil impairment was necrotic cell death as determined by morphological analyses. P. intermedia alone could induce a similar neutrophil phenotype. We conclude that the endodontic pathogens, particularly P. intermedia, can efficiently disable and kill infiltrating neutrophils, allowing these infections to become established. These results can help explain the persistence of endodontic infections and demonstrate a new virulence mechanism associated with P. intermedia.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Bacterial periplasmic sialic acid-binding proteins exhibit a conserved binding site.
AB  - Sialic acids are a family of related nine-carbon sugar acids that play important  roles in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. These sialic acids are incorporated/decorated onto lipooligosaccharides as terminal sugars in multiple bacteria to evade the host immune system. Many pathogenic bacteria scavenge sialic acids from their host and use them for molecular mimicry. The first step of this process is the transport of sialic acid to the cytoplasm, which often takes place using a tripartite ATP-independent transport system consisting of a periplasmic binding protein and a membrane transporter. In this paper, the structural characterization of periplasmic binding proteins from the pathogenic bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum, Pasteurella multocida and Vibrio cholerae and their thermodynamic characterization are reported. The binding affinities of several mutations in the Neu5Ac binding site of the Haemophilus influenzae protein are also reported. The structure and the thermodynamics of the binding of sugars suggest that all of these proteins have a very well conserved binding pocket and similar binding affinities. A significant conformational change occurs when these proteins bind the sugar. While the C1 carboxylate has been identified as the primary binding site, a second conserved hydrogen-bonding network is involved in the initiation and stabilization of the conformational states.
TI  - Biomechanical loading modulates proinflammatory and bone resorptive mediators in  bacterial-stimulated PDL cells.
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate in vitro whether biomechanical loading modulates proinflammatory and bone remodeling mediators production by periodontal ligament (PDL) cells in the presence of bacterial challenge. Cells were seeded on BioFlex culture plates and exposed to Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586 and/or cyclic tensile strain (CTS) of low (CTSL) and high (CTSH) magnitudes for 1 and 3 days. Synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was evaluated by ELISA. Gene expression and protein secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. F. nucleatum increased the production of COX2 and PGE2, which was further increased by CTS. F. nucleatum-induced increase of PGE2 synthesis was significantly (P < 0.05) increased when CTSH was applied at 1 and 3 days. In addition, CTSH inhibited the F. nucleatum-induced upregulation of OPG at 1 and 3 days, thereby increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio. OPG and RANKL mRNA results correlated with the protein results. In summary, our findings provide original evidence that CTS can enhance bacterial-induced syntheses of molecules associated with inflammation and bone resorption by PDL cells. Therefore, biomechanical, such as orthodontic or occlusal, loading may enhance the bacterial-induced inflammation and destruction in periodontitis.
TI  - Development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. Understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. Therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. We therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) and gold standard chlorhexidine (CHX) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: An in vitro multi-species biofilm containing S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in OKF6-TERT2. Cytotoxicity studies were performed using RSV and CHX. Multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. Biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. RESULTS: CHX was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. RSV did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. In co-culture, CHX-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine IL-8 at both mRNA and protein level. RSV-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of IL-8 protein, but not mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: CHX possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. RSV does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. This study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use of a biofilm co-culture model.
TI  - Fusobacterium and Enterobacteriaceae: important players for CRC?
AB  - The gut microbiota plays an essential role in regulating intestinal homeostasis through its capacity to modulate various biological activities ranging from barrier, immunity and metabolic function. Not surprisingly, microbial dysbiosis is associated with numerous intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In this piece, we will review recent evidence that gut microbial dysbiosis can influence intestinal disease, including colitis and CRC. We will discuss the biological events implicated in the development of microbial dysbiosis and the emergence of CRC-associated microorganisms, focusing on Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Finally, the mechanisms by which E. coli and F. nucleatum exert potentially carcinogenic effects on the host will be reviewed.
TI  - Identification of occult Fusobacterium nucleatum central nervous system infection by use of PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are often difficult to detect, especially after the initiation of antibiotics. We describe the application of PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) using a sample of cerebrospinal fluid to identify an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in a patient with "culture-negative" meningitis and cerebral abscesses.
TI  - Colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. This in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola). METHODS: The grown biofilm consisted of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella dispar, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, T. denticola, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". After 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected S. oralis, but not other species. The "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. A co-localisation trend was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola, as determined by FISH. However, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially S. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSIONS: While the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. This antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - The influence of orthodontic fixed appliances on the oral microbiota: a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that the presence of orthodontic fixed appliances influences the oral microbiota. METHODS: The search for articles was conducted in PubMed; ISI Web of Knowledge and Ovid databases, including articles published in English until May 17th, 2012. They should report human observational studies presenting the following keywords: "fixed orthodontic appliance" AND "microbiological colonization"; OR "periodontal pathogens"; OR "Streptococcus"; OR "Lactobacillus"; OR "Candida"; OR "Tannerella forsythia"; OR "Treponema denticola"; OR "Fusobacterium nucleatum"; OR "Actimomyces actinomycetemcomitans"; OR "Prevotella intermedia"; OR "Prevotella nigrescens"; OR "Porphyromonas gingivalis". Articles were previously selected by title and abstract. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed and classified as having low, moderate or high methodology quality. A new detailed checklist for quality assessment was developed based on the information required for applicable data extraction for reviews. The study design, sample, follow-up period, collection and microbial analysis methods, statistical treatment, results and discussion were assessed. RESULTS: The initial search retrieved 305 articles of which 33 articles were selected by title and abstract. After full-text reading, 8 articles met the inclusion criteria, out of which 4 articles were classified as having low and 4 as moderate methodological quality. The moderate methodological quality studies were included in the systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: The literature revealed moderate evidence that the presence of fixed appliances influences the quantity and quality of oral microbiota.
TI  - Gastrointestinal Variant of Lemierre Syndrome: Fusobacterium nucleatum Bacteremia-Associated Hepatic Vein Thrombosis: a Case Report and Literature Review.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative bacillius commonly found in oropharynx and is traditionally associated with Lemierre syndrome, which is characterized by history of recent oropharyngeal infection, internal jugular vein thrombosis, and isolation of anaerobic pathogens, mainly Fuosobacterium necrophorum. However, recent evidence indicated that F. nucleatum is also a normal resident of human gut. Less than a dozen of case reports had linked F. nucleatum to gastrointestinal variant of Lemierre syndrome with portal vein thrombosis. However, F. nucleatum bacteremia-associated hepatic vein thrombosis is very rare. We report a case of a 73-year-old man who had hepatic vein thrombosis associated with F. nucleatum bacteremia, most likely from subclinical primary infection affecting the lower gastrointestinal tract. The underlying pathophysiology and treatment options are discussed here. With rapid increase in reporting of Lemierre syndrome, this case deserves particular attention from clinicians.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of cefovecin against anaerobic bacteria isolated from subgingival plaque of dogs and cats with periodontal disease.
AB  - Periodontal disease is a common disease of dogs and cats often requiring antimicrobial treatment as an adjunct to mechanical debridement. However, correct compliance with oral antimicrobial therapy in companion animals is often difficult. Cefovecin is a recently introduced veterinary cephalosporin that has demonstrated prolonged concentrations in extracellular fluid, allowing for dosing intervals of up to 14 days. Subgingival samples were collected from the oral cavity of 29 dogs and eight cats exhibiting grade 2 or grade 3 periodontal disease. Samples were cultivated on Wilkin Chalgrens agar and incubated in an anaerobic chamber for seven days. Selected anaerobic bacteria were isolated and identified to species level using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for cefovecin and six additional antimicrobials using the agar dilution methodology recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The 65 clinical isolates were identified as Porphyromonas gulae (n = 45), Porphyromonas crevioricanis (n = 12), Porphyromonas macacae (n = 1), Porphyromonas cangingivalis (n = 1) Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 2), Fusobacterium russii (n = 1) and Solobacterium moorei (n = 3). This is the first report of S. moorei being isolated from companion animals with periodontal disease. All isolates were highly susceptible to cefovecin, with a MIC90 of </=0.125 mug/ml. Conversely, different resistance rates to ampicillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin between isolates were detected. Cefovecin is thus shown to be effective in vitro against anaerobic bacteria isolated from dogs and cats with periodontal disease.
TI  - Effects of stress hormones on the production of volatile sulfur compounds by periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of halitosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of adrenaline (ADR), noradrenaline (NA) and cortisol (CORT) on bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), the major gases responsible for bad breath. Cultures of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas endodontalis (Pe), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were exposed to 50 microM ADR, NA and CORT or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and 24 h. Growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. Portable gas chromatography was used to measure VSC concentrations. Kruskal-Wallis and the Dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. For Fn, ADR, NA and CORT significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). All the substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production (p<0.05). For Pe, all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and NA significantly increased the H2S concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). In the Pg and Pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). In the Pi cultures, ADR, NA and CORT increased H2S (p<0.05). Catecholamines and cortisol can interfere with growth and H2S production of sub-gingival species in vitro. This process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress and the production of VSC.
TI  - Rapid brain death caused by a cerebellar abscess with Fusobacterium nucleatum in  a young man with drug abuse: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a strict anaerobic microorganism that causes disease entities such as periodontal and soft tissue abscesses, pulmonary and intraabdominal infections and very rarely intracerebral infections. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the rare case of a previously healthy 25-year-old German man with a cerebellar abscess caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum that resulted in rapid brain death. Toxicological screening showed positivity for amphetamines and cannabis. The diagnosis was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: In drug users clinicians should think about rare causes of brain abscesses/meningitis. Early diagnosis is necessary and justifies the use of molecular techniques.
TI  - The Interaction of Implant Luting Cements and Oral Bacteria Linked to Peri-Implant Disease: An In Vitro Analysis of Planktonic and Biofilm Growth - A Preliminary Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little consensus on the most appropriate cement to use when  restoring a cement-retained, implant-supported restoration. One consideration should be the interaction of pathogenic oral bacteria with restorative cements. PURPOSE: To determine how oral bacteria associated with peri-implant disease grow in the presence of implant cements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five test cements with varying composition (zinc oxide-eugenol [TBO], eugenol-free zinc oxide [TBNE], zinc orthophosphate [FL], and two resin cements [PIC and ML]) were used to fabricate specimen disks. The disks were submerged in bacterial suspensions of either Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, or Porphyromonas gingivalis. Planktonic bacterial growth within the test media was measured by determining the optical density of the cultures (OD600 ). Positive controls (media and bacteria without cement disks) and negative controls (media alone) were similarly evaluated. The mean and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for planktonic growth from three separate experiments. ANOVA statistical analysis with post hoc Tukey tests was performed where differences existed (p < .05). Selected cement disks (TBO and ML) were further examined for bacterial biofilm growth. Surface bacteria were removed and grown on agar media, and colony-forming units (CFUs) were quantified. RESULTS: Planktonic growth for both A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis was significantly inhibited (p < .05) when grown in the presence of cement disks consisting of TBNE, PIC, FL, and TBO. In contrast, neither of these bacteria displayed growth inhibition in the presence of ML cement disks. F. nucleatum growth was also significantly inhibited by PIC, FL. and TBO (p < .05), but not by ML and TBNE cement disks. CFU counts for the biofilm study for TBO gave minimal and, in some instances, no bacterial adherence and growth, in contrast to ML, which supported substantially greater bacterial biofilm growth. CONCLUSION: Cements display differing abilities to inhibit both planktonic and biofilm bacterial growth. Cements with the ability to reduce planktonic or biofilm growth of the test bacteria may be advantageous in reducing peri-implant disease. Understanding the microbial growth-inhibiting characteristics of different cement types should be considered important in the selection criteria.
TI  - Ubiquitous sialometabolism present among oral fusobacteria.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a ubiquitous member of the human oral flora and is associated with the development of periodontitis and a variety of other types of polymicrobial infections of the mucosa. In the oral cavity, this species is one of the few that is prevalent in both healthy and diseased subgingival plaque. Using microarray analysis, we examined the transcriptional response of F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum to whole blood in order to identify some of the genetic responses that might occur during the transition from health to disease. From these studies, we identified a sialic acid catabolism operon that was induced by the presence of blood. We subsequently confirmed that this operon was inducible by the presence of synthetic sialic acid, but we found no evidence suggesting sialic acid was used as a major carbon source. However, this organism was found to possess a de novo synthesized surface sialylation ability that is widely conserved among the various F. nucleatum subspecies as well as in F. periodonticum. We provide evidence that fusobacterial sialylation does occur in the oral cavity irrespective of health status. Interestingly, only a minority of fusobacterial cells exhibit surface sialylation within dental plaque, whereas most cells are uniformly sialylated when grown in pure culture. The implications of these results are discussed.
TI  - The antibiofilm activity of lingonberry flavonoids against oral pathogens is a case connected to residual complexity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) was evaluated against two oral pathogens, Streptococcus mutans and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Long-bed gel permeation chromatography (GPC; Sephadex LH-20) yielded purified flavonoids, with the most efficient minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against planktonic cells in the anthocyanin and procyanidin primary fractions against F. nucleatum (63-125 mug/ml) and in the procyanidin rich fraction against S. mutans (16-31 mug/ml). The purified flavonol glycosides and procyanidins inhibited biofilm formation of S. mutans (MICs 16-31 mug/ml), while the corresponding reference compounds showed no activity. Secondary GPC purification yielded flavonol glycosides devoid of antibiofilm activity in the 50% MeOH fraction, while elution with 70% acetone recovered a brownish material with activity against S. mutans biofilm (MIC 8 mug/ml). Even after HPLC-PDA, NMR, and MALDI-TOF analyses, the structural identity of this material remained unknown, while its color and analytical characteristics appear to be consistent with flavonoid oxidation products.
TI  - The Kampo medicine Rokumigan possesses antibiofilm, anti-inflammatory, and wound  healing properties.
AB  - Periodontal diseases, which are inflammatory diseases of bacterial origin affecting the tooth-supporting tissues, are characterized by inflammation and destruction of gingival connective tissue and alveolar bone, and may lead to tooth loss. The aim of the study was to investigate Rokumigan, a Kampo Japanese traditional medicine made of six different plants, for its capacity to prevent biofilm formation by Fusobacterium nucleatum, to inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion by mucosal cells, and to promote wound healing in a fibroblast model. Using a microplate colorimetric assay, Rokumigan prevented biofilm formation by F. nucleatum, while it had no effect on bacterial growth. Rokumigan inhibited IL-6 secretion in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. However, it caused no significant inhibition of IL-8 secretion by both cell types. Rokumigan significantly increased proliferation and migration of gingival fibroblasts in a wound healing assay. In conclusion, the Kampo formulation Rokumigan, through suppression of biofilm formation by F. nucleatum, inhibition of IL-6 secretion by gingival epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and promotion of wound healing in a fibroblast model, may have potential application for periodontal diseases.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of traumatized teeth treated with triple antibiotic paste or calcium hydroxide with 2% chlorhexidine gel in pulp revascularization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Revascularization outcome depends on microbial elimination because  apical repair will not happen in the presence of infected tissues. This study evaluated the microbial composition of traumatized immature teeth and assessed their reduction during different stages of the revascularization procedures performed with 2 intracanal medicaments. METHODS: Fifteen patients (7-17 years old) with immature teeth were submitted to the revascularization procedures; they were divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medicament used: TAP group (n = 7), medicated with a triple antibiotic paste, and CHP group (n = 8), dressed with calcium hydroxide + 2% chlorhexidine gel. Samples were taken before any treatment (S1), after irrigation with 6% NaOCl (S2), after irrigation with 2% chlorhexidine (S3), after intracanal dressing (S4), and after 17% EDTA irrigation (S5). Cultivable bacteria recovered from the 5 stages were counted and identified by means of polymerase chain reaction assay (16S rRNA). RESULTS: Both groups had colony-forming unit counts significantly reduced after S2 (P < .05); however, no significant difference was found between the irrigants (S2 and S3, P = .99). No difference in bacteria counts was found between the intracanal medicaments used (P = .95). The most prevalent bacteria detected were Actinomyces naeslundii (66.67%), followed by Porphyromonas endodontalis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, which were detected in 33.34% of the root canals. An average of 2.13 species per canal was found, and no statistical correlation was observed between bacterial species and clinical/radiographic features. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profile of infected immature teeth is similar to that of primarily infected permanent teeth. The greatest bacterial reduction was promoted by the irrigation solutions. The revascularization protocols that used the tested intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing viable bacteria in necrotic immature teeth.
TI  - Internal bacterial colonization of implants: association with peri-implant bone loss.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present longitudinal study was to investigate bacterial colonization of the internal implant cavity and to evaluate a possible association with peri-implant bone loss. METHODS: A total of 264 paper point samples were harvested from the intra-implant cavity of 66 implants in 26 patients immediately following implant insertion and after 3, 4, and 12 months. Samples were evaluated for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia as well as total bacterial counts by real-time PCR. Bone loss was evaluated on standardized radiographs up to 25 months after implant insertion. For the statistical analysis of the data, mixed effects models were fitted. RESULTS: There was an increase in the frequency of detection as well as in the mean counts of the selected bacteria over time. The evaluation of the target bacteria revealed a significant association of Pr. intermedia at 4 and 12 months with peri-implant bone loss at 25 months (4 months: P = 0.009; 12 months: P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The present study could demonstrate a progressive colonization by periodontopathogenic bacteria in the internal cavities of two-piece implants. The results suggest that internal colonization with Pr. intermedia was associated with peri-implant bone loss.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. Recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. The causative bacterial species in Israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of LAgP in this population. The objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an Israeli LAgP population who were also clinically assessed. METHODS: Twenty-one LAgP patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. Bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. RESULTS: Higher levels of Parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), Fusobacterium nucleatum/F. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and Tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the LAgP group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were higher in the CP group. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of LAgP patients in Israel is mainly comprised of P. micra, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum/F. periodonticum and T. forsythia. Similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of LAgP when individual sampling is not possible.
TI  - Intestinal dysbiosis: novel mechanisms by which gut microbes trigger and prevent  disease.
AB  - New research has identified specific intestinal colonizing microbes that can have significant influence on health and disease. Evidence is reviewed supporting an association between Fusobacterium nucleatum and colon cancer and for a protective role of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in inflammatory bowel disease, of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in acute intestinal inflammation, of Bifidobacterium infantis in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, and of Akkermansia muciniphila in obesity and diabetes. These novel bacteria are clinically relevant and present opportunities for more focused diagnosis of colon cancer and prevention of common diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of periodontal pathogens of the mandibular third molar pericoronitis by using real time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the mandibular third molar pericoronitis flora by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quantitative values of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Tannerella forsythia (Tf) were evaluated in comparison with the healthy third molar flora by using real time PCR. RESULTS: Aa, Cr, Pg, and Pi were not statistically significant but numerically higher than the pericoronitis group. In contrast to samples from control subjects, statistically significant higher numbers of Tf were detected in samples from pericoronitis patients. The study revealed the strong relation between risk of pericoronitis and the presence of Tf. Individuals who have Tf in their samples present with an almost eight times relative risk of pericoronitis as the individuals with an absence of Tf in their samples. CONCLUSION: Tf plays an important role in the development of clinical symptoms related to pericoronitis.
TI  - Subgingival bacteria in Ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes subgingival bacterial profiles associated with clinical periodontal status in Ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 500 adolescents included in a cohort study, 397 returned 2 years later for a periodontal re-examination, including full-mouth CAL measurements. At follow-up, a subgroup of 98 adolescents was also subjected to bacterial sampling with paper points at four periodontal sites (mesial aspect of 11, 26, 31, and 46) and analyzed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique against DNA-probes from nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species. RESULTS: The 98 Ghanaian adolescents examined in the present study were similar to the entire group examined at the 2-year follow-up with respect to age, gender, and CAL >/=3 mm. A high detection frequency of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia (>99%) using checkerboard analysis was found, while for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans the detection frequency was <50%. A strong correlation was found at the individual level between the presence of P. intermedia and the total CAL change, and P. intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis were strongly correlated with a change in CAL and probing pocket depth (PPD) at the sampled sites. In a linear regression model, a significant discriminating factor for the total CAL change in the dentition during the 2-year follow-up period was obtained for P. intermedia and public school. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that subgingival bacterial species other than A. actinomycetemcomitans, for example, P. intermedia, have a significant association with periodontal breakdown (change in CAL) in Ghanaian adolescents with progression of periodontal attachment loss.
TI  - Relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. The aim of this study was to explore relationships among hBDs, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. The relative expression of hBD1, hBD2 and hBD3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time PCR. The numbers of total bacteria and of Treponema denticola, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time PCR. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's rank correlation test. RESULTS: No significant differences in expression of the hBD genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. Total bacteria and T. denticola were detected in all participants. F. nucleatum and T. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. The prevalence of all bacteria, except A. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). A significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hBD-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). Upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hBD-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: The negative correlations between hBD-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hBDs may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.
TI  - Microbial mucosal colonic shifts associated with the development of colorectal cancer reveal the presence of different bacterial and archaeal biomarkers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies demonstrate a link between gastrointestinal cancers and environmental factors such as diet. It has been suggested that environmental cancer risk is determined by the interaction between diet and microbes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that microbiota composition during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression might differ depending on the stage of the disease. METHODS: A total of 28 age-matched and sex-matched subjects, seven with CRC adenocarcinoma, 11 with tubular adenomas and ten healthy subjects with intact colon, were included into the study. Microbiomes from mucosal and fecal samples were analyzed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing, together with quantitative PCR of specific bacteria and archaea. RESULTS: The principal coordinates analysis clearly separated healthy tissue samples from polyps and tumors, supporting the presence of specific bacterial consortia that are associated with affected sites and that can serve as potential biomarkers of CRC progression. A higher presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Enterobacteriaceae was found by qPCR in samples from CRC compared to healthy controls. We observed a correlation between CRC process development and levels of Methanobacteriales (R = 0.537, P = 0.007) and Methanobrevibacterium (R = 0.574, P = 0.03) in fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Differences in microbial and archaeal composition between mucosal samples from healthy and disease tissues were observed in tubular adenoma and adenocarcinoma. In addition, microbiota from mucosal samples represented the underlying dysbiosis, whereas fecal samples seem not to be appropriate to detect shifts in microbial composition. CRC risk is influenced by microbial composition, showing differences according to disease progression step and tumor severity.
TI  - [Brain abscess mediated through a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia].
AB  - The patient is a 66-year-old man with hereditary telangiectasia. He was diagnosed with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM), which was revealed by contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography at the age of 65. He developed headache, right homonymous hemianopsia, and right hemiparesis and was admitted to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lesions in the left hemisphere, which indicates brain abscesses. Thus, the diagnosis of brain abscess mediated through PAVM was established. Following management with drainage and coil embolization, all neurological symptoms resolved. Therefore, coil embolization should be considered for PAVM at an early stage to prevent brain abscess, even if it is asymptomatic.
TI  - A periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.
AB  - PURPOSE: While single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vitro multispecies dental biofilm model that aimed to mimic the environment of chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Streptococcus gordonii KN1, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC23726, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC33384, and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277 were used for this experiment. The biofilms were grown on 12-well plates with a round glass slip (12 mm in diameter) with a supply of fresh medium. Four different single-species biofilms and multispecies biofilms with the four bacterial strains listed above were prepared. The biofilms were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for four different planktonic single-species and multispecies bacteria were determined. The MICs of doxycycline and chlorhexidine for four different single-species biofilms and a multispecies biofilm were also determined. RESULTS: The CLSM and SEM examination revealed that the growth pattern of the multispecies biofilm was similar to those of single-species biofilms. However, the multispecies biofilm became thicker than the single-species biofilms, and networks between bacteria were formed. The MICs of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were higher in the biofilm state than in the planktonic bacteria. The MIC of doxycycline for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, or A. actinomycetemcomitans. The MIC of chlorhexidine for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. CONCLUSIONS: To mimic the natural dental biofilm, a multispecies biofilm composed of four bacterial species was grown. The 24-hour multispecies biofilm may be useful as a laboratory dental biofilm model system.
TI  - Red wine and oenological extracts display antimicrobial effects in an oral bacteria biofilm model.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of red wine and its inherent components on oral microbiota were studied by using a 5-species biofilm model of the supragingival plaque that includes Actinomyces oris, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar. Microbiological analysis (CFU counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy) of the biofilms after the application of red wine, dealcoholized red wine, and red wine extract solutions spiked or not with grape seed and inactive dry yeast extracts showed that the solutions spiked with seed extract were effective against F. nucleatum, S. oralis and A. oris. Also, red wine and dealcoholized wine had an antimicrobial effect against F. nucleatum and S. oralis. Additional experiments showed almost complete and early degradation of flavan-3-ol precursors [(+)-catechin and procyanidin B2] when incubating biofilms with the red wine extract. To our knowledge, this is the first study of antimicrobial properties of wine in an oral biofilm model.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of a multispecies oral biofilm on different implant surfaces.
AB  - Biofilm accumulation on implant surfaces is one of the most important factors for early and late implant failure. Because of the related clinical implications, the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the bacterial cell attachment of a four-species oral biofilm on titanium discs of purity grade 2 and 4, with machined surfaces and etched-thermochemically modified with Avantblast(R). The in vitro biofilm model was composed of early (Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii), secondary (Veillonella parvula), and intermediate (Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum) colonizers of tooth surfaces. A total of 36 discs were divided into four groups: Tigr2-c (titanium grade 2, machined surface), Tigr2-t (titanium grade 2, modified surface with Avantblast(R)), Tigr4-c (titanium grade 4, machined surface), Tigr4-t (titanium grade 4, modified surface with Avantblast(R)). The experiment was repeated three times. Biofilm viability was tested with 1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution and bacterial cell quantification by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Descriptive analysis was performed to evaluate biofilm composition and differences between groups were checked with the Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05). After one week, multispecies biofilms showed a similar pattern of bacterial composition on all analyzed implant surfaces. The most prevalent bacterium was V. parvula ( approximately 50% of the total biomass), followed by S. gordonii ( approximately 30%), F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum ( approximately 10%) and A. naeslundii (<5%). Total bacterial biomass was significantly higher in both grade-4-titanium surfaces (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that not only implant surface treatment, but also titanium purity, influence early bacterial colonization.
TI  - Salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (SP) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. METHODS: Titanium discs were allocated into a control group (Ti) and an experimental group (TiN - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). The disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Stimulated, clarified, and filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. Proteome analysis of the adsorbed SP proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The surface free energy (SFE) was evaluated before and after SP formation. A multispecies biofilm composed of Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans was developed on the SP-coated discs. Viable microorganism counts were determined. The biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) with COMSTAT software. The biofilm organization was visualized by SEM. RESULTS: The surface topography was similar in both groups. The SFE of the TiN group did not differ from that of the Ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins increased the SFE in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). Different proteins were identified on the Ti and TiN surfaces. The amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of F. nucleatum and S. oralis were higher in the TiN group (p<0.001). Similar biofilms were characterized by the COMSTAT data, CLSM images, and SEM images. CONCLUSION: The titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in SP composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.
TI  - New bacterial composition in primary and persistent/secondary endodontic infections with respect to clinical and radiographic findings.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to analyze the microbiota of primary and secondary/persistent endodontic infections of patients undergoing endodontic treatment with respect to clinical and radiographic findings. METHODS: Samples from the root canals of 21 German patients were taken using 3 sequential sterile paper points. In the case of a root canal filling, gutta-percha was removed with sterile files, and samples were taken using sterile paper points. The samples were plated, and microorganisms were then isolated and identified morphologically by biochemical analysis and sequencing the 16S rRNA genes of isolated microorganisms. RESULTS: In 12 of 21 root canals, 33 different species could be isolated. Six (50%) of the cases with isolated microorganisms were primary, and 6 (50%) cases were endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth. Twelve of the isolated species were facultative anaerobic and 21 obligate anaerobic. Monomicrobial infections were found for Enterococcus faecalis and Actinomyces viscosus. E. faecalis was most frequently isolated in secondary endodontic infections (33%). Moraxella osloensis was isolated from a secondary endodontic infection that had an insufficient root canal filling accompanied by a mild sensation of pain. A new bacterial composition compromising Atopobium rimae, Anaerococcus prevotii, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Dialister invisus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum was recovered from teeth with chronic apical abscesses. CONCLUSIONS: New bacterial combinations were found and correlated to clinical and radiographic findings, particularly to chronic apical abscesses. M. osloensis was detected in root canals for the second time and only in German patients.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and head-and-neck cancer.
AB  - Interrelationships between periodontal infection and systemic conditions such as  cardiovascular disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and head-and-neck cancer have become increasingly appreciated in recent years. Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, experimentally, with measures of atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. Periodontal therapy may reduce atherosclerotic changes and improve endothelial function. Preliminary findings suggest a role for the genetic locus ANRIL in the pathobiology of both CVD and periodontitis. Periodontal pathogens induce anticardiolipin in periodontitis patients by molecular mimicry of the serum protein beta-2 glycoprotein I. These antibodies have biological and pathological activities consistent with those reported for other infection-induced antiphospholipid antibodies. Anticardiolipin may explain some of the observed associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions such as CVD and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The oral commensal Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) becomes pathogenic on migration to extra-oral sites. Fn infection of the fetal-placental unit has been linked to pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, stillbirth, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. Reagents aimed at inhibiting or resolving inflammatory responses may be used to treat or prevent pregnancy complications due to bacterial infection. Chronic periodontitis may be independently associated with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through direct toxic effects of bacteria and their products, and/or through indirect effects of inflammation. Additionally, chronic periodontitis may facilitate the acquisition and persistence of oral HPV infection, a recently emerged risk factor for HNSCC.
TI  - Combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. DESIGN: Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the Etest. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. RESULTS: Synergy, i.e. FICI values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two A. actinomycetemcomitans (FICI: 0.3), two F. nucleatum (FICI: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one E. corrodens (FICI: 0.4) isolates. Indifference, i.e. FIC indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 P. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. Microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by Etest. CONCLUSION: Combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. corrodens. Synergy was shown for a few strains only.
TI  - An endodontic-periodontal lesion with primary periodontal disease: a case report  on its bacterial profile.
AB  - The microflora in the periodontal pockets can affect the dental pulp and cause endodontic-periodontal lesions or retrograde pulpitis. Here we report an endodontic-periodontal lesion together with its bacterial profile. The lesion occurred in the maxillary right first molar of a 40-year-old woman who presented at our hospital complaining of a violent toothache since the previous night. Clinically, the tooth was caries-free and an electric pulp test showed it to be vital. The tooth showed signs of advanced periodontitis and the periodontal pocket was deep, reaching the apex of the palatal root. The clinical diagnosis was an endodontic-periodontal lesion with primary periodontal disease. Subsequent endodontic treatment comprised pulp extirpation and root canal filling, followed by periodontal treatment consisting of scaling and root planing. The tooth was finally restored with a full metal crown. No further signs of periodontal disease or periapical lesions have been observed to date. Bacteria were sampled from the root canal and periodontal pocket for a microbiological assessment using 16S rRNA gene-based PCR. Microbiologically, the profile of the bacterial species from the palatal root canal was similar to that from the periodontal pocket of the palatal root. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens were detected in both samples. The occurrence of bacteria common to both sites in this patient further supports the proposition that periodontal disease is the definitive source of root canal infections. The present results suggest that a bacterial examination would be helpful in confirming and supporting the clinical diagnosis in such lesions.
TI  - Microbial profile of root canals of primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the microbial content of root canals of human primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from 24 canals of children treated at a pediatric dentistry clinic. Microbiological identification was performed using checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 different bacteria. Data were analyzed per canal based on the mean count and frequency of each bacterial species. RESULTS: Detectable levels of bacterial species were observed for 35 probes (88%). The most frequent bacteria were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella intermedia. Facultative species were identified in 20 root canals (83%), anaerobic species were identified in 24 root canals (100%), and aerobic species in 18 root canals (75%). Black-pigmented bacilli were found in 23 samples (96%). The number of different bacterial species detected per canal ranged from five to 33. CONCLUSION: Endodontic infection in primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion is multimicrobial, including aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic micro-organisms.
TI  - [Effect of ultraviolet rays treatment of titanium and titanium alloy on antibacterial property].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial property of ultraviolet rays (UV)-treated titanium and its alloy by observing the attachment and colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus Aureus (Sa) and Fusobacterium Nucleatum (Fn). METHODS: Both of the titanium and its alloy were divided into 2 groups according to the UV treatment protocol as the UV-treated group (UV-Ti, UV-A), and two control groups (C-Ti, C-A) were also prepared. Then the sand-blasted and acid etched titanium and its alloy disks were stored in the dark and sealed containers for 4 weeks and treated with or without UV light for 48 hours. The hydrophilicity of disks were measured using contact angle measuring device. The attachment of the two kinds of bacteria were observed using inverted fluorescence microscope after stained by the Hoechst 33342 which was part of blue fluorescent dyes used to stain DNA and the results were replenished and verified by the Safranine O staining. CFU were used to measure the antibacterial property of the materials. RESULTS: The contact angles of UV-Ti (1.32 +/- 0.29) degrees and UV-A (0.89 +/- 0.07) degrees were smaller than those of C-Ti (81.18 +/- 1.46) degrees and C-A (83.34 +/- 0.06) degrees (P < 0.05). After being cultured on the surface of the two kinds of materials for 15 min, 30 min and 1 h, the attachment of Sa and Fn on the surface of titanium [(31 +/- 13, 73 +/- 13, 263 +/- 49), (10 +/- 7, 26 +/- 19, 105 +/- 37)] and its alloy disks [(64 +/- 19, 57 +/- 16, 304 +/- 53), (11 +/- 5, 59 +/- 18, 124 +/- 53)] which were treated with the UV light were much lower than those in control titanium groups[(139 +/- 30, 271 +/- 51, 749 +/- 172), (164 +/- 16, 227 +/- 65, 483 +/- 64)] and its control alloy group [(174 +/- 11, 387 +/- 39, 1409 +/- 262), (265 +/- 45, 374 +/- 133, 910 +/- 103)] (P < 0.05). What's more, the CFU number of the two kinds of bacteria decreased sharply after the UV treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: UV treatment can reduce the attachment and viability of different kinds of bacteria and the antibacterial effect will at least last for 24 hours.
TI  - Parvimonas micra as a causative organism of spondylodiscitis: a report of two cases and a literature review.
AB  - Spondylodiscitis caused by Parvimonas micra, a rarely reported infection, might be under-detected using conventional methods. This report of the detection and treatment of two cases of spondylodiscitis due to P. micra and review of the literature indicates that the use of gene sequencing methods might improve the accuracy of diagnosing this infection.
TI  - Distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. The evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. In particular, 16S rDNA-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. Here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection and osteomyelitis. The chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. Culture and DHPLC revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. The analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely Gemella morbillorum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. The diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. However, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.
TI  - Oral cavity anaerobic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method has been used to identify oral anaerobic pathogens in biofilms on voice prostheses. The purpose of the present study was to determine the location of those pathogens inside the biofilms. METHODS: Biofilms of 15 voice prostheses were sampled and used to identify the oral pathogens. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied on smears made on glass slides and on sections of intact biofilms visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) was the most frequently detected pathogen and the only tested species detected in microcolonies. The other microbes (Parvimonas micra [P. micra], Porphyromonas gingivalis [P. gingivalis], Tannerella forsythia [T. forsythia], and Treponema denticola [T. denticola]) were not detected or only detected as single cells. CLSM analysis showed that F. nucleatum resided on the biofilm surface. CONCLUSION: Although detectable, oral anaerobic pathogens seem to be no more than passers-by that adhere without further observed proliferation and apparently play no striking role in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of necrotic pulp and fistulae in primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primary teeth work as guides for the eruption of permanent dentition, contribute for the development of the jaws, chewing process, preparing food for digestion, and nutrient assimilation. Treatment of pulp necrosis in primary teeth is complex due to anatomical and physiological characteristics and high number of bacterial species present in endodontic infections. The bacterial presence alone or in association in necrotic pulp and fistula samples from primary teeth of boys and girls was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Necrotic pulp (103) and fistula (7) samples from deciduous teeth with deep caries of 110 children were evaluated. Bacterial morphotypes and species from all clinical samples were determined. RESULTS: A predominance of gram-positive cocci (81.8%) and gram-negative coccobacilli (49.1%) was observed. In 88 out of 103 pulp samples, a high prevalence of Enterococcus spp. (50%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (49%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (25%) and Prevotella nigrescens (11.4%) was observed. Porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in three out of seven fistula samples, Enterococcus spp. in two out of seven samples, and F. nucleatum, P. nigrescens and D. pneumosintes in one out of seven samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Enterococcus spp. and P. gingivalis were prevalent in necrotic pulp from deciduous teeth in boys from 2 to 5 years old, and that care of the oral cavity of children up to five years of age is important.
TI  - Massive parallel sequencing provides new perspectives on bacterial brain abscesses.
AB  - Rapid development within the field of massive parallel sequencing (MPS) is about  to bring this technology within reach for diagnostic microbiology laboratories. We wanted to explore its potential for improving diagnosis and understanding of polymicrobial infections, using bacterial brain abscesses as an example. We conducted a prospective nationwide study on bacterial brain abscesses. Fifty-two surgical samples were included over a 2-year period. The samples were categorized as either spontaneous intracerebral, spontaneous subdural, or postoperative. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified directly from the specimens and sequenced using Ion Torrent technology, with an average of 500,000 reads per sample. The results were compared to those from culture- and Sanger sequencing-based diagnostics. Compared to culture, MPS allowed for triple the number of bacterial identifications. Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedius or combinations of them were found in all spontaneous polymicrobial abscesses. F. nucleatum was systematically detected in samples with anaerobic flora. The increased detection rate for Actinomyces spp. and facultative Gram-negative rods further revealed several species associations. We suggest that A. aphrophilus, F. nucleatum, and S. intermedius are key pathogens for the establishment of spontaneous polymicrobial brain abscesses. In addition, F. nucleatum seems to be important for the development of anaerobic flora. MPS can accurately describe polymicrobial specimens when a sufficient number of reads is used to compensate for unequal species concentrations and principles are defined to discard contaminant bacterial DNA in the subsequent data analysis. This will contribute to our understanding of how different types of polymicrobial infections develop.
TI  - Signaling pathways activation by primary endodontic infectious contents and production of inflammatory mediators.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the bacterial community involved in primary endodontic diseases, evaluated its ability to activate the macrophage Toll-like receptor 4 receptor through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways, and determined the levels of endotoxins and interleukins (interleukin [IL]-6 and -10) produced by endodontic content-stimulated macrophages. METHODS: Samples were taken from 21 root canals by using sterile/apyrogenic paper points. Raw 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with root canal contents. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was used for bacterial analysis and the limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement; p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB activation was determined by Western blot analysis. IL-6 and IL-10 were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Bacteria and endotoxins were detected in 100% of the samples (21/21). The most frequently observed species were Parvimonas micra (16/21, 76%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (15/21, 71%), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (14/21, 66%). Correlations were found between endotoxins and IL-6 and IL-10 (P < .05); p38 phosphorylation had a peak at 60 minutes, and NF-kappaB was quickly activated after 10 minutes of stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the complex bacterial community was shown to be a potent activator of TLR-4 determined by the p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, culminating in a high antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of IL-6 and IL-10, all significantly affected by endotoxin levels.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. Four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection (test group 3). Samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out for Total Bacterial Count and for 10 microorganisms: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Candida albicans. The response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. The relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. Analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. Test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. Statistical significance was only reached for Treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. Test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria but only for Peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. Test groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. However, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.
TI  - Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to analyze multispecies oral biofilms.
AB  - Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) constitutes a favorable microbiological method for the analysis of spatial distribution of highly variable phenotypes found in multispecies oral biofilms. The combined use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) produces high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images of individual bacteria in their natural environment. Here, we describe the application of M-FISH on early (Streptococcus spp., Actinomyces naeslundii) and late colonizers (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella spp.) of in situ-formed oral biofilms, the acquisition of CLSM images, as well as the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these digitally obtained and processed images.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities against periodontopathic bacteria of Pittosporum tobira  and its active compound.
AB  - The study of medicinal plants for treatment of periodontitis is of great value to establish their efficacy as sources of new antimicrobial drugs. Five hundred and fifty eight Korean local plant extracts were screened for antibacterial activity against representative periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Among the various medicinal plants, the alcohol extract of Pittosporum tobira, which significantly exhibited antibacterial effect for all tested strains, showed the highest activity in the antimicrobial assays. NMR analyses revealed that R1-barrigenol, a triterpene sapogenin, was the most effective compound in P. tobira. These results demonstrated that P. tobira possesses antimicrobial properties and would be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Evaluation of the sealing capability of implants to titanium and zirconia abutments against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum under different screw torque values.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: When evaluating long-term implant success, clinicians have  always been concerned with the gap at the implant-abutment junction, where bacteria can accumulate and cause marginal bone loss. However, little information regarding bacterial leakage at the implant-abutment junction, or microgap, is available. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate sealing at 2 different implant-abutment interfaces under different screw torque values. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty sterile zirconia abutments and 20 sterile titanium abutments were screwed into 40 sterile implants and placed in test tubes. The ability of a bacterial mixture of Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum to leak through an implant-titanium abutment seal under 20 and 35 Ncm torque values and an implant-zirconia abutment seal under 20 and 35 Ncm torque values was evaluated daily until leakage was noted. Once a unit demonstrated leakage, a specimen was plated. After 4 days, the number of colonies on each plate was counted with an electronic colony counter. Plating was used to verify whether or not bacterial leakage occurred and when leakage first occurred. The implant-abutment units were removed and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline solution and evaluated with a stereomicroscope. The marginal gap between the implant and the abutment was measured and correlated with the amount of bacterial leakage. The data were analyzed with ANOVA. RESULTS: Bacterial leakage was noted in all specimens, regardless of material or screw torque value. With titanium abutments, changing the screw torque value from 20 to 35 Ncm did not significantly affect the amount of bacterial leakage. However, with zirconia abutments, changing the screw torque value from 20 to 35 Ncm was statistically significant (P<.017). Overall, the marginal gap noted was larger at the zirconia-abutment interface (5.25 +/-1.99 mum) than the titanium-abutment interface (12.38 +/-3.73 mum), irrespective of the screw torque value. Stereomicroscopy revealed a nonuniform marginal gap in all specimens. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that, over time, bacteria will leak through the implant-abutment microgap at the implant-abutment interface. Implants with a titanium abutment demonstrate a smaller microgap than implants with a zirconia abutment. Tightening the zirconia abutment screw from 20 to 35 Ncm decreases the size of the microgap, which suggests a more intimate fit between the implant and the abutment.
TI  - Acute appendicitis in children is associated with an abundance of bacteria from the phylum Fusobacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although luminal obstruction has traditionally been viewed as the underlying cause of appendicitis, recent evidence has suggested that the disease may result directly from invasion by specific pathogens, e.g. Fusobacterium nucleatum. The purpose of this study was to survey microbial communities within pediatric appendectomy specimens using a culture-independent approach. METHODS: We performed 16S ribosomal gene sequence analysis to profile the microbiota present within luminal fluid obtained from 22 pediatric appendectomy specimens. These included 10 simple appendicitis cases, 5 perforated appendicitis cases, 2 interval appendectomies, and 5 incidental appendectomies. RESULTS: Samples could be divided into 2 distinct clusters based upon the composition of the appendiceal bacterial communities. Appendicitis samples contained an increased abundance of Fusobacterium spp. and a reduced abundance of Bacteroides spp. relative to non-appendicitis cases. Appendicitis samples also contained variable amounts of other oral taxa such as Porphyromonas, Parvimonas, and Gemella, whereas these taxa were generally absent from non-appendicitis samples. CONCLUSIONS: Acute appendicitis is associated with an abundance of Fusobacterium spp. and other pathogens commonly found in the oral cavity. Further research is needed to determine whether these organisms directly cause appendicitis or rather proliferate in the appendix as a secondary consequence of inflammation.
TI  - Characterization of aid1, a novel gene involved in Fusobacterium nucleatum interspecies interactions.
AB  - The oral opportunistic pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum is known to interact with a large number of different bacterial species residing in the oral cavity. It adheres to a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including oral streptococci via the arginine-inhibitable adhesin RadD. In this study, we describe a novel protein encoded by the predicted open reading frame FN1253 that appears to play a role in interspecies interactions of F. nucleatum, particularly with oral streptococci and related Gram-positive species. We designated FN1253 as aid1 (Adherence Inducing Determinant 1). Expression analyses demonstrated that this gene was induced in F. nucleatum single species biofilms, while the presence of representative members of the oral microbiota known to adhere to F. nucleatum triggered its suppression. Inactivation as well as overexpression of aid1 affected the ability of F. nucleatum to coaggregate with oral streptococci and the closely related Enterococcus faecalis, but not other Gram-positive oral species tested. Furthermore, overexpression of aid1 led to a drastic change in the structure of dual species biofilms of F. nucleatum with oral streptococci. Aid1 function was abolished in the presence of arginine and found to be dependent on RadD. Interestingly, differential expression of aid1 did not affect messenger RNA and protein levels of RadD. These findings indicate that RadD-mediated adhesion to oral streptococci involves more complex cellular processes than the simple interaction of adhesins on the surface of partner strains. Aid1 could potentially play an important role in facilitating RadD-mediated interaction with oral streptococci by increasing binding specificity of F. nucleatum to other microbial species.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids against several oral pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of various saturated fatty acids (SFA) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) against different oral pathogens which are implicated in the cause of dental caries, stomatitis, gingivitis, and periodontitis was examined. The saturated fatty acids Pa, StA and ArA, and the unsaturated omega-7 fatty acids PLA and omega-9 fatty acids OA showed either none to low antimicrobial activity against all of the 12 oral pathogenic strains used in this study. In contrast, the omega-3 PUFAs, ALA, SDA, EPA and DHA, and the omega-6 PUFAs, LA, GLA, and AA showed considerable antimicrobial activity against 8, 7, 6 and 5 strains, and 6, 10 and 5 strains, respectively. In particular, the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs showed strong antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis KCTC 381, the cause of periodontitis, and against Aggregatibacter segnis KCTC 5968, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. Polymorphum KCTC 5172 and Prevotella intermedia KCTC 25611, all organisms implicated in the cause of gingivitis. To date, no bacterial resistance to free fatty acids has been encountered and no resistance phenotype has emerged. Therefore, these results suggest that PUFAs may be useful in the development of therapeutic agents for oral diseases, and in particular, in the development of agents that have minimal side effects and against which there is no bacterial resistance.
TI  - In vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. The role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efficacy of three oral rinses, Acclean, Noplak and Prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. Oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an MTT assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an XTT assay. RESULTS: The two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio lm-grown organisms when compared to the Prevention oral rinse. CONCLUSION: Both Acclean and Noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. In addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial recovery and viability from three different swab transport systems.
AB  - This study evaluated three types of swab transport systems for organism recovery. Swabs with transport media were further assessed for organism viability over 24 hours over a range of different storage temperatures. Test organisms consisted of aerobes, fastidious aerobes and anaerobes. Swabs were tested according to the standardised quantitative elution method published by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; M-40A). There were substantial differences in primary organism recovery, with recovery rates from different swabs ranging from <0.1% to 78% for Streptococcus pyogenes. Similar differences were noted for other test organisms. In general, the flocked swab (ESwab) demonstrated highest rates of recovery for aerobic organisms, while higher rates of recovery of Fusobacterium nucleatum were demonstrated from a standard swab (Transwab). When considering organism viability, no single swab fulfilled all the criteria stipulated by the M-40A standard for all organism/temperature combinations. Organism viability was marginally better for the gel-based swab transport systems as compared to the liquid-media based ESwab. Significant differences between swab transport systems were demonstrated, including differences for primary organism recovery and viability. The ESwab showed the best recovery of organisms, while gel-based media demonstrated marginally better bacterial viability for most tested retention times and temperatures.
TI  - Preservation of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius DNA after loss of cell viability.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether DNA from two obligate anaerobes, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, is recoverable after loss of cell viability induced by air exposure. METHODOLOGY: Harvested cultures of F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius were killed by exposure to air and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. Dead cells were incubated aerobically for up to 6 months. Every month, the presence of detectable DNA in the cell pellet and supernatant was assessed by conventional and quantitative PCR. Cell staining techniques were used to characterize the cell wall permeability of air-killed cells. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine viable, freshly killed and stored cells. RESULTS: With conventional PCR, amplifiable DNA was detectable over 6 months in all samples. Quantitative PCR showed a progressive fall in DNA concentration in nonviable cell pellets and a concomitant rise in DNA concentration in the supernatant. DNA staining showed that some air-killed cells retained an intact cell wall. After storage, SEM of both air-killed species revealed shrivelling of the cells, but some cells of P. anaerobius retained their initial form. CONCLUSION: Amplifiable DNA from F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius was detectable 6 months after loss of viability. Air-killed anaerobes initially retained their cell form, but cells gradually shriveled over time. The morphological changes were more pronounced with the gram-negative F. nucleatum than the gram-positive P. anaerobius. Over 6 months, there was a gradual increase in cell wall permeability with progressive leakage of DNA. Bacterial DNA was recoverable long after loss of cell viability.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum associates with stages of colorectal neoplasia development, colorectal cancer and disease outcome.
AB  - Commensal bacteria in the colon may play a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Recent studies from North America showed that Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) infection is over-represented in disease tissue versus matched normal tissue in CRC patients. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of DNA extracted from colorectal tissue biopsies and surgical resections of three European cohorts totalling 122 CRC patients, we found an over-abundance of Fn in cancerous compared to matched normal tissue (p < 0.0001). To determine whether Fn infection is an early event in CRC development, we assayed Fn in colorectal adenoma (CRA) tissue from 52 Irish patients. While for all CRAs the Fn level was not statistically significantly higher in disease versus normal tissue (p = 0.06), it was significantly higher for high-grade dysplasia (p = 0.015). As a secondary objective, we determined that CRC patients with low Fn levels had a significantly longer overall survival time than patients with moderate and high levels of the bacterium (p = 0.008). The investigation of Fn as a potential non-invasive biomarker for CRC screening showed that, while Fn was more abundant in stool samples from CRC patients compared to adenomas or controls, the levels in stool did not correlate with cancer or adenoma tissue levels from the same individuals. This is the first study examining Fn in the colonic tissue and stool of European CRC and CRA patients, and suggests Fn as a novel risk factor for disease progression from adenoma to cancer, possibly affecting patient survival outcomes. Our results highlight the potential of Fn detection as a diagnostic and prognostic determinant in CRC patients.
TI  - Effect of estradiol on planktonic growth, coaggregation, and biofilm formation of the Prevotella intermedia group bacteria.
AB  - Alterations in the quantity and quality of biofilms at gingival margin are considered to play a role in the initiation and development of pregnancy-related gingivitis. Prevotella intermedia sensu lato is able to consume estradiol, the major sex hormone secreted during pregnancy, in the absence of vitamin K. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of estradiol on the planktonic growth, coaggregation, polysaccharide production, and biofilm formation of the P. intermedia group bacteria, namely P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella pallens. In all experiments, the type strain (ATCC) and a clinical strain (AHN) of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. pallens were incubated with the concentrations of 0, 30, 90, and 120 nmol/L of estradiol. Planktonic growth was assessed by means of the colony forming unit method, while coaggregation and biofilm formation were assessed by spectrophotometric methods. In the determination of protein and polysaccharide levels, the Bradford and phenol-sulfuric acid methods were used, respectively. P. pallens AHN 9283 and P. nigrescens ATCC 33563 increased their numbers at planktonic stage with increasing estradiol concentrations. In 48-h biofilm tests, elevated protein levels were found for both strains of P. intermedia, and the strains P. nigrescens ATCC 33563 and P. pallens AHN 9283 in the presence of estradiol. The P. intermedia strains also increased the levels of polysaccharide formation in the biofilm. Coaggregation of the P. intermedia group organisms with Fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced only in P. intermedia AHN 8290. In conclusion, our in vitro experiments indicate that estradiol regulates planktonic growth, coaggregation, polysaccharide production, and biofilm formation characteristics of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. pallens differently. These results may, at least partly, explain the differences seen in their contribution to the pathogenesis of pregnancy-related gingivitis.
TI  - Effect of bacteria on the wound healing behavior of oral epithelial cells.
AB  - Wounded tissue offers opportunity to microflora to adhere, colonize, invade and infect surrounding healthy tissue. The bacteria of the oral cavity have the potential to alter the wound healing process by interacting with keratinocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms through which oral bacteria may influence re-epithelialization by interacting with gingival keratinocytes. By an in vitro scratch assay we demonstrate that primary gingival keratinocytes have impaired closure when exposed to two well characterized oral bacteria, P. gingivalis, and to a lesser extent, F. nucleatum. P. gingivalis reduced wound closure by approximately 40%, which was partially dependent on proteolytic activity, and bacteria was still present within infected cells 9 days later despite exposure to bacteria for only 24 h. Both oral bacteria caused keratinocyte apoptosis at the wound site with cell death being greatest at the wound edge. P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum adversely affected cell proliferation and the effect also had a spatial component being most striking at the edge. The impact of the bacteria was long lasting even when exposure was brief. Cell migration was compromised in bacteria challenged keratinocytes with P. gingivalis having more severe effect (p<0.05) than F. nucleatum. Quantitative real time PCR of bacteria challenged cells showed that P. gingivalis and to a lesser extent F. nucleatum significantly downregulated cell cycle genes cyclin1, CDK1, and CDK4 (p<0.05) that are critical for GI/S transition. Further, genes associated with cell migration such as integrin beta-3 and -6 were significantly downregulated by P. gingivalis (p<0.05).
TI  - Coinfection of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces israelii in mastoiditis diagnosed by next-generation DNA sequencing.
AB  - Some bacterial infections involve potentially complex mixtures of species that can now be distinguished using next-generation DNA sequencing. We present a case of mastoiditis where Gram stain, culture, and molecular diagnosis were nondiagnostic or discrepant. Next-generation sequencing implicated coinfection of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces israelii, resolving these diagnostic discrepancies.
TI  - Diverse Toll-like receptors mediate cytokine production by Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in macrophages.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate a repertoire of immune responses in macrophages against various pathogens. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are two important periodontal pathogens. In the present study, we investigated TLR signaling regulating cytokine production of macrophages in response to F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans. TLR2 and TLR4 are redundant in the production of cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) in F. nucleatum- and A. actinomycetemcomitans-infected macrophages. The production of cytokines by macrophages in response to F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans infection was impaired in MyD88-deficient macrophages. Moreover, cytokine concentrations were lower in MyD88-deficient macrophages than in TLR2/TLR4 (TLR2/4) double-deficient cells. An endosomal TLR inhibitor, chloroquine, reduced cytokine production in TLR2/4-deficient macrophages in response to F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans, and DNA from F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans induced IL-6 production in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), which was abolished by chloroquine. Western blot analysis revealed that TLR2/4 and MyD88 were required for optimal activation of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in macrophages in response to F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans, with different kinetics. An inhibitor assay showed that NF-kappaB and all MAPKs (p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK], and Jun N-terminal protein kinase [JNK]) mediate F. nucleatum-induced production of cytokines in macrophages, whereas NF-kappaB and p38, but not ERK and JNK, are involved in A. actinomycetemcomitans-mediated cytokine production. These findings suggest that multiple TLRs may participate in the cytokine production of macrophages against periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus salivarius WB21--containing tablets for the treatment of oral malodor: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of probiotic intervention using lactobacilli on oral malodor. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a 14-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial of tablets containing Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 (2.0 x 10(9) colony-forming units per day) or placebo taken orally by patients with oral malodor. RESULTS: Organoleptic test scores significantly decreased in both the probiotic and placebo periods compared with the respective baseline scores (P < .001 and P = .002), and no difference was detected between periods. In contrast, the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) (P = .019) and the average probing pocket depth (P = .001) decreased significantly in the probiotic period compared with the placebo period. Bacterial quantitative analysis found significantly lower levels of ubiquitous bacteria (P = .003) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (P = .020) in the probiotic period. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that daily oral consumption of tablets containing probiotic lactobacilli could help to control oral malodor and malodor-related factors.
TI  - Biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (PDS II(R)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (MET) or ciprofloxacin (CIP) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibrous matrices were processed from PDS polymer solution by electrospinning. Antibiotic-containing PDS solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% MET, 25 wt.% MET, 5 wt.% CIP, and 25 wt.% CIP. Pure PDS was used as a control. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done to evaluate MET and CIP release. Dual-species biofilms formed by Lactobacillus casei (Lc) and Streptococcus salivarius (Ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. After 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. Additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) using agar diffusion assay. RESULTS: A three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. Pure PDS showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% MET (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% MET (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% CIP (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% CIP (765 +/- 288 nm). HPLC demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. No inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. Meanwhile, CIP-containing matrices inhibited growth of Fn and Aa. CONCLUSION: CIP-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.
TI  - Genome Sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum Strain W1481, a Possible New Subspecies Isolated from a Periodontal Pocket.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a bacterial species commonly detected in dental plaque within the human oral cavity, with some strains associated with periodontal disease, one of the most common clinical bacterial infections in the human body. The exact mechanisms of its pathogenesis are still not completely understood. In this study, we present the genome sequence and annotation of F. nucleatum strain W1481, isolated from a periodontal pocket of a dental patient at the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of which showed it to be markedly different from the five previously named subspecies.
TI  - Inhibition of glutamate racemase by substrate-product analogues.
AB  - D-Glutamate is an essential biosynthetic building block of the peptidoglycans that encapsulate the bacterial cell wall. Glutamate racemase catalyzes the reversible formation of D-glutamate from L-glutamate and, hence, the enzyme is a potential therapeutic target. We show that the novel cyclic substrate-product analogue (R,S)-1-hydroxy-1-oxo-4-amino-4-carboxyphosphorinane is a modest, partial noncompetitive inhibitor of glutamate racemase from Fusobacterium nucleatum (FnGR), a pathogen responsible, in part, for periodontal disease and colorectal cancer (Ki=3.1+/-0.6 mM, cf. Km=1.41+/-0.06 mM). The cyclic substrate-product analogue (R,S)-4-amino-4-carboxy-1,1-dioxotetrahydro-thiopyran was a weak inhibitor, giving only approximately 30% inhibition at a concentration of 40 mM. The related cyclic substrate-product analogue 1,1-dioxo-tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one was a cooperative mixed-type inhibitor of FnGR (Ki=18.4+/-1.2 mM), while linear analogues were only weak inhibitors of the enzyme. For glutamate racemase, mimicking the structure of both enantiomeric substrates (substrate-product analogues) serves as a useful design strategy for developing inhibitors. The new cyclic compounds developed in the present study may serve as potential lead compounds for further development.
TI  - Transcriptional responses of Treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  - The classic organization by Socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. Socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes. While the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. In this study, we employed T. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (P. gingivalis and T. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using F. nucleatum and P. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using Streptococcus sanguinis and S. gordonii as representatives). RNA was extracted from T. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. Numerous genes related to motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in T. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. Further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. Most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, Msp, CTLP) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. In summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Short-chain fatty acids from periodontal pathogens suppress histone deacetylases, EZH2, and SUV39H1 to promote Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus replication.
AB  - Periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum produce five different short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as metabolic by-products. We detect significantly higher levels of SCFAs in the saliva of patients with severe periodontal disease. The different SCFAs stimulate lytic gene expression of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) dose dependently and synergistically. SCFAs inhibit class-1/2 histone deacetylases (HDACs) and downregulate expression of silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1). SCFAs also downregulate expression of enhancer of zeste homolog2 (EZH2) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog1 (SUV39H1), which are two histone N-lysine methyltransferases (HLMTs). By suppressing the different components of host epigenetic regulatory machinery, SCFAs increase histone acetylation and decrease repressive histone trimethylations to transactivate the viral chromatin. These new findings provide mechanistic support that SCFAs from periodontal pathogens stimulate KSHV replication and infection in the oral cavity and are potential risk factors for development of oral Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). IMPORTANCE: About 20% of KS patients develop KS lesions first in the oral cavity, while other patients never develop oral KS. It is not known if the oral microenvironment plays a role in oral KS tumor development. In this work, we demonstrate that a group of metabolic by-products, namely, short-chain fatty acids, from bacteria that cause periodontal disease promote lytic replication of KSHV, the etiological agent associated with KS. These new findings provide mechanistic support that periodontal pathogens create a unique microenvironment in the oral cavity that contributes to KSHV replication and development of oral KS.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of sword bean extract on alveolar bone resorption induced in rats by Porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The domesticated legume, Canavalia gladiata (commonly called the sword bean), is known to contain canavanine. The fruit is used in Chinese and Japanese herbal medicine for treating the discharge of pus, but its pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of sword bean extract (SBE) on (i) oral bacteria and human oral epithelial cells in vitro, and (ii) the initiation and progression of experimental Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced alveolar bone resorption in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet method was applied to quantitate canavanine in SBE. By assessing oral bacterial growth, we estimated the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of SBE, canavanine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) solution. The cytotoxicity of SBE, canavanine, CHX, leupeptin and cystatin for KB cells was determined using a trypan blue assay. The effects of SBE, canavanine, leupeptin and cystatin on Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp) were evaluated by colorimetric assay using synthetic substrates. To examine its effects on P. gingivalis-associated periodontal tissue breakdown, SBE was orally administered to P. gingivalis-infected rats. RESULT: Sword bean extract contained 6.4% canavanine. SBE and canavanine inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The cytotoxicity of SBE, canavanine and cystatin on KB cells was significantly lower than that of CHX. Inhibition of Rgp with SBE was comparable to that with leupeptin, a known Rgp inhibitor, and inhibition of Kgp with SBE was significantly higher than that with leupeptin at 500 mug/mL ( p < 0.05). P. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone resorption was significantly suppressed by administration of SBE, with bone levels remaining comparable to non-infected animals ( p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that SBE might be effective against P. gingivalis-associated alveolar bone resorption.
TI  - In vitro growth characteristics and volatile sulfur compound production of Solobacterium moorei.
AB  - Solobacterium moorei has recently been implicated as a causative agent of halitosis. In vitro experiments to evaluate the role of S. moorei in halitosis have, however, been complicated by a paucity of information on the ideal conditions for culturing this organism. This work aimed to optimize a liquid culture medium for S. moorei, and to determine the growth-curve of the organism. Further, the ability of S. moorei to generate volatile sulfur compounds was investigated and compared quantitatively to other oral anaerobes by an optimized head-space gas chromatography method. Serum-supplementation of standard liquid growth media gave greater growth of S. moorei than non-supplemented broths, with the best medium found to be serum-supplemented tryptone soya broth. S. moorei was able to metabolize cysteine directly to hydrogen sulfide, but was unable to produce methanethiol from methionine. S. moorei produced 2-3 times more hydrogen sulfide (normalized for colony forming units) than Porphyromonas gingivalis and Veillonella dispar, but considerably less than Fusobacterium nucleatum. The study has identified reliable growth conditions for culture of S. moorei, which were employed to show that S. moorei has the requisite biochemistry consistent with a potential role in halitosis.
TI  - Prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. Although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. In this study, we examined the synergic effects of Prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. The synergic effects of the supernatant of P. intermedia (PiSup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (A549) cells by PiSup was assessed. The effects of PiSup on platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. Mice inoculated with S. pneumoniae plus PiSup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without PiSup. In A549 cells, PiSup increased pneumococcal adhesion and PAFR transcript levels. PiSup also increased lung PAFR transcript levels in mice. Similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Thus, P. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine O on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. In this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may play a crucial part in the future. The aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency of aPDT using the photosensitizer safranine O with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% CHX) on an ex vivo biofilm. METHODS: First the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 33399, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 33384 and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 was observed. Then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. The antibacterial effects of aPDT and of 0.2% CHX were determined on the ex vivo biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. After cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). RESULTS: Photodynamic treatment with safranine O showed a distinct antibacterial effect on F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. Whereas S. gordonii was suppressed completely by aPDT, treatment with 0.2% CHX caused only a partial reduction. In the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), aPDT caused a significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% CHX. Compared to the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by aPDT with safranine O. Especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% CHX. Both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.
TI  - Meningitis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum after a kart crash.

TI  - Fusobacterium spondylodiscitis: case report and literature review.
AB  - Fusobacteria are obligate anaerobic bacilli residing in the oral cavity, female genital tract, and intestine. These pathogens are typical components of head, neck, and abdominal abscesses due to contiguous spread from adjacent mucosal surfaces. They are unusual etiologies, however, of bone and joint infections, particularly outside the cranial region. We report an unusual case of hematogenous lumbar spondylodiscitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum of suspected odontogenic origin.
TI  - Preservation of bacterial DNA by human dentin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The capacity of dentin and collagen to bind DNA and protect against spontaneous and nuclease-induced degradation was evaluated individually and by the incubation of DNA with nuclease-producing bacteria in a mixed culture. METHODS: Extracted Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA was incubated with dentin shavings or collagen for 90 minutes. The DNA-bound substrates were incubated in different media (water, sera, and DNase I) for up to 3 months. Amplifiable DNA was released from dentin using EDTA,or from collagen using proteinase K, and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The stability of dentin-bound DNA was also assessed in a mixed culture (Parvimonas micra and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus) containing a DNase-producing species, Prevotella intermedia. Samples were analyzed for amplifiable DNA. RESULTS: In water, dentin-bound DNA was recoverable by PCR at 3 months compared with no detectable DNA after 4 weeks in controls (no dentin). DNA bound to collagen was detectable by PCR after 3 months of incubation in water. In 10% human sera, amplifiable DNA was detectable at 3 months when dentin bound and in controls (no dentin). In mixed bacterial culture, dentin-bound DNA was recoverable throughout the experimental period (3 months), compared with no recoverable F. nucleatum DNA within 24 hours in controls (no dentin). CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong binding affinity between DNA and dentin, and between DNA and serum proteins or collagen. These substrates preserve DNA against natural decomposition and protect DNA from nuclease activity, factors that may confound molecular analysis of the endodontic microbiota yet favor paleomicrobiological studies of ancient DNA.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequences of Fusobacterium nucleatum ChDC F145, ChDC F174, ChDC F206, and ChDC F300, Isolated from Human Subgingival Plaques in the Republic of Korea.
AB  - Recently, five strains were isolated from human subgingival plaques and were proposed as a novel subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Here, we report the draft genome sequences of the strains, except one for which the draft sequence was already introduced.
TI  - In vitro activity of Carvacrol against titanium-adherent oral biofilms and planktonic cultures.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the effect of Carvacrol against oral pathogens and their preformed biofilms on titanium disc surface. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) were performed to evaluate Carvacrol antibacterial activity, while flow cytometry (FCM) was used to verify the Carvacrol effect on esterase activity and membrane permeability. Carvacrol was tested in vitro on single- and multi-species biofilms formed on titanium disc by Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 or Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, in different combinations, comparing its effect to that of chlorhexidine. RESULTS: The pathogens were sensitive to Carvacrol with MICs and MBCs values of 0.25 % and 0.50 % and BICs of 0.5 % for S. mutans ATCC 25175 and 1 % for P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. FCM analysis showed that treatment of planktonic cultures with Carvacrol caused an increase of damaged cells and a decrement of bacteria with active esterase activity. Moreover, Carvacrol demonstrated greater biofilm formation preventive property compared to chlorhexidine against titanium-adherent single- and multi-specie biofilms, with statistically significant values. CONCLUSIONS: Carvacrol showed inhibitory activity against the tested oral pathogens and biofilm formation preventive property on their oral biofilm; then, it could be utilized to control and prevent the colonization of microorganisms with particular significance in human oral diseases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This natural compound may be proposed in daily hygiene formulations or as an alternative agent supporting traditional antimicrobial protocols to prevent periodontal diseases in implanted patients.
TI  - Co-occurrence of anaerobic bacteria in colorectal carcinomas.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous cancers have been linked to microorganisms. Given that colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and the colon is continuously exposed to a high diversity of microbes, the relationship between gut mucosal microbiome and colorectal cancer needs to be explored. Metagenomic studies have shown an association between Fusobacterium species and colorectal carcinoma. Here, we have extended these studies with deeper sequencing of a much larger number (n = 130) of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal control tissues. We analyzed these data using co-occurrence networks in order to identify microbe-microbe and host-microbe associations specific to tumors. RESULTS: We confirmed tumor over-representation of Fusobacterium species and observed significant co-occurrence within individual tumors of Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia and Campylobacter species. This polymicrobial signature was associated with over-expression of numerous host genes, including the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory chemokine Interleukin-8. The tumor-associated bacteria we have identified are all Gram-negative anaerobes, recognized previously as constituents of the oral microbiome, which are capable of causing infection. We isolated a novel strain of Campylobacter showae from a colorectal tumor specimen. This strain is substantially diverged from a previously sequenced oral Campylobacter showae isolate, carries potential virulence genes, and aggregates with a previously isolated tumor strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum. CONCLUSIONS: A polymicrobial signature of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria is associated with colorectal carcinoma tissue.
TI  - Radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. Lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). A risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. Overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). An increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella (P.) oralis, P. buccae, P. oris, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus (Strep.) anginosus group. An increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for Strep. salivarius, Strep. parasanguis, Strep. anginosus group, Capnocytophaga spp., Neisseria (N.) sicca, Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus, P. intermedia, P. buccae, Prevotella spp. and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSIONS: The radiography-based score suggests that certain Prevotella spp., F. nucleatum and Strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, Neisseria spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Staph. aureus and Prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.
TI  - Effects of tongue cleaning on bacterial flora in tongue coating and dental plaque: a crossover study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of tongue cleaning on reconstruction of bacterial flora in dental plaque and tongue coating itself are obscure. We assessed changes in the amounts of total bacteria as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum in tongue coating and dental plaque specimens obtained with and without tongue cleaning. METHODS: We conducted a randomized examiner-blind crossover study using 30 volunteers (average 23.7 +/- 3.2 years old) without periodontitis. After dividing randomly into 2 groups, 1 group was instructed to clean the tongue, while the other did not. On days 1 (baseline), 3, and 10, tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected after recording tongue coating score (Winkel tongue coating index: WTCI). After a washout period of 3 weeks, the same examinations were performed with the subjects allocated to the alternate group. Genomic DNA was purified from the samples and applied to SYBR(R) Green-based real-time PCR to quantify the amounts of total bacteria and F. nucleatum. RESULTS: After 3 days, the WTCI score recovered to baseline, though the amount of total bacteria in tongue coating was significantly lower as compared to the baseline. In plaque samples, the bacterial amounts on day 3 and 10 were significantly lower than the baseline with and without tongue cleaning. Principal component analysis showed that variations of bacterial amounts in the tongue coating and dental plaque samples were independent from each other. Furthermore, we found a strong association between amounts of total bacteria and F. nucleatum in specimens both. CONCLUSIONS: Tongue cleaning reduced the amount of bacteria in tongue coating. However, the cleaning had no obvious contribution to inhibit dental plaque formation. Furthermore, recovery of the total bacterial amount induced an increase in F. nucleatum in both tongue coating and dental plaque. Thus, it is recommended that tongue cleaning and tooth brushing should both be performed for promoting oral health.
TI  - Detection of fusobacterium nucleatum and fadA adhesin gene in patients with orthodontic gingivitis and non-orthodontic periodontal inflammation.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is one of the most abundant gram-negative bacilli colonizing the subgingival plaque and closely associated with periodontal disease. However it is unclear whether F. nucleatum is involved in gingival inflammation under orthodontic appliance. A novel adhesin, FadA, which is unique to oral Fusobacteria, is required for F. nucleatum binding and invasion to epithelial cells and thus may play an important role in colonization of Fusobacterium in the host. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of F. nucleatum and its virulence factor FadA adhesion gene (fadA) in 169 subgingival biofilm samples from 55 cases of gingivitis patients with orthodontic appliances, 49 cases of gingivitis patients without orthodontic treatment, 35 cases of periodontitis patients and 30 cases of periodontally healthy people via PCR. The correlations between the F. nucleatum/fadA and gingivitis index(GI)was also analyzed. The detection rate of F. nucleatum/fadA in periodontitis group and non-orthodontic gingivitis group was higher than the other two groups (p<0.01) while it was higher in orthodontic gingivitis group than in health people (p<0.05). An obviously positive correlation was observed between the prevalence of F. nucleatum/fadA and GI. F. nucleatum carrying fadA may be more closely related to the development of gingivitis and periodontal disease compared with orthodontic gingivitis.
TI  - Antibacterial and antigelatinolytic effects of Satureja hortensis L. essential oil on epithelial cells exposed to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The present report examined the effects of essential oils (EOs) from Satureja hortensis L. and Salvia fruticosa M. on the viability and outer membrane permeability of the periodontopathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum, a key bacteria in oral biofilms, as well as the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activities in epithelial cells exposed to such bacteria. Membrane permeability was tested by measuring the N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine uptake and bacterial viability by using the commercially available Live/Dead BacLight kit. In addition, gelatin zymography was performed to analyze the inhibition of F. nucleatum-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in HaCaT cells. We showed that 5, 10, and 25 muL/mL of Sat. hortensis L. EO decreased the ratio of live/dead bacteria and increased the outer membrane permeability in a range of time from 0 to 5 min. Treatments with 10 and 25 muL/mL of Sal. fruticosa M. also increased the membrane permeability and 5, 10, and 25 muL/mL of both EOs inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in keratinocytes induced after exposure of 24 h to F. nucleatum. We conclude that antibacterial and antigelatinolytic activities of Sat. hortensis L. EO have potential for the treatment of periodontal inflammation.
TI  - Periodontal bacteria in the genital tract: are they related to adverse pregnancy  outcome?
AB  - One of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (PTB) is acute genitourinary tract infection. The bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include Gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low birth weight. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(Fn), and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations. The more representative oral pathogen (less than 60 percent) species in oral samples of preterm and term group were Tf, Td, and Fn. 24.4 percent of pregnant women presented periodontal pathogens in vaginal swab; the most representative species with a percentage over 0.1 percent of total bacteria in genital tract of preterm group were Tf, Td, and Piwith a positive correlation (less than 0.5). The presence of the bacterium T. denticolain the vagina, regardless of the amount, adversely affects preterm delivery.
TI  - The effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer on the production of reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species and cytokines by two macrophage subtypes.
AB  - AIM: To test the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer (MTA Fillapex((R))) and MTA (MTA-Angelus((R))) on viability and on the production of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (NO) by M1 and M2 inflammatory macrophages. METHODOLOGY: M1 (from C57BL/6 mice) and M2 (from BALB/c mice) peritoneal inflammatory macrophages were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of original and diluted extracts of MTA and MTA Fillapex (FLPX). The cell viability, ROS release and the release of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10 and NO in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. The data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Fillapex was cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (1:1;1:2) and decreased the viability (P < 0.05) of both macrophage types (<20%). MTA did not interfere with cellular viability. FLPX inhibited the release of ROS and decreased NO release in F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius -stimulated M1 and M2 macrophages (</=25 mu mol L(-1)). F. nucleatum-stimulated M2 macrophage cultures released lower levels of TNF-alpha when FLPX was added (</=1 ng mL(-1)). M2 macrophages released higher (>5 ng mL(-1)) levels of IL-10 than M1 macrophages. Only M1 macrophage cultures produced IL-12p70. CONCLUSIONS: Fillapex impaired effector immune responses during inflammation (M1 macrophages), as well as during healing (M2 macrophages) responses.
TI  - Phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  - The effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. Eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. Light with a power density of 70 mW/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. Dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. Microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard DNA probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. The proportions of black-pigmented species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. Five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. These species were Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena. At the same time, the percentage of gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. No adverse effects were found or reported in this study. The present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - The effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study. Each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. All patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. Plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. RESULTS: Plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. The greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. Post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum, while Campylobacter rectus, Parvimonas micra, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.
TI  - Impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. The model included Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomycesoris, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Based on literature, we considered Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. We quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative PCR and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. The biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. However, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. In the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. Moreover, besides a significant increase of P. intermedia and a decrease of P. gingivalis , P. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. A. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. Hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on P. intermedia and P. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. Streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence P. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. animalis ChDC F324, Isolated from a Human Subgingival Plaque in the Republic of Korea.
AB  - Five subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum have been classified: animalis, nucleatum, polymorphum, vincentii, and fusiforme. F. nucleatum subsp. animalis ChDC F324 (KCOM 1325) was isolated from a human subgingival plaque in the Republic of Korea. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of the strain.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ChDC F316, Isolated from a Human Peri-implantitis Lesion in the Republic of Korea.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe and is one of the causative agents of periodontal diseases, including peri-implantitis. Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ChDC F316 (KCOM 1322) was isolated from a human peri-implantitis lesion. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of this strain.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii ChDC F8, Isolated from a Human Subgingival Plaque in the Republic of Korea.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, obligately anaerobic rod bacterium which might play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontal diseases. F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii ChDC F8 (KCOM 1231) was isolated from a human gingivitis lesion. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of the strain.
TI  - Dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  - AIM: We aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (BS) and non-discoloured plaque. METHODS: Forty-six children with BS and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. Dental caries was scored using WHO criteria. Samples of BS and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. The DNA of the samples was extracted and real-time PCR was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus sp., Actinomyces naeslundii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. RESULTS: Children with BS had lower DMFT (p = 0.013), lower DT values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. Plaque samples of the BS group contained higher numbers of A. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of F. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. Comparing the children with BS and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for A. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with BS while in caries-affected children with BS, lower counts of F. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. Counts of Lactobacillus sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in BS of caries-free and caries-affected children. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the different microbial composition of BS might be associated with the lower caries experience in affected subjects. The role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum activates the immune response through retinoic acid-inducible gene I.
AB  - Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor involved in the sensing of RNA viruses and the initiation of antiviral responses. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium associated with periodontal disease, is capable of invading cells. We hypothesized that F. nucleatum's ability to invade cells allows the microorganism to activate the immune response through RIG-I. Bacterial invasion was found to be necessary for F. nucleatum-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. Following invasion of the human periodontal ligament fibroblast (PDLF), F. nucleatum was located in the cytosol. F. nucleatum infection led to an 80-fold increase in RIG-I expression. Silencing RIG-I in PDLF by siRNA led to a significant decrease of NF-kappaB activation and expression of proinflammatory genes. Additionally, F. nucleatum was able to secrete nucleic acids, and introduction of F. nucleatum RNA into PDLF led to a RIG-I-dependent activation of NF-kappaB. Our findings showed RIG-I to be involved in the recognition of F. nucleatum. The function of RIG-I is likely to be broad and not limited to sensing of viruses only. Hence, this receptor may play an important role in detecting invasive forms of oral pathogens and contribute to inflammation in periodontal tissues.
TI  - Fusobacterium species infections: clinical spectrum and outcomes at a district general hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Fusobacterium species infections are rare. Recently, however, this potentially deadly pathogen has been attracting interest, and efforts are being made to characterise its epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease. The aim of our study is to provide further evidence towards this cause, in what is, to date, the largest study of its kind from the UK. METHOD: A 22-year, retrospective, descriptive study was performed at Royal Hampshire County Hospital. An electronic database was used to identify patients with microbiologically confirmed infection with Fusobacterium, and clinical records were examined to provide further information on the presentation, source, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Fusobacterium species infections were identified in 18 patients during the study period, which is an incidence of 0.76 cases/100,000/year. The overall death rate was 29 %. Half of these patients had Fusobacterium necrophorum infections and were a predominantly young, fit and uniquely male population who had excellent outcomes. Among the remaining patients with Fusobacterium species infections, 22 % had infection with F. varium and 11 % with F. nucleatum. These patients were an older cohort who tended to have co-morbidities and unsurprisingly worse outcomes. We identified a number of Fusobacterium bacteraemias likely to have resulted from pressure ulcers, a presentation that has been rarely reported. Interestingly, we also identified a case of neonatal F. nucleatum bacteraemia that was not associated with premature nor stillborn birth. CONCLUSION: As work continues to depict the spectrum of disease caused by this enigmatic bacterium, it is hoped that improved clinical suspicion will result in better outcomes and management.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16S rDNA gene sequence.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16S rDNA gene sequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. In both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. An anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. The bacterial strains were identified by 16S rDNA genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. RESULTS: Peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. A total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. The predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were Eubacterium nodatum, E. brachy, E. saphenum, Filifactor alocis, Slackia exigua, Parascardovia denticolens, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Centipeda periodontii, and Parvimonas micra. The predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from Streptococcus were Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Veillonella species, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces species, Propionibacterium acnes, and Parvimonas micra. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. The present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (AAGPRs) such as E. nodatum, E. brachy, E. saphenum, Filifactor alocis, Slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that AAGPRs may also play an important role.
TI  - Association of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria in postmenopausal females.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous findings of an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and periodontal disease may be partially explained by the antimicrobial properties of vitamin D. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has investigated the association between 25(OH)D and pathogenic oral bacteria, a putative cause of periodontal disease. METHODS: The association between plasma 25(OH)D concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria was examined among postmenopausal females in the Buffalo Osteoporosis and Periodontal Disease Study (1997 to 2000), an ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. Subgingival plaque samples were assessed using immunofluorescence for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Campylobacter rectus. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalent bacteria by quintile (Q) of 25(OH)D concentrations, adjusting for age and body mass index. RESULTS: Of the 855 participants, 288 (34%) had deficient/inadequate (<50 nmol/L) 25(OH)D concentrations, and 496 (58%) had at least one species of pathogenic bacteria. No significant association was found between 25(OH)D and presence of any of these bacteria (adjusted OR for high [Q5] compared to low [Q1] 25(OH)D = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.50; P for trend = 0.50). Inverse, although not statistically significant, associations were found between 25(OH)D and more than one species of pathogenic bacteria (adjusted OR for adequate compared to deficient/inadequate 25(OH)D = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.19). CONCLUSIONS: No association was observed between pathogenic oral bacteria and 25(OH)D concentrations in postmenopausal females. This may be attributable to the species of bacteria assessed, small effect size, or a true absence of an association.
TI  - Anaerobic co-culture of mesenchymal stem cells and anaerobic pathogens - a new in vitro model system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are multipotent by nature and are originally isolated from bone marrow. In light of a future application of hMSCs in the oral cavity, a body compartment with varying oxygen partial pressures and an omnipresence of different bacterial species i.e. periodontitis pathogens, we performed this study to gain information about the behavior of hMSC in an anaerobic system and the response in interaction with oral bacterial pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established a model system with oral pathogenic bacterial species and eukaryotic cells cultured in anaerobic conditions. The facultative anaerobe bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were studied. Their effects on hMSCs and primary as well as permanent gingival epithelial cells (Ca9-22, HGPEC) were comparatively analyzed. We show that hMSCs cope with anoxic conditions, since 40% vital cells remain after 72 h of anaerobic culture. The Ca9-22 and HGPEC cells are significantly more sensitive to lack of oxygen. All bacterial species reveal a comparatively low adherence to and internalization into hMSCs (0.2% and 0.01% of the initial inoculum, respectively). In comparison, the Ca9-22 and HGPEC cells present better targets for bacterial adherence and internalization. The production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 is higher in both gingival epithelial cell lines compared to hMSCs and Fusobacterium nucleatum induce a time-dependent cytokine secretion in both cell lines. Porphyromonas gingivalis is less effective in stimulating secretion of IL-8 in the co-cultivation experiments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HMSCs are suitable for use in anoxic regions of the oral cavity. The interaction with local pathogenic bacteria does not result in massive pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. The test system established in this study allowed further investigation of parameters prior to set up of oral hMSC in vivo studies.
TI  - Effect of controlled-release Periochip on clinical and microbiological parameters in patients of chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of Periochip as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) with SRP alone in patients with chronic periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, split mouth, 3-month clinical and microbiological trial included 30 sites in 15 patients aged 30-50 years diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. In each patient, two bilateral pockets probing 5-7 mm were randomly assigned to test and control groups. The test group received SRP plus Periochip, whereas the control group received SRP alone. Clinical indices and anaerobic culture analysis was done at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months interval. Total bacterial count and analysis of four major periodontopathogenic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) was done. RESULTS: Significant improvement was obtained in all clinical variables in the test group as compared to the control group over the study period. Total colony counts were significantly reduced in the test group as compared to control over the period of time. At baseline Aa was recovered from 4 test group sites and 5 control group sites, Pg from 15 test group and 14 control group sites, Pi from 5 test group and 2 control group sites, Fn from 7 test and 7 control group sites. At 3 months, Aa was recovered from 1 test group and 4 control group sites, Pg from 4 test group and 8 control group sites, Pi from 1 test group and 1 control group site, Fn from 3 test and 4 control group sites. CONCLUSION: Periochip placement as an adjunct to SRP, showed promising results, when compared to SRP alone. Healthy microflora can be maintained for a longer period of time and delay in the repopulation by periodontopathic microorganisms was observed.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effects of Lactobacillus reuteri probiotics in the treatment of chronic periodontitis: a randomized placebo-controlled study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty chronic periodontitis patients were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after therapy. All patients received one-stage full-mouth disinfection and randomly assigned over a test (SRP + probiotic, n = 15) or control (SRP + placebo, n = 15) group. The lozenges were used two times a day for 12 weeks. RESULTS: At week 12, all clinical parameters were significantly reduced in both groups, while there was significantly more pocket depth reduction (p < 0.05) and attachment gain (p < 0.05) in moderate and deep pockets; more Porphyromonas gingivalis reduction was observed in the SRP + probiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that oral administration of L. reuteri lozenges could be a useful adjunct to SRP in chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic efficiency of novel cationic porphyrins towards periodontal Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The Gram-negative Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum are major causative agents of aggressive periodontal disease. Due to increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy (aPDT) seems to be a plausible alternative. In this work, photosensitization was performed on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in pure culture using new-age cationic porphyrins, namely mesoimidazolium-substituted porphyrin derivative (ImP) and pyridinium-substituted porphyrin derivative (PyP). The photophysical properties of both the sensitizers including absorption, fluorescence emission, quantum yields of the triplet excited states and singlet oxygen generation efficiencies were evaluated in the context of aPDT application. The studied porphyrins exhibited high ability to accumulate into bacterial cells with complete penetration into early stage biofilms. As compared with ImP, PyP was found to be more effective for photoinactivation of bacterial strains associated with periodontitis, without any signs of dark toxicity, owing to its high photocytotoxicity.
TI  - Cetylpyridinium chloride suppresses gene expression associated with halitosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Halitosis is a common complaint affecting the majority of the population. Mouthrinses containing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) have been used as oral hygiene aids to suppress oral malodor. Although the clinical efficacy of these mouthrinses has been well-documented, the mechanism whereby CPC reduces malodor is less-well-understood. We hypothesized that CPC suppresses expression of the genes (mgl and cdl) and enzymes responsible for methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production by oral anaerobes associated with halitosis. In this study, the mgl and cdl expression of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in the presence of CPC was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a microdilution method to determine the growth and production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) by P. gingivalis W83 and F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 in respective media containing CPC (0.5 mug/mL to 1.5 mug/mL). For metabolic activity, we used an XTT {2,3-bis(2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide} reduction assay. We used real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting to evaluate the effect of CPC at sub-MIC levels on mgl and cdl expression at the transcriptional and enzymatic levels. RESULTS: CPC inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum at MICs of 3 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, and at MBCs of 6 mug/mL and 3 mug/mL, respectively. Compared with untreated controls, CPC at 1.5 mug/mL suppressed CH3SH production of P. gingivalis by 69.84%+/-2.88% and H2S production of F. nucleatum by 82.55%+/-8.36% (p<0.05) without affecting metabolic activity. Inhibition of mgl mRNA (81.58%+/-20.33%) and protein (39.15%+/-6.65%) expression in P. gingivalis and inhibition of cdl mRNA (61.76%+/-13.75%) and protein (64.34%+/-1.62%) expression in F. nucleatum were also noted (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: CPC represents an effective agent for halitosis reduction by inhibiting the growth and suppressing the expression of specific genes related to VSC production in anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Differential effect of autoinducer 2 of Fusobacterium nucleatum on oral streptococci.
AB  - Autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is a quorum sensing molecule and plays an important role in  dental biofilm formation, mediating interspecies communication and virulence expression of oral bacteria. Fusobacterium nucleatum connects early colonizing commensals and late colonizing periodontopathogens. F. nucleatum AI-2 and quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) can manipulate dental biofilm formation. In this study, we evaluated the effect of F. nucleatum AI-2 and QSIs on biofilm formation of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis, which are initial colonizers in dental biofilm. F. nucleatum AI-2 significantly enhanced biofilm growth of S. gordonii and attachment of F. nucleatum to preformed S. gordonii biofilms. By contrast, F. nucleatum AI-2 reduced biofilm growth of S. oralis and attachment of F. nucleatum to preformed S. oralis biofilms. The QSIs, (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5H)-furanone and d-ribose, reversed the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of AI-2 on S. gordonii and S. oralis, respectively. In addition, co-culture using a two-compartment system showed that secreted molecules of F. nucleatum had the same effect on biofilm growth of the streptococci as AI-2. Our results demonstrate that early colonizing bacteria can influence the accretion of F. nucleatum, a secondary colonizer, which ultimately influences the binding of periodontopathogens.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum induces cytokine production through Toll-like-receptor-independent mechanism.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether Fusobacterium nucleatum's ability to invade cells allows the bacteria to activate pro-inflammatory response through cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, independent of surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs). METHODOLOGY: HEK293T cells, which lack endogenous TLRs, and overexpressing dominant negative myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88DN) protein, were infected with F. nucleatum and the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was determined. The necessity for intracellular invasion of the bacteria for cytokine production was also investigated by blocking bacterial invasion with cytochalasin D. The roles of NFkB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-1 (NOD-1) signalling pathways in F. nucleatum-induced IL-8 secretion were determined. RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum-infected HEK293T cells produced IL-8 independent of the MYD88 signalling. This response was inhibited by preventing F. nucleatum invasion into HEK293T cells. p38 MAPK but not the NFkB signalling pathway was required for F. nucleatum-mediated IL-8 production. HEK293T cells expressed NOD-1 but not NOD-2. Yet, inhibition of NOD-1 signalling did not affect F. nucleatum-induced IL-8 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Fusobacterium nucleatum invasion led to cytokine production, which is mediated by the p38 MAPK signalling but independent of TLRs, NOD-1, NOD-2 and NFkB signalling.
TI  - Oral community interactions of Filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  - Filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. In the oral cavity F. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between F. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. Here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of F. alocis with Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. In an in vitro community development model, S. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of F. alocis into a dual species community. In contrast, F. nucleatum and the type strain of F. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. Accumulation of a low passage isolate of F. alocis was also enhanced by F. nucleatum. In three species communities of S. gordonii, F. nucleatum and F. alocis, the antagonistic effects of S. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of F. nucleatum toward F. alocis. The interaction between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. alocis was strain specific and A. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate F. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. P. gingivalis and F. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of P. gingivalis greater than in the absence of F. alocis. However, while P. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of F. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to F. alocis alone. The inhibitory effect of P. gingivalis toward F. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the Mfa1 fimbrial subunit. In addition, AI-2 production by P. gingivalis helped maintain levels of F. alocis. Collectively, these results show that the pattern of F. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in F. nucleatum.
TI  - Myocardial infection due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, which inhabits the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. Infections classically affect the head and neck. We report a patient with a myocardial mass due to F. nucleatum, initially thought to be a neoplasm, and discuss anaerobic cardiac infections.
TI  - A chlorhexidine-loaded biodegradable cellulosic device for periodontal pockets treatment.
AB  - Absorbent points widely used in endodontic therapy were transformed into bioresorbable chlorhexidine delivery systems for the treatment of the periodontal pocket by preventing its recolonization by the subgingival microflora. These paper points (PPs) were first oxidized to promote their resorption, then grafted with beta-cyclodextrin (CD) or maltodextrin (MD) in order to achieve sustained delivery of chlorhexidine. We investigated the oxidation step parameters through the time of reaction and the nitric and phosphoric acid ratios in the oxidizing mixture, and then the dextrin grafting step parameters through the time and temperature of reaction. A first selection of the appropriate functionalization parameters was undertaken in relation to the degradation profile kinetics of the oxidized (PPO) and oxidized-grafted samples (PPO-CD and PPO-MD). Samples were then loaded with chlorhexidine digluconate (digCHX), a widely used antiseptic agent in periodontal therapy. The release kinetics of digCHX from PPO-CD and PPO-MD samples were compared to PP, PPO and to PerioChip((R)) (a commercial digCHX containing gelatine chip) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The cytocompatibility of the oxidized-grafted PP was demonstrated by cell proliferation assays. Finally, the disc diffusion test from digCHX loaded PPO-MD samples immersed in human plasma was developed on pre-inoculated agar plates with four common periodontal pathogenic strains: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Aggregatibacter actinomycetem comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. To conclude, the optimized oxidized-dextrin-grafted PPs responded to our initial specifications in terms of resorption and digCHX release rates and therefore could be adopted as a reliable complementary periodontal therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - Salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in Fanconi's anemia patients.
AB  - Fanconi's anemia (FA) is characterized by bone marrow failure and can lead to infections such as periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of four periodontopathic bacteria including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola in saliva samples from children with and without FA. Paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 71 children and adolescents, aged 6-18 years old. The samples were divided in three groups: FA without HSCT (n = 25), FA with HSCT (n = 23) and Non-FA (n = 24). The test bacteria were identified using a 16S rRNA-based PCR analysis. P. gingivalis was the most frequent species in all groups and T. denticola the less frequent. P. gingivalis was also common species in combinations in all groups. No statistically difference was observed between the groups for single bacteria, pair or triple combination. The combination of the four species was detected in one saliva sample of the FA without HSCT group and in five samples of the Non-FA group, with statistical difference between them (p < 0.05, Fisher exact test). Systemic alterations found in FA subjects did not affect the salivary distribution of the four bacteria analyzed.
TI  - DNA-based adaptive immunity protect host from infection-associated periodontal bone resorption via recognition of Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence component.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is one of a constellation of oral organisms associated with human chronic periodontitis. While adaptive immunity to periodontal pathogen proteins has been investigated and is an important component of periodontal bone resorption, the effect of periodontal pathogen DNA in eliciting systemic and mucosal antibody and modulating immune responses has not been investigated. METHODS: Rowett rats were locally injected with whole genomic Pg DNA in alum. Escherichia coli (Ec) genomic DNA, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) genomic DNA, and saline/alum injected rats served as controls. After various time points, serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody to Ec, Fn or Pg were detected by ELISA. Serum and salivary antibody reactions with Pg surface antigens were determined by Western blot analyses and the specific antigen was identified by mass spectrometry. Effects of genomic DNA immunization on Pg bacterial colonization and experimental periodontal bone resorption were also evaluated. RESULTS: Sera from Pg DNA, Ec DNA and Fn DNA-injected rats did not react with Ec or Fn bacteria. Serum IgG antibody levels to Pg and Pg surface extracts were significantly higher in animals immunized with Pg DNA as compared to the control groups. Rats injected with Pg DNA demonstrated a strong serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody reaction solely to Pg fimbrillin (41kDa), the major protein component of Pg fimbriae. In the Pg DNA-immunized group, the numbers of Pg bacteria in oral cavity and the extent of periodontal bone resorption were significantly reduced after Pg infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that infected hosts may select specific genes from whole genomic DNA of the periodontal pathogen for transcription and presentation. The results indicate that the unique gene selected can initiate a host protective immune response to the parent bacterium.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of geriatric subjects.
AB  - PURPOSE: At present, information regarding periodontal disease in geriatric patients is scarce. The purpose of this study was to quantify the periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of Korean geriatric patients and assess the relationship between the bacterial levels and the periodontal condition. METHODS: Six putative periodontal pathogens were quantified by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in geriatric patient groups (>60 years) with mild chronic periodontitis (MCP), moderate chronic periodontitis (MoCP), and severe chronic periodontitis (SCP). The copy numbers of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia were measured. RESULTS: It was found that the bacterial copy numbers increased as the severity of the disease increased from MCP to SCP, except for P. intermedia. For P. intermedia, it was found that samples in the MCP group yielded the largest amount. It was also found that the quantities of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola, the so-called "red complex" bacteria, were lower than those of F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. intermedia in all of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results of this study suggest that the levels of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, F. nucleatum, and T. denticola present in saliva are associated with the severity of periodontal disease in geriatric patients.
TI  - The effects of stress hormones on growth of selected periodontitis related bacteria.
AB  - The focus of this study was to examine in vitro the effects of stress hormones (catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and hydrocortisone: cortisol) on the growth of four anaerobic species of periodontitis-related bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythia) and one facultative anaerobic species (Eikenella corrodens). Bacterial growth was determined by two different methods: fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the viable count by culture method. To simulate stress, each single strain was grown in a special growth medium with three different concentrations of each hormone, using an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees C. Growth of F. nucleatum increased in the presence of all stress hormones. Growth of P. gingivalis was not significantly influenced by any hormone. Growth of P. intermedia and E. corrodens was inhibited by almost all stress hormones tested. Both methods of analysis revealed that the highest concentrations of norepinephrine and cortisol increased the growth of T. forsythia. Different hormones have a different effect on the growth of periodontitis-related bacteria in vitro. It appears that bacterial viability is more strongly influenced than is bacterial metabolic activity. The growth of F. nucleatum particularly and partially of T. forsythia is increased by several stress hormones and may have an additional negative impact on periodontal disease.
TI  - Fusobacterium spp. and colorectal cancer: cause or consequence?
AB  - Although increasing evidence suggests a relationship between bacterial dysbiosis  and colorectal cancer (CRC), few studies have identified specific microbial etiologic factors. Recent studies have implicated overabundance of Fusobacterium in association with colorectal adenomas and cancer. Two articles published in Cell Host & Microbe provide insights into the Fusobacterium-CRC relationship.
TI  - Progression of periodontal inflammation in adolescents is associated with increased number of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the change of related subgingival periodontopathogens among different stage of gingivitis in adolescent and assess the relationship between periodontopathogens and the progression of periodontal inflammation. METHODS: A total of 77 subgingival plaque samples from 35 adolescent individuals were divided into three groups including gingivitis group (mild, 15 samples; moderate, 16 samples; severe, 15 samples), chronic periodontitis group (15 samples) and healthy group (15 samples). Real-time PCR was used to quantitate Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in subgingival plaque samples. RESULTS: All species, except for F. nucleatum, were detected in samples from gingivitis and periodontitis groups in significantly greater number than in those from healthy group (P < 0.05). In gingivitis groups, the number of P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and F. nucleatum in moderate and severe gingivitis groups was significantly higher than in mild gingivitis group (P < 0.05). After merging moderate gingivitis and severe gingivitis groups into moderate-to-severe gingivitis group, the four periodontopathogens were detected in samples from periodontitis group in significantly greater number than in those from moderate-to-severe gingivitis group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The number of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, T. forsythensis, and F. nucleatum in subgingival plaque increases with progression of periodontal inflammation in adolescents. Examination of periodontopathogens number in adolescents may be of some value for monitoring of periodontal disease development.
TI  - Efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  - AIM: To assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (BOMP)]. After retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, BOMP and stain indexes), a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (CPC mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. Subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were included in the analysis. At 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). At 6 months, the mean BOMP values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). Changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and BOMP (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. A microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for Prevotella intermedia. CONCLUSION: The evaluated 0.07% CPC-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to the placebo, for at least 6 months.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Recurrent lung infection due to chronic peri-odontitis.
AB  - Association between chronic lung disease and peri-odontal infection has recently  been reported. The microbiology of peri-odontal infection and lung infection is almost similar. The most direct means by which the oral infection might influence lung disease is by aspiration of dental plaque bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. In this case report we are presenting a patient who suffered recurrent lung infection. Intra-oral examination revealed the presence of chronic peri-odontitis, which was not treated before. On providing treatment for lung infection in addition to that for peri-odontal infection, there was no recurrence of lung infection.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis promotes invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma through induction of proMMP9 and its activation.
AB  - Recent epidemiological studies have revealed a significant association between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is implicated in the invasion and metastasis of tumour cells. We examined the involvement of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, in OSCC invasion through induced expression of proMMP and its activation. proMMP9 was continuously secreted from carcinoma SAS cells, while P. gingivalis infection increased proenzyme expression and subsequently processed it to active MMP9 in culture supernatant, which enhanced cellular invasion. In contrast, Fusobacterium nucleatum, another periodontal organism, failed to demonstrate such activities. The effects of P. gingivalis were observed with highly invasive cells, but not with the low invasivetype. P. gingivalis also stimulated proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and enhanced proMMP9 expression, which promoted cellular invasion. P. gingivalis mutants deficient in gingipain proteases failed to activate MMP9. Infected SAS cells exhibited activation of ERK1/2, p38, and NF-kB, and their inhibitors diminished both proMMP9-overexpression and cellular invasion. Together, our results show that P. gingivalis activates the ERK1/2-Ets1, p38/HSP27, and PAR2/NF-kB pathways to induce proMMP9 expression, after which the proenzyme is activated by gingipains to promote cellular invasion of OSCC cell lines. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of progression and metastasis of OSCC associated with periodontitis.
TI  - [Evaluation on antimicrobial efficacy of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant: an in vitro study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant and Bingpeng irrigant on four endodontic pathogen bacteria. METHODS: The agar dilution method was used to observe the antimicrobial activity of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant, Bingpeng irrigant against four selected endodontic pathogen bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Enterococcus faecalis). Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration was examined. RESULTS: Two irrigants had the antimicrobial activity against the anaerobic microorganisms. The antimicrobial efficacy of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant was better than that of Bingpeng irrigant. Compared with others, Enterococcus faecalis had the strongest resistance. CONCLUSION: Fufang Bingpeng irrigant has good antibacterial activity. As a root canal irrigant, Chinese medicine alteratives might be advantageous.
TI  - Preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. This study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. RESULTS: All DNA samples were positive for 16S rRNA gene PCR. One hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. In addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum (8/11), Dialister (D.) invisus (8/11), Campylobacter (C.) gracilis (7/11), Escherichia (E.) coli DH1 (6/11), Aggregatibacter (A.) segnis (6/11), and Streptococcus (S.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. Furthermore, 45 as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. F. nucleatum, D. invisus, C. gracilis, E. coli DH1, A. segnis, and S. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16S rRNA sequencing.
TI  - Bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  - Current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. This study used 454-pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 region of 16S rRNA genes (approximately 500 bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. A total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. Plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. In addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. All of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. Pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per sample. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. Changes in the relative abundance of OTUs during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (BoP) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. Comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. Taxa associated with gingivitis included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Lachnospiraceae [G-2] sp. HOT100, Lautropia sp. HOTA94, and Prevotella oulorum, whilst Rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. Further study of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent periodontal disease.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum potentiates intestinal tumorigenesis and modulates the tumor-immune microenvironment.
AB  - Increasing evidence links the gut microbiota with colorectal cancer. Metagenomic  analyses indicate that symbiotic Fusobacterium spp. are associated with human colorectal carcinoma, but whether this is an indirect or causal link remains unclear. We find that Fusobacterium spp. are enriched in human colonic adenomas relative to surrounding tissues and in stool samples from colorectal adenoma and carcinoma patients compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, in the Apc(Min/+) mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis, Fusobacterium nucleatum increases tumor multiplicity and selectively recruits tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, which can promote tumor progression. Tumors from Apc(Min/+) mice exposed to F. nucleatum exhibit a proinflammatory expression signature that is shared with human fusobacteria-positive colorectal carcinomas. However, unlike other bacteria linked to colorectal carcinoma, F. nucleatum does not exacerbate colitis, enteritis, or inflammation-associated intestinal carcinogenesis. Collectively, these data suggest that, through recruitment of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, fusobacteria generate a proinflammatory microenvironment that is conducive for colorectal neoplasia progression.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by modulating E-cadherin/beta-catenin signaling via its FadA adhesin.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but causality and underlying mechanisms remain to be established. We demonstrate that Fn adheres to, invades, and induces oncogenic and inflammatory responses to stimulate growth of CRC cells through its unique FadA adhesin. FadA binds to E-cadherin, activates beta-catenin signaling, and differentially regulates the inflammatory and oncogenic responses. The FadA-binding site on E-cadherin is mapped to an 11-amino-acid region. A synthetic peptide derived from this region of E-cadherin abolishes FadA-induced CRC cell growth and oncogenic and inflammatory responses. The fadA gene levels in the colon tissue from patients with adenomas and adenocarcinomas are >10-100 times higher compared to normal individuals. The increased FadA expression in CRC correlates with increased expression of oncogenic and inflammatory genes. This study unveils a mechanism by which Fn can drive CRC and identifies FadA as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for CRC.
TI  - Characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. The present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant Lactobacillus species detected. Saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. Saliva was cultured and Lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Five L. gasseri isolates that differed in 16S rRNA sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. Oral swab samples were analyzed by qPCR for Lactobacillus gasseri. RESULTS: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) fraction (47 out of 90). Lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the MFGM supplemented formula-fed infants. L. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of Lactobacillus positive infants) of six Lactobacillus species detected. L. gasseri isolates inhibited Streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, and inhibited growth of S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. L. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and MUC7, and purified MFGM, and adhered to epithelial cells. L. gasseri was detected by qPCR in 29.7% of the oral swabs. Breastfed infants had significantly higher mean DNA levels of L. gasseri (2.14 pg/uL) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/uL) or MFGM (0.697 pg/uL) formula. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. The dominant Lactobacillus was L. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.
TI  - Genotype is an important determinant factor of host susceptibility to periodontitis in the Collaborative Cross and inbred mouse populations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal infection (Periodontitis) is a chronic inflammatory disease, which results in the breakdown of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that resistance to chronic periodontitis is controlled to some extent by genetic factors of the host. The aim of this study was to determine the phenotypic response of inbred and Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse populations to periodontal bacterial challenge, using an experimental periodontitis model. In this model, mice are co-infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterial strains associated with human periodontal disease. Six weeks following the infection, the maxillary jaws were harvested and analyzed for alveolar bone loss relative to uninfected controls, using computerized microtomography (microCT). Initially, four commercial inbred mouse strains were examined to calibrate the procedure and test for gender effects. Subsequently, we applied the same protocol to 23 lines (at inbreeding generations 10-18) from the newly developed mouse genetic reference population, the Collaborative Cross (CC) to determine heritability and genetic variation of control bone volume prior to infection (CBV, naive bone volume around the teeth of uninfected mice), and residual bone volume (RBV, bone volume after infection) and loss of bone volume (LBV, the difference between CBV and RBV) following infection. RESULTS: BALB/CJ mice were highly susceptible (P<0.05) whereas DBA/2J, C57BL/6J and A/J mice were resistant. Six lines of the tested CC population were susceptible, whereas the remaining lines were resistant to alveolar bone loss. Gender effects on bone volume were tested across the four inbred and 23 CC lines, and found not to be significant. Based on ANOVA analyses, broad-sense heritabilities were statistically significant and equal to 0.4 for CBV and 0.2 for LBV. CONCLUSIONS: The moderate heritability values indicate that the variation in host susceptibility to the disease is controlled to an appreciable extent by genetic factors. These results strongly support the possibility of using the Collaborative Cross, as well as developing dedicated F2 (resistant x susceptible inbred strains) resource populations, for future dissection of genetic factors in periodontitis.
TI  - Multi-centre evaluation of mass spectrometric identification of anaerobic bacteria using the VITEK(R) MS system.
AB  - Accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. Classic phenotypic methods for identification require long turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification of anaerobes. We present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance of the VITEK((R)) MS in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. Five different test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. Multiple species were included for several of the genera. Briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. Matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. Mass spectra results were generated with the VITEK((R)) MS, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the VITEK((R)) MS database 2.0. Results were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. An additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. Genus-level identification consisted of Actinomyces, Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces neuii and Bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other anaerobes tested. VITEK((R)) MS identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.
TI  - A transfer efficiency model for ultrasound mediated drug/gene transferring into cells.
AB  - Ultrasound is a very promising technology to mediated drug/gene transferring into cells. However the relations between cell experimental conditions and results have been still unknown. It seriously impeded the development of the technology. In the article, a transfer efficiency model for ultrasound mediated drug/gene transferring into cells in stable cavitation was constructed. To testify the model, the numerical results were compared with the cell experimental data from six literatures in the entirely different experimental conditions. The numerical results fit the cell experimental data well. Despite simplifications and limitations, the model for the first time established the relationship between the cell experimental results about transfer efficiency and the conditions including ultrasound, microbubble and cells in stable cavitation.
TI  - Oral Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum binds to human salivary alpha-amylase.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum acts as an intermediate between early and late colonizers in the oral cavity. In this study, we showed that F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum can bind to a salivary component with a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa and identified the protein and another major factor of 55 kDa, as salivary alpha-amylase by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and immuno-reactions. Salivary alpha-amylase is present in both monomeric and dimeric forms and we found that formation of the dimer depends on copper ions. The F. nucleatum adhered to both monomeric and dimeric salivary alpha-amylases, but the numbers of bacteria bound to the dimeric form were more than those bound to the monomeric form. The degree of adherence of F. nucleatum to four alpha-amylases from different sources was almost the same, however its binding to beta-amylase was considerably decreased. Among four alpha-amylase inhibitors tested, acarbose and type 1 and 3 inhibitors derived from wheat flour showed significant activity against the adhesion of F.nucleatum to monomeric and dimeric amylases, however voglibose had little effect. Moreover F. nucleatum cells inhibited the enzymatic activity of salivary alpha-amylase in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that F. nucleatum plays more important and positive role as an early colonizer for maturation of oral microbial colonization.
TI  - A periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola hijacks the Fusobacterium nucleatum-driven host response.
AB  - Periodontitis is a polymicrobial disease that arises from the dysbiosis of the plaque biofilm. To study polymicrobial interactions with gingival epithelial cells, the oral commensal Fusobacterium nucleatum and the periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola were chosen due to their opposing effects on the expression of human beta-defensins (HBDs) and interleukin (IL)-8 in gingival epithelial cells. Immortalized gingival epithelial HOK-16B cells were infected with either F. nucleatum or T. denticola alone or together, and the expression of HBDs and IL-8 was investigated. Coinfection with F. nucleatum and T. denticola neutralized the stimulatory and suppressive effects on the expression of HBD-2 and -3, but the suppressive effect of T. denticola on IL-8 expression remained. In CHO/CD14/TLR2 reporter cells, T. denticola attenuated F. nucleatum-induced activation of TLR2, a receptor that mediates HBD induction. Although F. nucleatum facilitated the invasion of T. denticola into host cells, T. denticola interfered with the fusion of internalized F. nucleatum with lysosomes, which may avert TLR9-dependent IL-8 induction. Furthermore, T. denticola suppressed the F. nucleatum-stimulated accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of essential signaling molecules for the TLR2 and TLR9 pathways. The elimination of ROS using N-acetyl cysteine completely blocked the inductions of HBD-3 and IL-8 and significantly reduced HBD-2 induction by F. nucleatum, confirming the importance of ROS in the host response. In sum, T. denticola incapacitates the F. nucleatum-induced expression of HBDs and IL-8 in gingival epithelial cells by interrupting endo-lysosomal maturation and ROS-dependent TLR activation. These results may provide new insights into polymicrobial interactions in the gingival sulcus.
TI  - Photodynamic biofilm inactivation by SAPYR--an exclusive singlet oxygen photosensitizer.
AB  - Prevention and control of biofilm-growing microorganisms are serious problems in  public health due to increasing resistances of some pathogens against antimicrobial drugs and the potential of these microorganisms to cause severe infections in patients. Therefore, alternative approaches that are capable of killing pathogens are needed to supplement standard treatment modalities. One alternative is the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB). The lethal effect of PIB is based on the principle that visible light activates a photosensitizer, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species, e.g., singlet oxygen, which induces phototoxicity immediately during illumination. SAPYR is a new generation of photosensitizers. Based on a 7-perinaphthenone structure, it shows a singlet oxygen quantum yield PhiDelta of 99% and is water soluble and photostable. Moreover, it contains a positive charge for good adherence to cell walls of pathogens. In this study, the PIB properties of SAPYR were investigated against monospecies and polyspecies biofilms formed in vitro by oral key pathogens. SAPYR showed a dual mechanism of action against biofilms: (I) it disrupts the structure of the biofilm even without illumination; (II) when irradiated, it inactivates bacteria in a polymicrobial biofilm after one single treatment with an efficacy of >/= 99.99%. These results encourage further investigation on the potential of PIB using SAPYR for the treatment of localized infectious diseases.
TI  - Relationship between halitosis and periodontal disease - associated oral bacteria in tongue coatings.
AB  - AIM: The objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between halitosis and oral bacteria in tongue coating (TC) and saliva samples from patients with halitosis, and to evaluate the effect of tongue cleaning on halitosis. METHODS: Ninety-four participants complaining of oral malodour were included in the study. Organoleptic (OR) values, volatile sulphur compound (VSC) concentrations determined by gas chromatography and TC scores were used as clinical parameters of halitosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to determine the numbers of periodontal disease-associated oral bacteria. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between TC scores and OR values, methylmercaptan (CH3 SH) concentrations and VSC concentrations (Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient test, P < 0.01). There was also a positive correlation between the clinical parameters of halitosis and total bacterial numbers and Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus concentrations in the TC samples. However, there was no similar correlation with respect to the saliva samples. The participants were sub-divided into two groups based on whether they had the habit of tongue cleaning or not. The participants with the habit of tongue cleaning had significantly lower OR scores, VSC concentrations and P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and C. rectus levels than the other participants (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggested that periodontal disease-associated oral bacteria in TCs are closely related to halitosis and that tongue cleaning may be an effective method for improving halitosis.
TI  - Endobronchial lesion due to pulmonary Fusobacterium nucleatum infection in a child.
AB  - Clinically significant infections due to the members of the genus Fusobacterium are rare. The clinical manifestations of pulmonary Fusobacterium nucleatum infections range from simple aspiration pneumonia to severe diseases as necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema. Endobronchial lesions and obstructions are rarely seen in children and are often a misdiagnosed result in delay of definitive treatment. Here, we report a case of endobronchial lesion due to pulmonary F. nucleatum infection in an entirely healthy child before illness. This is the first case reported in the literature of endobronchial lesion due to pulmonary F. nucleatum infection.
TI  - Halitosis vaccines targeting FomA, a biofilm-bridging protein of fusobacteria nucleatum.
AB  - Halitosis (bad breath) is estimated to influence more than half of the world's population with varying degree of intensity. More than 85% of halitosis originates from oral bacterial infections. Foul-smelling breath mainly results from bacterial production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. To date, major treatments for elimination of oral malodor include periodontal therapy combined with antibiotics or antimicrobial agents, and mechanical approaches including tooth and tongue cleaning. These treatments may transiently reduce VSCs but carry risks of generating toxicity, increasing resistant strains and misbalancing the resident human flora. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative therapeutic modalities for halitosis. Plaque biofilms are the principal source for generating VSCs which are originally metabolized from amino acids during co-aggregation of oral bacteria. Blocking the bacterial coaggregation, therefore, may prevent various biofilm-associated oral diseases such as periodontitis and halitosis. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), a Gram-negative anaerobe oral bacterium, is a main bacterial strain related to halitosis. Aggregation of F. nucleatum with other bacteria to form plaque biofilms in oral cavity causes bad breath. FomA, the major outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum, recruits other oral pathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in the periodontal pockets. A halitosis vaccine targeting F. bacterium FomA significantly abrogates the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms, production of VSCs, and gum inflammation mediated by an inter-species interaction of F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, which suggests FomA of F. nucleatum to be a potential target for development of vaccines or drugs against bacterial biofilm formation and its associated pathogenicities.
TI  - Microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by Sanger sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty subjects were assigned to a Control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a Test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). In the Test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. In both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16S rRNA sequences. RESULTS: The phylogenetic identity of 1387 16S rRNA gene clones was determined. Healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of Actinomyces, Atopobium, Gemella, Kingella and Rothia and lower levels of Campylobacter, Desulfobulbus, Dialister, Eubacterium, Filifactor, Mitsukella, Porphyromonas and Pseudoramibacter (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). Fusobacterium nucleatum, Dialister invisus, Streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (HOT) 064, Filifactor alocis and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while Veillonella dispar, Actinomyces meyeri, Granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the Control and Test groups (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. The biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as F. alocis, D. invisus and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131.
TI  - Effects of C-reactive protein on the neutrophil respiratory burst in vitro.
AB  - This study determined the influence of physiologically relevant concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by neutrophils. Neutrophils from healthy individuals were incubated with soluble pentameric CRP prior to TLR stimulation with Fusobacterium nucleatum, or FcgammaR stimulation with IgG-opsonised Staphylococcus aureus or heat-aggregated IgG. ROS generation by unstimulated cells and those after stimulation were determined using luminol, isoluminol and lucigenin chemiluminescence, detecting predominantly intracellular hypochlorous acid (HOCl), extracellular hydrogen peroxide (detected as HOCl) and extracellular superoxide respectively. Baseline (unstimulated) neutrophil ROS generation and release was reduced compared with vehicle control by 10 microg/ml CRP. There was no consistent effect of CRP on FcgammaR-stimulated HOCl production, but the extracellular superoxide response was reduced by 10 microg/ml CRP. By contrast, CRP reduced intracellular (10 microg/ml) and extracellular (3 and 10 microg/ml) HOCl generation, but increased superoxide release (1-10 microg/ml) in response to TLR stimulation. Physiologically relevant concentrations of CRP inhibited baseline ROS generation and reduced FcgammaR-stimulated extracellular superoxide and TLR-stimulated HOCl release, suggesting that CRP may offer some degree of host protection from neutrophil-associated, low-level oxidative stress. However, CRP enhanced TLR-mediated superoxide release from neutrophils, potentially increasing oxidative stress but aiding host protection from infection.
TI  - Oral microbial colonization in laryngectomized patients as a possible cofactor of biofilm formation on their voice prostheses.
AB  - AIM: Biofilm formation on voice prostheses, which are used for voice rehabilitation in laryngectomized patients, is a main cause of device failure. The aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of periodontal pathogens in the biofilm on voice prostheses is related to that in the oral cavity and associated with the periodontal status of the patients. METHODS: Thirty-one laryngectomized patients were invited to participate, 13 of whom met exclusion criteria. The remaining 18 were classified according to the community periodontal index of treatment needs (community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN), grades 0-4). Biofilm samples from the oral cavity and voice prostheses were analysed by PCR-based hybridization for 11 pathogens. RESULTS: All dentate patients required periodontal treatment (CPITN-3: n = 4, CPITN-4: n = 8); the remaining six were edentulous. The diversity (i.e. number of bacterial species detected) of pathogens detected on the voice prostheses correlated significantly positively with the diversity of pathogens in the oral cavity and with clinical parameters. Furthermore, the diversity of pathogens differed significantly between dentate and edentulous patients. CONCLUSIONS: Results emphasize the oral cavity as an important source of bacteria for biofilm formation on voice prostheses. Whether these pathogens reduce the lifetime of the device by increased biofilm formation and/or increase the risk of silicone deterioration requires further study.
TI  - A new type of Na(+)-driven ATP synthase membrane rotor with a two-carboxylate ion-coupling motif.
AB  - The anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na(+). Here, we demonstrate that this ion-motive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis, via an F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase with a novel Na(+) recognition motif, shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate Na(+) specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed Na(+) stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the Na(+) ionophore monensin. Furthermore, Na(+) has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na(+) coupling is provided by two identical crystal structures of the c(1)(1) ring, solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 A resolution, at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Na(+) ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. Intriguingly, two carboxylates instead of one mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that this motif implies that a proton is concurrently bound to all sites, although Na(+) alone drives the rotary mechanism. The structure thus reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases and provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.
TI  - Characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular fluid flow conditions. The aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. Biofilms were established using a modified Robbins device on hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs. Three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, Live/Dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). Finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (CHX+NaF) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (CHX+CPC)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in our 4-d biofilm model. RESULTS: The viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. The architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the HAP. The effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. Moreover, it was observed that in 4-d biofilm formed in vitro, CHX+CPC caused significantly higher mortality compared with CHX (p = 0.003) and CHX+NaF (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. It also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.
TI  - Evaluation of the host response in various models of induced periodontal disease  in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to characterize and evaluate the host response caused by three different models of experimental periodontitis in mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 wild-type female mice were distributed into six experimental groups and sacrificed at 7, 15, and 30 days after the induction of periodontal disease: 1) group C: no treatment control group; 2) group L: periodontal disease induced by ligature; 3) group G-Pg: oral gavage with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg); 4) group G-PgFn: oral gavage with Fusobacterium nucleatum + Pg; 5) group I-Pg: heat-killed Pg injected into the palatal mucosa between the molars; and 6) group I-V: phosphate-buffered saline injected into the palatal mucosa. The samples were used to analyze the immune-inflammatory process in the gingival tissue via descriptive histologic and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. The alveolar bone loss was evaluated using microcomputed tomography. The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a post hoc Dunn test and analysis of variance, followed by a Tukey test using a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Only the ligature model displayed significant alveolar bone loss in the initial period (7 days), which was maintained with time. The group injected with heat-killed Pg displayed significant alveolar bone loss starting from day 15, which continued to progress with time (P <0.05). A significant increase (P <0.05) in the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and -1beta) and proteins involved in osteoclastogenesis (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand and osteoprotegerin) was observed in the ligature group on day 7. CONCLUSION: The ligature and injection of heat-killed Pg models were the most representative of periodontal disease in humans, whereas the oral gavage models were not effective at inducing the disease under the experimental conditions.
TI  - Comparison of epigenetic profiles of human oral epithelial cells from HIV-positive (on HAART) and HIV-negative subjects.
AB  - HIV-infected subjects on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are susceptible to comorbid microbial infections in the oral cavity. We observed that primary oral epithelial cells (POECs) isolated from HIV+ subjects on HAART grow more slowly and are less innate immune responsive to microbial challenge when compared with POECs from normal subjects. These aberrant cells also demonstrate epigenetic differences that include reduction in histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC-1) levels and reduced total DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity specific to enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3A. The DNMT activity correlates well with global DNA methylation, indicating that aberrant DNMT activity in HIV+ (on HAART) POECs leads to an aberrantly methylated epithelial cell phenotype. Overall, our results lead us to hypothesize that, in patients with chronic HIV infection on HAART, epigenetic changes in key genes result in increased vulnerability to microbial infection in the oral cavity.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of bacterial and mycotic seal in implant systems with  different implant-abutment interfaces and closing torque values.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible leakage of 3 species of bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinomyces odontolyticus) and of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata in osseointegrated implants with different implant-abutment interface (IAI) geometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of implants, (1) implant-abutment unit with a tube-in-tube interface and (2) implant-abutment unit with a flat-to-flat interface closed with different torque values, were compared in the study. In the first phase, the implants were assembled and cultured in vitro for 7 days. The implants and abutments were disconnected and samples were taken and cultured. In the second phase, the internal part of each implant was inoculated with 0.1 microL of microbial broth and then connected to the respective abutments. Afterward, medium samples were taken and cultured. RESULTS: The group 1 implants were more resistant to colonization than those of group 2 (P < 0.05). The intragroup difference was significant between the implant-abutment units assembled with the recommended torque values and those with lower torque values (P < 0.01) for both the groups. CONCLUSION: IAI geometry influences both bacterial and yeast colonization inside the implants as well as the torque value used to connect abutments to implants.
TI  - The connection between ruptured cerebral aneurysms and odontogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms have excess long-term mortality due to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases compared with general population. Chronic inflammation is detected in ruptured intracranial aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms and coronary artery plaques. Bacterial infections have been suggested to have a role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. Bacteria have been detected both in abdominal and coronary arteries but their presence in intracranial aneurysms has not yet been properly studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the presence of oral and pharyngeal bacterial genome in ruptured intracranial aneurysms and to ascertain if dental infection is a previously unknown risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage. METHODS: A total of 36 ruptured aneurysm specimens were obtained perioperatively in aneurysm clipping operations (n=29) and by autopsy (n=7). Aneurysmal sac tissue was analysed by real time quantitative PCR with specific primers and probes to detect bacterial DNA from several oral species. Immunohistochemical staining for bacterial receptors (CD14 and toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2)) was performed from four autopsy cases. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 21/36 (58%) of specimens. A third of the positive samples contained DNA from both endodontic and periodontal bacteria. DNA from endodontic bacteria were detected in 20/36 (56%) and from periodontal bacteria in 17/36 (47%) of samples. Bacterial DNA of the Streptococcus mitis group was found to be most common. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola were the three most common periodontal pathogens. The highly intensive staining of CD14 and TLR-2 in ruptured aneurysms was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing evidence that dental infection could be a part of pathophysiology in intracranial aneurysm disease.
TI  - Interactions between Lactobacillus crispatus and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)-Associated Bacterial Species in Initial Attachment and Biofilm Formation.
AB  - Certain anaerobic bacterial species tend to predominate the vaginal flora during  bacterial vaginosis (BV), with Gardnerella vaginalis being the most common. However, the exact role of G. vaginalis in BV has not yet been determined. The main goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that G. vaginalis is an early colonizer, paving the way for intermediate (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (e.g., Prevotella bivia). Theoretically, in order to function as an early colonizer, species would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. Therefore, we quantified adherence of G. vaginalis and other BV-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with Lactobacillus crispatus using a new Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) methodology. We found that G. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of L. crispatus. Theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of G. vaginalis biofilms on the adherence and growth of other BV-associated species by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) technique. Interestingly, G. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species. Conversely, G. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of P. bivia, and to a minor extent of F. nucleatum. These results contribute to our understanding of BV biofilm formation and the progression of the disorder.
TI  - Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of Fusobacterium species bacteremia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium species (spp.) bacteremia is uncommon and has been associated with a variety of clinical presentations. We conducted a retrospective, population based study to determine the relative proportion of species in this genus causing bacteremia and the risk factors for infection and adverse clinical outcomes. METHODS: All cases of Fusobacterium spp. bacteremia detected at a regional microbiology laboratory serving outpatient and acute care for a population of approximately 1.3 million people over 11 years were identified from a computerized database. Clinical data on these cases was extracted from an administrative database and analyzed to determine underlying risk factors for and outcomes of infection. RESULTS: There were 72 incident cases of Fusobacterium spp. bacteremia over the study period (0.55 cases/100,000 population per annum). F. nucleatum was the most frequent species (61%), followed by F. necrophorum (25%). F. necrophorum bacteremia occurred in a younger population without underlying comorbidities and was not associated with mortality. F. nucleatum bacteremia was found in an older population and was associated with underlying malignancy or receiving dialysis. Death occurred in approximately 10% of F. nucleatum cases but causality was not established in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Fusobacterium spp. bacteremia in our community is uncommon and occurs in approximately 5.5 cases per million population per annum. F. necrophorum occurred in an otherwise young healthy population and was not associated with any mortality. F. nucleatum was found primarily in older patients with chronic medical conditions and was associated with a mortality of approximately 10%. Bacteremias from other Fusobacterium spp. were rare.
TI  - Effects of short-chain fatty acids on Actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  - Actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum; and the SCFA may affect biofilm development with interaction between A. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. Our aim was to investigate the effects of SCFA on biofilm formation by A. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. We used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. To determine the mechanism by SCFA, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (GrpE and GroEL) in biofilm formation was examined using Western blot fluorescence activity with GrpE and GroEL antibodies. Adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by A. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. Upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other SCFA. In the upregulated biofilm, production of GrpE and GroEL was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. The upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-GroEL antibody. The data suggest biofilm formation by A. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of SCFA increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. Production of GroEL may physically play an important role in biofilm development.
TI  - Serum antibody responses to periodontal microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a postulate revisited.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors revisited the 1999 International Workshop postulate of robust serum antibody responses to infecting agents in localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) and weak responses in generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). Antibody responses were further examined in localized and generalized chronic periodontitis (LCP and GCP). METHODS: The study includes 119 patients (60 males and 59 females, aged 11 to 76 years), 18 with LAgP, 37 with GAgP, 37 with LCP, and 27 with GCP. Multiple subgingival plaque samples/patient (1,057 in total) were analyzed with respect to 11 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridizations, and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels were measured against the same bacteria using checkerboard immunoblotting. Further, infection ratios (antibody level over the average bacterial colonization by the homologous species) were computed for each patient. Comparisons of bacterial colonization, serum IgG levels, and infection ratios were made across the diagnostic categories using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in serum IgG levels to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans among the four diagnostic categories. IgG levels to several species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Campylobacter rectus, were highest in patients with GAgP and significantly different from LCP and GCP, but not from LAgP. Comparisons based on infection ratios showed no statistically significant differences for any species between GAgP and LAgP. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence against the 1999 Workshop's postulate of weak serum antibody responses in patients with GAgP and shows that serum IgG responses in GAgP are comparable to those in LAgP, but higher than in GCP or LCP for several species.
TI  - Necrotizing pneumonia in children: report of 41 cases between 2006 and 2011 in a  French tertiary care center.
AB  - Forty-one children hospitalized for necrotizing pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed. Necrotizing pneumonia represented 0.8% of community-acquired pneumonia and 6% of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia. The chest radiograph revealed necrosis on admission in onethird of cases. Twenty-one cases (51%) were documented, including 13 Staphylococcus aureus, all Panton-Valentine leukocidin positive, 7 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 1 Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB  - AIM(S): To explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study was performed. From a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. Placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. All of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Determination of the expressions of TLR-2 and TLR-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from placental tissues and analysed by ELISA. The data were assessed using descriptive statistics. The associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: A significant increase was observed in the expression of TLR-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). Additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of T. denticola and P. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (OR: 9.39, p = 0.001, CI 95% 2.39-36.88 and OR: 7.59, p = 0.019, CI 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of T. denticola and P. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. Additionally, increased expression of TLR-2 was observed. However, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and TLRs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.
TI  - Periodontitis in pregnant baboons: systemic inflammation and adaptive immune responses and pregnancy outcomes in a baboon model.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Chronic periodontal infections have been suggested to contribute to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study describes the relationship of patterns of systemic inflammatory mediators and IgG antibody to 20 oral bacteria in pregnant female baboons (Papio anubis) coupled with clinical features of ligature-induced periodontitis, as risk indicators for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Animals showing a preterm delivery and/or low birth weight newborns, as well as those pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or fetal demise were tabulated as adverse pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: A significantly greater frequency of the periodontitis group neonates had a low birth weight (18.1%; p = 0.008) and decreased gestational age (9.8%). Spontaneous abortion/stillbirth/fetal demise were increased in the periodontitis (8.7%) versus the control group (3.8%) (p = 0.054). The baseline oral clinical presentation of the experimental animals did not relate to the adverse pregnancy outcomes. Animals with the greatest extent/severity of periodontitis progression during the initial (1/2) of gestation (ie. to mid-pregnancy) had the greatest risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Baseline biological parameters indicating historical responses of the animals to periodontal challenge demonstrated individual variation in selected mediators, some of which became more differential during ligature-induced periodontitis. The relationship of clinical parameters to systemic inflammatory responses was consistent with a temporal contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subset of the animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a link between periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the baboons and provide a prospective experimental model for delineating the biologic parameters that contribute to a causal relationship between chronic oral infections and birth events.
TI  - Subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. METHODS: Assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. One of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. No other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. RESULTS: Significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. Subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. In comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.
TI  - In vivo study of the initial bacterial adhesion on different implant materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Biofilm formation on implant materials plays a major role in the aetiology of periimplantitis. The aim of this study was to examine in vivo the initial bacterial adhesion on six different implant materials. METHODS: The implant materials Ti-m, TiUnite(R), ZiUnite(R), ATZ-m, ATZ-s, TZP-A-m were tested using bovine enamel slabs as controls. All materials, fixed on splint systems, were examined after 30 min and 120 min of oral exposure. DAPI staining was used for quantitative analysis of the initially adherent microorganisms. Initial adherent microorganisms were visualised by fluorescence In situ-hybridisation (FISH) and quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The targets of the oligonucleotide probes were Eubacteria, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus spp. RESULTS: DAPI analysis showed that increasing the time of oral exposure resulted in an increasing amount of initial adherent bacteria. The highest level of colonisation was on ZiUnite(R), with the lowest occurring on the bovine enamel, followed by Ti-m. This early colonisation correlated significantly with the surface roughnesses of the materials. FISH and CLSM showed no significant differences relating to total bacterial composition. However, Streptococcus spp. was shown to be the main colonisers on each of the investigated materials. CONCLUSION: it could be shown that within an oral exposure time of 30 min and 120 min, despite the salivary acquired pellicle initial biofilm formation is mainly influenced directly or indirect by the material surface topography. Highly polished surfaces should minimise the risk of biofilm formation, plaque accumulation and possibly periimplantitis.
TI  - Development of quantitative real-time PCR primers for detecting 42 oral bacterial species.
AB  - In this study, we introduced species-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) primers designed based on a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene (rpoB) for detecting 42 oral bacterial species. The specificity of the qPCR primers was confirmed by conventional PCR with the genomic DNAs of 73-79 strains regarding 73-75 bacterial species including the type strain for the target species. The standard curves revealed the lower detection limits of 42 bacterial species-specific qPCR primers ranged from 4 to 40 fg below a cycle threshold (C T) value of 35, except Atopobium rimae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria meningitidis, and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica which were 400 fg. These results suggest that 42 bacterial species-specific qPCR primers are suitable for applications in epidemiological studies related to oral infectious diseases such as periodontal diseases, endodontic infection, and dental caries.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. This study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with CP. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with CP in the United States. The samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/L, clindamycin at 4 mg/L, doxycycline at 4 mg/L, and metronidazole at 16 mg/L, with a post hoc combination of data for amoxicillin and metronidazole. Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the patients with CP revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. One or more test species, most often Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with CP, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either S. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP in the United States frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. The wide variability found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with CP.
TI  - Phototoxic effect of blue light on the planktonic and biofilm state of anaerobic  periodontal pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the phototoxic effects of blue  light exposure on periodontal pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. METHODS: Strains of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, in planktonic or biofilm states, were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400.520 nm. A quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp at a power density of 500 mW/cm(2) was used for the light source. Each sample was exposed to 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 seconds of each bacterial strain in the planktonic or biofilm state. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) was used to observe the distribution of live/dead bacterial cells in biofilms. After light exposure, the bacterial killing rates were calculated from colony forming unit (CFU) counts. RESULTS: CLSM images that were obtained from biofilms showed a mixture of dead and live bacterial cells extending to a depth of 30-45 microm. Obvious differences in the live-to-dead bacterial cell ratio were found in P. gingivalis biofilm according to light exposure time. In the planktonic state, almost all bacteria were killed with 60 seconds of light exposure to F. nucleatum (99.1%) and with 15 seconds to P. gingivalis (100%). In the biofilm state, however, only the CFU of P. gingivalis demonstrated a decreasing tendency with increasing light exposure time, and there was a lower efficacy of phototoxicity to P. gingivalis as biofilm than in the planktonic state. CONCLUSIONS: Blue light exposure using a dental halogen curing unit is effective in reducing periodontal pathogens in the planktonic state. It is recommended that an adjunctive exogenous photosensitizer be used and that pathogens be exposed to visible light for clinical antimicrobial periodontal therapy.
TI  - No evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (TCS)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to TCS toothpaste. Therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to TCS in toothpaste selects for TCS-resistant bacteria within the oral biofilm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. Participants had been randomly assigned to use TCS (3000 mug/mL TCS) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n = 22). Diluted plaque samples were plated on to Wilkins-Chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and TCS (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/mL) and incubated at 37 degrees C under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. Selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing and TCS minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined for each isolate. RESULTS: At 3000 mug/mL TCS no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. The MICs of TCS for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/mL in both groups. Species common to both groups had similar MICs. Veillonella parvula and Campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar MICs in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of TCS-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in MIC of TCS of oral bacterial isolates.
TI  - Oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of LL-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Some agents, including Escherichia coli and group A Streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. LL-37 is a human host defence peptide shown previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. However, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of LL-37 remains obscure. In order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on LL-37's activity against E. coli and S. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. Using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. Anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. Both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates as indicated by the growth curves generated. The sensitivities of E. coli and S. pyogenes to LL-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. The oxygen facultative E. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to LL-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. The microaerophilic pathogen S. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to LL-37 under oxygen deprivation. Our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.
TI  - Validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. Testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. The aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. METHODS: A 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/mL), amoxicillin (15 mug/mL), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/mL), and azithromycin (10 mug/mL) over 24 hours. Species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. Total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. On the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus anginosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as Campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). The strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - The microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. Assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. The samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures. In order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. The colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. Alterations in the presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's test post hoc. RESULTS: The average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. The bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. CONCLUSION: The anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.
TI  - Detection of eight periodontal microorganisms and distribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes in Chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiologic feature of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in Chinese patients has not yet been determined. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of eight periodontal microorganisms and the distribution of the Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotype in a cohort of Chinese patients with AgP. METHODS: Saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 81 patients with AgP (25 with incisor-first molar type and 56 with generalized type [GAgP]) and 34 periodontally healthy controls. Eight periodontal microorganisms, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, the distribution of fimA genotypes was assessed in P. gingivalis-positive individuals by PCR. RESULTS: The prevalence of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, C. rectus, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with AgP was significantly higher than that in healthy controls. The prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with GAgP was relatively low (30.4%) compared with other pathogens. Results of logistic regression analysis showed that younger patients were more likely to harbor A. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.85). Type II was the most prevalent fimA genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP. CONCLUSIONS: P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, C. rectus, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum were the predominant periodontal pathogens of patients with GAgP in China. Type II of fimA was the most prevalent genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP. The prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with GAgP was relatively low.
TI  - Short-term microbiological effects of scaling and root planing and essential-oils mouthwash in Chinese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term effect of scaling and root planing (SRP) and  essential-oils mouthwash on the levels of specific bacteria in Chinese adults. METHODS: Fifty Chinese adults with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to full-mouth SRP or a 7-d essential-oils mouthwash regimen. In addition, 22 periodontally healthy adults used essential-oils mouthwash for 7 d. Clinical examination and plaque/saliva sampling were performed at baseline and on Day 7. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to measure Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), and total bacterial loads in saliva, supra- and sub-gingival plaque samples. RESULTS: The detection frequencies of four tested species remained unchanged after either treatment. However, the bacterial loads of Fn, Pg, and Pi were significantly reduced by SRP; the mean reduction of bacterial counts in saliva ranged from 52.2% to 62.5% (p<0.01), in supragingival plaque from 68.2% to 81.0% (p<0.05), and in subgingival plaque from 67.9% to 93.0% (p<0.01). Total bacterial loads were reduced after SRP in supra- and sub-gingival plaque (p<0.05). Essential-oils mouthwash reduced Fn levels in supragingival plaque by a mean of 53.2%, and reduced total bacterial loads in supra- and sub-gingival plaque (p<0.01). In subgingival plaque from periodontal patients, Pg and Pi reductions were high after SRP compared to essential-oils mouthwash (93.0% vs. 37.7% and 87.0% vs. 21.0%, p<0.05). No significant bacterial reduction was observed in periodontally healthy subjects using essential-oils mouthwash. CONCLUSIONS: SRP and essential-oils mouthwash both have an impact on saliva and gingival plaque flora in Chinese periodontitis patients in 7 d, with greater microbiological improvement by SRP.
TI  - The protective effect of recombinant FomA-expressing Lactobacillus acidophilus against periodontal infection.
AB  - A number of studies have shown that the outer membrane protein FomA found in Fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates great potential as an immune target for combating periodontitis. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a useful antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunisation, and previous studies by our group have shown that L. acidophilus acts as a protective factor in periodontal health. In this study, making use of the immunogenicity of FomA and the probiotic properties of L. acidophilus, we constructed a recombinant form of L. acidophilus expressing the FomA protein and detected the FomA-specific IgG in the serum and sIgA in the saliva of mice through oral administration with the recombinant strains. When serum containing FomA-specific antibodies was incubated with the F. nucleatum in vitro, the number of Porphyromonas gingivalis cells that coaggregated with the F. nucleatum cells was significantly reduced. Furthermore, a mouse gum abscess model was successfully generated, and the range of gingival abscesses in the immune mice was relatively limited compared with the control group. The level of IL-1beta in the serum and local gum tissues of the immune mice was consistently lower than in the control group. Our findings indicated that oral administration of the recombinant L. acidophilus reduced the risk of periodontal infection with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - The lipid bilayer-inserted membrane protein BamA of Escherichia coli facilitates  insertion and folding of outer membrane protein A from its complex with Skp.
AB  - Folding of beta-barrel membrane proteins, either from a urea-unfolded form or from chaperone-bound aqueous forms, has been characterized for pure lipid bilayers. The impact of preinserted integral proteins from biomembranes has not been examined in biophysical comparisons, but this knowledge is important for the characterization of protein assembly machinery in membranes to distinguish specific effects from unspecific effects. Here, folding was studied for a beta-barrel membrane protein, outer membrane protein A (OmpA) from Escherichia coli, in the absence and presence of two other preinserted integral proteins, BamA of the beta-barrel assembly machinery complex (BAM) from E. coli and FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Three different preformed lipid membranes of phosphatidylcholine were prepared to compare the folding kinetics of OmpA, namely, proteoliposomes containing either BamA or FomA and pure liposomes. Urea-unfolded OmpA folded faster into phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing FomA than into pure lipid bilayers, but the kinetics of OmpA folding and insertion were fastest for bilayers containing BamA. Incorporation of BamA into lipid bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine greatly weakened the inhibiting effect of phosphatidylethanolamine on the folding of OmpA. Folding of OmpA from its complex with the periplasmic chaperone Skp into bilayers composed of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine was inhibited in the absence of BamA but facilitated when BamA was present, indicating an interaction of Skp-OmpA complexes with BamA.
TI  - Evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (PTLBW) is a serious problem in developing countries. The absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of PTLBW cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus and Eikenella corrodens. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated. Medical records were obtained after birth. RESULTS: Social and demographic variables were similar among the Gingivitis (G), Localized Periodontitis (LP) and Generalized Periodontitis (GP) groups. Four subjects gave birth to PTLBW neonates. Campylobacter rectus, T. forsythia, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to PTLBW neonates. The amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. The results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and PTLBW, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and non-pregnant women: A clinical and microbiologic study.
AB  - CONTEXT: Gingival changes in pregnancy have been attributed to changes in the subgingival biofilm related to hormonal variations. AIMS: To evaluate the subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and nonpregnant women to determine if pregnancy induces any alterations in the subgingival plaque and to associate these changes with changes in periodontal status. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Thirty pregnant and 10 nonpregnant women within the age group of 20-35 years having a probing pocket depth (PPD) of 3-4 mm were included in the study. The pregnant women were equally divided into 3 groups of 10, each belonging to I, II, and III trimester. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plaque index, gingival index, PPD, and microbiologic evaluation for specific bacterial counts for Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were carried out for all subjects. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Increase in gingival inflammation was observed in II and III trimester as compared with I trimester and control. Plaque scores did not show any significant difference between pregnant and nonpregnant women. Specific bacterial examination revealed an increase in proportion of P. intermedia in pregnant women of both II and III trimester as compared with I trimester and nonpregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: A definite increase in proportions of P. intermedia occurs in subgingival plaque microflora in pregnancy that may be responsible for the exaggerated gingival response.
TI  - Mobile microbiome: oral bacteria in extra-oral infections and inflammation.
AB  - The link between oral infections and adverse systemic conditions has attracted much attention in the research community. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including spread of the oral infection due to transient bacteremia resulting in bacterial colonization in extra-oral sites, systemic injury by free toxins of oral pathogens, and systemic inflammation caused by soluble antigens of oral pathogens. Mounting evidence supports a major role of the systemic spread of oral commensals and pathogens to distant body sites causing extra-oral infections and inflammation. We review here the most recent findings on systemic infections and inflammation complicated by oral bacteria, including cardiovascular disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, respiratory tract infections, and organ inflammations and abscesses. The recently identified virulence mechanisms of oral species Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Campylobacter rectus are also reviewed. A pattern emerges indicating that only select subtype(s) of a given species, e.g., F. nucleatum subspecies animalis and polymorphum and S. mutans non-c serotypes, are prone to extra-oral translocation. These findings advocate the importance of identification and quantification of potential pathogens at the subtype levels for accurate prediction of disease potential.
TI  - A case of adolescent pelvic inflammatory disease caused by a rare bacterium: Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection that typically occurs in sexually active females. PID is rare in premenarchal and/or noncoital young women; however, there are case reports of PID occurring in virginal females. We present the first reported case of PID associated with F. nucleatum. In this unusual case of PID in an adolescent, the responsible organism may have originated from the patient's oral cavity. CASE: A 13-year-old noncoital Caucasian female presented to a tertiary children's hospital with fever and acute abdominal/pelvic pain. She had experienced a perforated appendix 14 months prior, which was treated by laparoscopy. Postoperatively, she experienced intermittent episodes of recurrent abdominal pain. During this presentation, the physical examination and ultrasound findings were suspicious for an ovarian torsion. She was taken to the operating room where she had an examination under anesthesia and a diagnostic laparoscopy. Findings at the time of laparoscopy were in keeping with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. Oral and pelvic fluid cultures were positive for F. nucleatum. She was subsequently treated with antibiotics and her symptoms resolved. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of including PID in the differential diagnosis of noncoital adolescent females presenting with an acute abdomen. Although most Fusobacteria infections are periodontal in nature, translocated infections to the pelvis may have long-term implications for reproductive health. This case also highlights the importance of the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in young women who have persistent pain following previous surgery due to the potential of missed pathology or subclinical infection.
TI  - Microcalorimetric determination of the effects of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and their combination on in vitro biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC). METHODS: Titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (Streptococcus sanguinis DSM20068, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, and Porphyromonas gingivalis DSM20709) were placed in a series of IMC ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. Lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. To validate the IMC biofilm results, adherent S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and IMC. RESULTS: In all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (P <0.05). Maximum growth rate was significantly lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with controls (P <0.05). Combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. Concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. A poor correlation was observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. CONCLUSIONS: IMC gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. The combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.
TI  - Suppression of T-cell chemokines by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen in periodontal disease and is associated with immune dysbiosis. In this study, we found that P. gingivalis did not induce the expression of the T-cell chemokine IP-10 (CXCL10) from neutrophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or gingival epithelial cells. Furthermore, P. gingivalis suppressed gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-stimulated release of IP-10, ITAC (CXCL11), and Mig (CXCL9) from epithelial cells and inhibited IP-10 secretion in a mixed infection with the otherwise stimulatory Fusobacterium nucleatum. Inhibition of chemokine expression occurred at the level of gene transcription and was associated with downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and decreased levels of Stat1. Ectopic expression of IRF-1 in epithelial cells relieved P. gingivalis-induced inhibition of IP-10 release. Direct contact between P. gingivalis and epithelial cells was not required for IP-10 inhibition. These results highlight the immune-disruptive potential of P. gingivalis. Suppression of IP-10 and other Th1-biasing chemokines by P. gingivalis may perturb the balance of protective and destructive immunity in the periodontal tissues and facilitate the pathogenicity of oral microbial communities.
TI  - Advancement in the routine identification of anaerobic bacteria by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - We evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Biotyper as a tool for the identification of anaerobic bacteria compared with 500 base-pair (bp) 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing analysis, which is considered to be the "gold standard" method. A total of 484 anaerobic bacteria were retrieved from the clinical specimens of 318 pediatric patients. Molecular identification resulted in 18 genera and 51 species. The most prevalent genus was Clostridium (76.85 %), with 70 % C. difficile isolates. The concordance and sensitivity determined by MALDI-TOF MS for C. difficile, the most prevalent species isolated, was 94.08 %, whereas the specificity was 100 %. For the other anaerobes, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.07 % and 81.82 %, respectively, with a concordance of 93.15 %. Low performance was observed for Propionibacterium acnes and Fusobacterium nucleatum, for which a dedicated pretreatment procedure should likely be set up. MALDI-TOF MS was shown to be a valid alternative for the fast and reliable identification of the most clinically relevant anaerobic bacteria; moreover, it is less time-consuming, the cost for reagents is minimized, and it does not require dedicated personnel.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of Laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in Korea, Japan, and China. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of L. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of L. japonica extracts in dental care products. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined in culture medium using a microdilution method. The MICs of ethanol extracts of L. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the MBCs were 125-1000 mug/ml. The MICs of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. The MBCs of A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. The MICs were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. The killing of Streptococcus mutans and P. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. The killing of S. mutans, A. odontolyticus, and P. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. Bacterial treatment with L. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of S. mutans, A. odontolyticus, and P. gingivalis. The results of this study suggest that L. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. This is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. The objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) combined with propidium monoazide (PMA), developed for the selective quantification of viable P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PMA-qPCR method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. Matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. Biofilms were disrupted and PMA added (final concentration of 100 mum). After DNA isolation, qPCR was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. The differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. RESULTS: When PMA was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qPCR amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). Conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, PMA resulted in a significant total reduction of qPCR amplification of about 4 log10 . P. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the efficiency of PMA for differentiating viable and dead P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. Hence, this PMA-qPCR method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.
TI  - Lemierre's Syndrome: A Rare Case of Pulmonic Valve Vegetation.
AB  - Lemierre's syndrome is an uncommon complication of pharyngitis commonly associated with an anaerobic gram negative bacterium, Fusobacterium necrophorum. The syndrome usually affects young healthy adults with the mean age of 20 and is characterized by recent pharyngitis followed by ipsilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis and septic thromboembolism. The treatment is at least 6 weeks of antibiotics; the role of anticoagulation is unclear. The following presentation is a case of Lemierre's syndrome in a 23-year-old healthy individual who is infected by a rare species: Fusobacterium nucleatum. The case is complicated by septic emboli to the lungs and impressive seeding vegetation to the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) at the pulmonic valve of the heart.
TI  - Host susceptibility to periodontitis: mapping murine genomic regions.
AB  - Host susceptibility to periodontal infection is controlled by genetic factors. As a step toward identifying and cloning these factors, we generated an A/J x BALB/cJ F2 mouse resource population. A genome-wide search for Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with periodontitis was performed. We aimed to quantify the phenotypic response of the progenies to periodontitis by microCT analysis, to perform a genome-wide search for QTL associated with periodontitis, and, finally, to suggest candidate genes for periodontitis. We were able to produce 408 F2 mice. All mice were co-infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteria. Six weeks following infection, alveolar bone loss was quantified by computerized tomography (microCT) technology. We found normal distribution of the phenotype, with 2 highly significant QTL on chromosomes 5 and 3. A third significant QTL was found on chromosome 1. Candidate genes were suggested, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) 1 and 6, chemokines, and bone-remodeling genes (enamelin, ameloblastin, and amelotin). This report shows that periodontitis in mice is a polygenic trait with highly significant mapped QTL.
TI  - An investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  - Different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the pulp chambers (PCs) and root canals (RCs) of infected primary teeth using PCR methods. Paired PC and RC samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by PCR for the presence of Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella tannerae, Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Treponema socranskii. The frequency of each species was determined in the PC and RC of each case. The species most frequently detected in PCs were P. nigrescens (86.7%), P. gingivalis (73.3%), and F. alocis (73.3%). Of the PC samples, 13.3% contained P. micra and T. denticola, and 6.7% contained T. forsythia. The species most frequently detected in RCs were P. gingivalis (100%) and P. nigrescens (93.3%). P. tannerae, P. micra, and T. denticola were found in 40% of the RC samples; T. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the RC samples. The "red complex", which comprises P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia, was not found in the PC of any tooth but was found in 30% of the RC samples. The detection of P. nigrescens in the PC was statistically associated with the presence of P. nigrescens in the RC (p = 0.04). The results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.
TI  - In vitro activity of Biapenem plus RPX7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with RPX7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. Biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of RPX7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. A separate panel of 27 isolates of Bacteroides spp. with decreased susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. Comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. For recent consecutive strains of Bacteroides species, the MIC(90) for biapenem-RPX7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. Other Bacteroides fragilis group species showed a MIC90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. The MIC(90)s for biapenem-RPX7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for Prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for Fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for Gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. Against 5 B. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-RPX7009 MICs were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). Against Bacteroides strains with an imipenem MIC of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-RPX7009 had MICs of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with MICs of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. For strains with an imipenem MIC of 4 mug/ml, the MICs for biapenem-RPX7009 were 4 to 16 mug/ml, with MICs of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. The inhibitor RPX7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. Biapenem-RPX7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of different root canal sealers on three bacterial species.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria persisting in the root canal system may thwart endodontic therapy. It is therefore interesting to know whether clinically available root canal sealers have an antimicrobial effect. The objective of the present in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of various sealers on the endodontologically detectable species Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). METHODS: The antibacterial effectiveness of the sealers was tested by means of the agar diffusion test (ADT) and the direct contact test (DCT). Eight different sealers (AH Plus((R)), Hermetic((R)), RoekoSeal((R)), Sealapex((R)), Apexit Plus((R)), 2Seal((R)), EndoREZ((R)) and ProRoot MTA((R))) and two temporary sealers (Calxyl((R)) and Gangraena Merz((R))) were tested. At first, 100mul of bacterial suspension (BS) of each individual micro-organism (optical density (OD) 0.5) was applied separately to Schaedler agar plates for the ADT. Subsequently, freshly mixed and set sealer was applied. After 48h of incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. Further, 18mg of sealer were put into each well of 48-well cell culture plates and overlaid with 400mul of Schaedler liquid medium and 100mul of BS (OD 0.5) in monoculture. Bacterial growth was determined by the DCT from the optical density of the liquid by photospectrometry after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24h. RESULTS: For the application, the sealer Hermetic((R)), a significant suppression of the species E. faecalis, F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis was detected in both the ADT and the DCT. AH Plus((R)) showed a suppressive effect on E. faecalis and F. nucleatum in the DCT. With all other sealers tested, E. faecalis was not suppressible. RoekoSeal((R)), Calxyl((R)) and Gangraena-Merz((R)) showed no antibacterial effect on the tested species whatsoever. SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown in both ADT and DCT that some root canal sealers suppress the growth of E. faecalis in vitro.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of essential oils against periodontal pathogens: a qualitative systematic review.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are among the most common infectious diseases that lead to the destruction of periodontal tissues. Anaerobic gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomecetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum...) isolated from periodontal lesions, have been shown to be related to the onset and progression of periodontal disease. Given the incidence of periodontitis, increased resistance of oral bacteria to antibiotics and adverse effects of some antibacterial agents currently used in dentistry, there is a need for alternative products that are safe and effective, for prevention and treatment of these diseases. Essential oils considered traditional medicines are viewed as good alternatives. In Morocco, a wide producer of essential oils, the high prevalence of aggressive periodontitis, related to virulent periodontal bacteria isolated from pockets in Moroccan adolescents and because of the reasons evoked above, the search of a new natural agent has become a necessity. In this qualitative systematic review, the virulence and increased antibiotic resistance of periopathogens, involved in periodontitis, will be exposed, justifying the use of alternative natural agents such as essential oils-based. Studies that have investigated the efficacy of such plant-derived medicines on periodontal pathogens will be described and discussed.
TI  - Brain abscess associated with persistent left superior vena cava in a 58-year-old man.
AB  
TI  - Peptides: beta-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds as highly effective antimicrobial and anti-epithelial proliferation agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as therapeutic agents for periodontal infections has great advantages, such as broad spectrum of action, low toxicity, and limited bacterial resistance. However, their practical use is limited because of the large amount of peptide required to exercise the microbicidal function. METHODS: LyeTxI, LL37f, and KR12 cationic peptides were prepared with beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) at 1:1 molar ratios. The susceptibility of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed in anaerobic conditions. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using osteoblast and Caco-2 epithelial cells, and hemolytic activity was assessed on rabbit erythrocytes at an absorbance of 414 nm. Parameters of surface roughness and electrical charge were established by atomic force microscopy and zeta (zeta) potential, respectively. RESULTS: AMP/betaCDs drastically decreased the peptide concentration required for activity against the bacteria tested. Moreover, AMPs associated with betaCD were able to modify cell-surface parameters, such as roughness and zeta potential. On the other hand, AMP/betaCD did not alter the degree of hemolysis induced by the pure AMPs. The effective concentration at half-maximum values of the peptides and compounds on osteoblasts were greater than the concentrations required to achieve inhibition of bacterial growth in all the species tested. AMP/betaCDs inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 epithelial cells in a more efficient manner than AMPs alone. CONCLUSION: AMP/betaCD compounds more effectively inhibit periodontopathogenic bacteria than AMPs alone, with the additional ability of inhibiting the proliferation of epithelial cells at concentrations that are non-cytotoxic for osteoblasts and erythrocytes.
TI  - Subgingival bacterial burden in relation to clinical and radiographic periodontal parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This cross-sectional study characterizes the association between subgingival bacterial profile and periodontal parameters in patients assigned to coronary angiography because of cardiologic problems, which may affect the oral microbiota. METHODS: Pooled subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 477 dentate individuals during the oral examinations, along with periodontal probing depth (PD) and assessments of bleeding on probing (BOP) and radiographic alveolar bone loss (ABL). The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay was used to determine the levels of 29 oral bacteria, which were divided into three bacterial complexes. RESULTS: All bacterial combinations from the etiologic bacterial group and each species from the red complex were significantly associated (P <0.001) with grade of ABL. The prevalence of the etiologic bacterial group and the level of each species were also associated strongly with the proportion of sites with PD 4 to 5 mm and >/= 6 mm, BOP, and ABL, except Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Levels of Gram-negative oral bacteria correlated significantly with those of Gram-positive species (r = 0.840, P <0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial group, levels of Gram-negative bacteria and Treponema denticola, and the prevalence of Porphyromonas gingivalis and T. denticola associated significantly with ABL, whereas other bacterial complexes and levels of Gram-positive species did not. CONCLUSIONS: Although levels of Gram-negative and -positive species paralleled periodontal parameters, only the species considered etiologic were associated with ABL.
TI  - Clinical outcome of a nonsurgical and surgical treatment protocol in different types of peri-implantitis: a case series.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The replacement of missing teeth with dental implants has been standard practice in dentistry for many years. The success of dental implants depends on many factors, among which the diagnosis, clinical severity, and treatment of peri-implant diseases play a key role. In this prospective case series, the influence of cumulative treatment modalities on peri-implantitis with and without pus formation on clinical outcome was assessed. METHOD AND MATERIALS: During 2010, 28 patients were referred for peri-implantitis treatment. They presented two different types of peri-implant diseases: peri-implantitis with (17 implants) or without pus formation (33 implants). After microbiologic diagnosis, all patients were treated at baseline with full-mouth scaling and root planing. Two months later, further full-mouth scaling and root planing and additional antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was applied. Four months after baseline, patients with pus formation additionally underwent access flap surgery. Active human matrix metalloproteinase-8 (aMMP-8) levels were measured in eluates before and after all treatment modalities and 7 months after baseline. RESULTS: Clinical parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing) and aMMP-8-levels improved in both groups after treatment and the final examination. In periimplantitis patients without pus formation, all parameters decreased after full-mouth scaling and root planing and the additional aPDT and no surgery was necessary to improve the parameters. In patients with pus formation, the parameters decreased only after access flap surgery. CONCLUSION: The presence of pus influences the clinical outcome of the treatment of peri-implant diseases. Whereas peri-implantitis cases without pus formation can be successfully managed nonsurgically, peri-implantitis with pus formation can be effectively treated after an additional observation time of 3 months postoperatively only with additional flap surgery.
TI  - Comparative microbial analysis of paired amniotic fluid and cord blood from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 16S rRNA-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. Many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now known to have an infectious etiology. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (IAI) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS). RESULTS: Using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (AF) and cord blood (CB) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (PTB), IAI, and/or EONS. PTB cases were grouped as 1) Group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive EONS (n=6). 2) Group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed EONS with positive IAI (n=16). 3) Group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed EONS with no IAI (n=7); 4) Group 4- no EONS or IAI (n=7). In addition, samples from term healthy deliveries (n=8) served as technical controls. A total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in AF, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. Significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in CB, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant) identified, of which only 2 (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. Of those, Bergeyella, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in EONS before. The novel species identified in AF by PCR include Peptoniphilus harei and Lachnospiraceae sp. The majority (72%) of CB species were also detected in the matching AF, with E. coli and F. nucleatum as the most prevalent. The 16S rRNA sequences of paired AF and CB were 99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in EONS. Microbial species in paired AF and CB likely share the same infectious origin. Given its prevalence in EONS, F. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as E. coli.
TI  - Identification of a 43-kDa outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other Fusobacterium species.
AB  - A pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (OMP) gene of Fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the OMP of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus Fusobacterium. We identified a predicated 43kDa outer membrane protein (43K OMP) in F. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, AT-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. The predicated 43K OMP exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the OMPs of F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium ucerans, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and F. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned OMPs of Fusobacterium species. Distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and B-cell epitope regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43K OMP of F. necrophorum was closely related with the OMPs from F. nucleatum and F. periodonticum. These data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of F. necrophorum.
TI  - A molecular survey of a captive wallaby population for periodontopathogens and the co-incidence of Fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies necrophorum with periodontal diseases.
AB  - Periodontal diseases (PD) are diseases of polymicrobial aetiology and constitute  major health problems in captive macropods. Increasing knowledge of the causal pathogens is therefore crucial for effective management and prevention of these diseases. PCR survey and sequence analyses of potential periodontopathogens in captive wallaby populations revealed a co-incidence of the diseases with the detection of Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum (Fnn) and its encoded leukotoxin (lktA) gene. Sequence analyses showed that the outer membrane protein of Fnn in the GenBank database shared significant homology (99%) with the Fnn encoded haemagglutinin-related-protein gene fragment identified in this study. In addition, this report suggests the existence of a variant of Fnn with no detectable lktA gene and thus warrants further studies. In contrast to reports associating Porphyromonas gingivalis and F. nucleatum with PD, this study revealed that PD in macropods are associated with Porphyromonas gulae and Fnn and raises the question: is there a possible host pathogen co-evolution in the pathogenesis of PD in animals and humans? These findings contribute to the understanding of the aetiology of periodontal disease in macropods as well as opening up a new direction of research into the microbial interactions involved in the pathogenesis of PD in macropods.
TI  - Microbiology of the gut of the kola nut weevil, Balanogastris kolae.
AB  - Reports have shown that many insects have microbes in their gut system. Gut microbes are very important for insect vitality and much of their nutrition is derived from products of microbial metabolism. The habitat of Balanogastris kolae (Desbrocher des Loges) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) suggests that they possess the ability to digest varieties of sugars particularly starch and protein materials present in the kola nut, Cola nitida Schott & Endlicher (Malvales: Malvaceae). The aim of this study was to characterize the gut bacterial communities of the kola weevil, B. kolae. To ascertain this, the gut bacterial community of a kola nut-feeding weevil, B. kolae was characterized using culture-dependent methods. The bacterial counts in the foregut, midgut and hindgut were 7.14 +/- 0.11 x 10(6)cfu ml(-1), 2.68 +/- 0.13 x 10(7) cfu ml(-1) and 1.43 +/- 0.20 x 10(6) cfu ml(-1) respectively. There were no significant differences in the total bacterial count of the foregut, midgut and hindgut. The bacterial species were identified to be Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium fascians, Arthrobacter globiformis, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus brevis, Vibrio haemolyticus and Flavobacterium breve. The majority of these isolates were demonstrated to have both proteolytic and amylolytic activities.
TI  - Regulation of visfatin by microbial and biomechanical signals in PDL cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study was established to examine whether visfatin thought to be a link between periodontitis and obesity is produced by periodontal ligament (PDL) cells and, if so, whether its synthesis is modulated by microbial and/or biomechanical signals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PDL cells seeded on BioFlex(R) plates were exposed to the oral pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586 and/or subjected to biomechanical strain for up to 3 days. Gene expression of visfatin and toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4 was analyzed by RT-PCR, visfatin protein synthesis by ELISA and immunocytochemistry, and NFkappaB nuclear translocation by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: F. nucleatum upregulated the visfatin expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Preincubation with neutralizing antibodies against TLR2 and TLR4 caused a significant inhibition of the F. nucleatum-upregulated visfatin expression at 1 day. F. nucleatum stimulated the NFkappaB nuclear translocation. Biomechanical loading reduced the stimulatory effects of F. nucleatum on visfatin expression at 1 and 3 days and also abrogated the F. nucleatum-induced NFkappaB nuclear translocation at 60 min. Biomechanical loading inhibited significantly the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 at 3 days. The regulatory effects of F. nucleatum and/or biomechanical loading on visfatin expression were also observed at protein level. CONCLUSIONS: PDL cells produce visfatin, and this production is enhanced by F. nucleatum. Biomechanical loading seems to be protective against the effects of F. nucleatum on visfatin expression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Visfatin produced by periodontal tissues could play a major role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and the interactions with obesity and other systemic diseases.
TI  - Macrolides inhibit Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced MUC5AC production in human airway epithelial cells.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is one of the most common anaerobic bacteria in periodontitis and is responsible for several extraoral infections, including respiratory tract diseases. In this study, we examined whether F. nucleatum induces mucin secretion in airway epithelial cells. We also examined the effects of macrolides on F. nucleatum-induced mucus production compared with the effects of other antibiotics that exert anti-anaerobic activities. The production of MUC5AC, the major core protein of mucin secreted from the airway surface epithelium, in bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with culture supernatants (Sup) of F. nucleatum was analyzed by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative RT-PCR. The cell-signaling pathway of F. nucleatum Sup stimulation was also analyzed by Western blotting. For inhibition studies, cells were treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin (CLDM), and metronidazole (MTZ). The F. nucleatum Sup induced NCI-H292 cells to express MUC5AC at both the protein level and the mRNA level in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Macrolides inhibited F. nucleatum Sup-induced MUC5AC production, while CLDM and MTZ were less effective. F. nucleatum Sup induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and this induction was suppressed by macrolides. F. nucleatum Sup-induced MUC5AC production was blocked by the ERK pathway inhibitor U0126. F. nucleatum is likely to contribute to excessive mucin production, which suggests that periodontitis may correlate with the pathogenesis of chronic respiratory tract infection. Macrolides seem to reduce this mucin production and might represent an additional means of therapeutic intervention for F. nucleatum respiratory tract infections other than CLDM and MTZ.
TI  - Characterization of extracellular polymeric matrix, and treatment of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms with DNase I and proteinase K.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms are organized communities of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM), often with great phylogenetic variety. Bacteria in the subgingival biofilm are key factors that cause periodontal diseases; among these are the Gram-negative bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The objectives of this study were to characterize the major components of the EPM and to test the effect of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and proteinase K. METHODS: F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis bacterial cells were grown in dynamic and static biofilm models. The effects of DNase I and proteinase K enzymes on the major components of the EPM were tested during biofilm formation and on mature biofilm. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used in observing biofilm structure. RESULTS: Proteins and carbohydrates were the major components of the biofilm matrix, and extracellular DNA (eDNA) was also present. DNase I and proteinase K enzymes had little effect on biofilms in the conditions used. In the flow cell, F. nucleatum was able to grow in partially oxygenated conditions while P. gingivalis failed to form biofilm alone in similar conditions. F. nucleatum supported the growth of P. gingivalis when they were grown together as dual species biofilm. CONCLUSION: DNase I and proteinase K had little effect on the biofilm matrix in the conditions used. F. nucleatum formed biofilm easily and supported the growth of P. gingivalis, which preferred anaerobic conditions.
TI  - Folding and stability of outer membrane protein A (OmpA) from Escherichia coli in an amphipathic polymer, amphipol A8-35.
AB  - Amphipols are a class of amphipathic polymers designed to maintain membrane proteins in aqueous solutions in the absence of detergents. Denatured beta-barrel membrane proteins, like outer membrane proteins OmpA from Escherichia coli and FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum, can be folded by dilution of the denaturant urea in the presence of amphipol A8-35. Here, the folding kinetics and stability of OmpA in A8-35 have been investigated. Folding is well described by two parallel first-order processes, whose half-times, ~5 and ~70 min, respectively, are independent of A8-35 concentration. The faster process contributed ~55-64 % to OmpA folding. Folding into A8-35 was faster than into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers and complete at ratios as low as ~0.17 g/g A8-35/OmpA, corresponding to ~1-2 A8-35 molecules per OmpA. Activation energies were determined from the temperature dependence of folding kinetics, monitored both by electrophoresis, which reports on the formation of stable OmpA tertiary structure, and by fluorescence spectroscopy, which reflects changes in the environment of tryptophan side chains. The two methods yielded consistent estimates, namely ~5-9 kJ/mol for the fast process and ~29-37 kJ/mol for the slow one, which is lower than is observed for OmpA folding into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. Folding and unfolding titrations with urea demonstrated that OmpA folding into A8-35 is reversible and that amphipol-refolded OmpA is thermodynamically stable at room temperature. Comparison of activation energies for folding and unfolding in A8-35 versus detergent indicates that stabilization of A8-35-trapped OmpA against denaturation by urea is a kinetic, not a thermodynamic phenomenon.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial effects of two antihalitosis mouth rinses on oral pathogens and human tongue microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of a mouth rinse containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride (MR1) with a stannous fluoride-based mouth rinse (MR2) in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of the tongues from 10 subjects with and 10 subjects without halitosis were inoculated on blood agar plates. The agar was perforated, and the cylindrical holes were filled either with mouth rinse MR1 or with mouth rinse MR2. After incubation, inhibition zones of the whole tongue microbiota and Fusobacterium nucleatum were measured. In addition, MR1 and MR2 were applied in a short interval killing test (SIKT) on four oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, F. nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Total viable cell counts were made after two minutes of incubation with increasing concentrations of MR1 and MR2. RESULTS: MR1 showed a significantly higher in vitro antimicrobial activity against the whole tongue microbiota and F. nucleatum than MR2 in both groups of subjects. In the SIK test, MR1 showed a significantly greater killing capacity than MR2. The results show that a mouth rinse with low concentrations of chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride appears to be more effective in inhibiting growth of the human tongue microbiota in vitro than a fluoride/stannous fluoride-containing mouth rinse. CONCLUSION: This in vitro observation supports the use of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride in the treatment of oral halitosis.
TI  - The surface layer of Tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  - Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. The surface layer (S-layer) of T. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as TfsA and TfsB, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. Here we investigated the association of this S-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. The growth of the S-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (CS) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (WT). Next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. The survival ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated CS (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the WT (97% survival). Furthermore, significant C3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the WT. In a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum. These results indicated that the S-layer of T. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Characteristics of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in co-culture with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with chronic periodontitis and forms multi-species biofilms. They can communicate within species as well as with other species found in the subgingiva, which may induce changes in the growth ratio and virulence of periodontopathogens. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of P. gingivalis shows different virulence by growth condition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of P. gingivalis LPS when co-cultured with Fusobacterium nucleatum. After culture of P. gingivalis in the presence or absence of F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis LPS was extracted. THP-1 cells were treated with the LPS and induction of cytokine expression was investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the analysis of P. gingivalis LPS, LPS biosynthesis-related genes such as lpxA and lpxD were evaluated with real-time RT-PCR. Finally, molecular mass of lipid A was measured by mass spectrometry after hydrolysis of the LPS. Co-cultured P. gingivalis LPS exhibited higher induction of expression of interleukin 1beta, 6, and 8 than single-cultured P. gingivalis LPS. These symptoms may be caused by an increase in m/z 1689 lipid A through the upregulation of lpxA and lpxD expression by communication between P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Antibody and T cell responses to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola  in health and chronic periodontitis.
AB  - The characteristics of the T cell response to the members of oral flora are poorly understood. We characterized the antibody and T cell responses to FadA and Td92, adhesins from Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal, and Treponema denticola, a periodontal pathogen, respectively. Peripheral blood and saliva were obtained from healthy individuals and patients with untreated chronic periodontitis (CP, n = 11 paris) and after successful treatment of the disease (n = 9). The levels of antigen-specific antibody were measured by ELISA. In plasma, IgG1 was the most abundant isotype of Ab for both Ags, followed by IgA and then IgG4. The levels of FadA-specific salivary IgA (sIgA) were higher than Td92-specific sIgA and the FadA-specific IgA levels observed in plasma. However, the periodontal health status of the individuals did not affect the levels of FadA- or Td92-specific antibody. Even healthy individuals contained FadA- and Td92-specific CD4(+) T cells, as determined by the detection of intracytoplasmic CD154 after short-term in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the antigens. Patients with CP tended to possess increased numbers of FadA- and Td92-specific CD4(+) T cells but reduced numbers of Td92-specific Foxp3(+)CD4(+) Tregs than the healthy subjects. Both FadA and Td92 induced the production of IFNgamma and IL-10 but inhibited the secretion of IL-4 by PBMCs. In conclusion, F. nucleatum induced Th3 (sIgA)- and Th1 (IFNgamma and IgG1)-dominant immune responses, whereas T. denticola induced a Th1 (IFNgamma and IgG1)-dominant response. This IFNgamma-dominant cytokine response was impaired in CP patients, and the Td92-induced IFNgamma levels were negatively associated with periodontal destruction in patients. These findings may provide new insights into the homeostatic interaction between the immune system and oral bacteria and the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (SD +/- 10.3)) (NS by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). Bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. RESULTS: Mean PPD changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5 and 1.8 mm, respectively (NS between groups). BOP in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. At 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were found in the test group (site level): Fusobacterium species, Parvimonas micra, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). At week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, P. micra, and T. denticola. CONCLUSIONS: At 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar BOP and PPD improvements. At week 26 and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of Fusobacterium, P. micra, and T. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in PPD or BOP.
TI  - Exploiting preQ(1) riboswitches to regulate ribosomal frameshifting.
AB  - Knowing the molecular details of the interaction between riboswitch aptamers and  their corresponding metabolites is important to understand gene expression. Here we report on a novel in vitro assay to study preQ(1) riboswitch aptamers upon binding of 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ(1)). The assay is based on the ability of the preQ(1) aptamer to fold, upon ligand binding, into a pseudoknotted structure that is capable of stimulating -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 FS). Aptamers from three different species were found to induce between 7% and 20% of -1 FS in response to increasing preQ(1) levels, whereas preQ(1) analogues were 100-1000-fold less efficient. In depth mutational analysis of the Fusobacterium nucleatum aptamer recapitulates most of the structural details previously identified for preQ(1) aptamers from other bacteria by crystallography and/or NMR spectroscopy. In addition to providing insight into the role of individual nucleotides of the preQ(1) riboswitch aptamer in ligand binding, the presented system provides a valuable tool to screen small molecules against bacterial riboswitches in a eukaryotic background.
TI  - DNA binding to hydroxyapatite: a potential mechanism for preservation of microbial DNA.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Molecular methods are increasingly being deployed for analysis of the microbial flora in the root canal. Such methods are based on the assumption that recovered DNA is associated with the active endodontic infection, yet paleomicrobiology research is based on the recovery of ancient DNA from centuries-old tooth and bone samples, which points to considerable longevity of the DNA molecule in these tissues. The main component of dentin and bone is the mineral hydroxyapatite. This study assessed DNA binding to hydroxyapatite and whether this binding affinity stabilizes the DNA molecule in various media. METHODS: DNA was extracted from Fusobacterium nucleatum and added to ceramic hydroxyapatite for 90 minutes. The DNA-bound hydroxyapatite was incubated in different media (ie, water, sera, and DNase I) for up to 3 months. At predetermined intervals, the recovery of detectable DNA was assessed by releasing the DNA from the hydroxyapatite using EDTA and evaluating the presence of DNA by gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. RESULTS: When incubated with hydroxyapatite, nonamplified DNA was detectable after 3 months in water, sera, and DNase I. In contrast, DNA incubated in the same media (without hydroxyapatite) decomposed to levels below the detection level of PCR within 3 weeks, with the exception of DNA in sera in which PCR revealed a weak positive amplification product. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm a specific binding affinity of hydroxyapatite for DNA. Hydroxyapatite-bound DNA is more resistant to decay and less susceptible to degradation by serum and nucleases, which may account for the long-term persistence of DNA in bone and tooth.
TI  - Molecular microbiological evaluation of passive ultrasonic activation as a supplementary disinfecting step: a clinical study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This in vivo study used molecular microbiology methods to evaluate  the effects of passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) as a supplementary disinfecting step after root canal preparation. METHODS: Samples were taken from 10 necrotic root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis before (S1) and after rotary nickel-titanium instrumentation using 2.5% NaOCl as the irrigant (S2) and then after PUI for NaOCl activation (S3). The parameters examined included the incidence of positive broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for bacterial presence, the impact on bacterial diversity evaluated by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), the quantitative bacterial reduction determined by real-time PCR, and the identification of persistent species by clone library analysis. RESULTS: All S1 samples were positive for bacteria in all tests. Treatment procedures were significantly effective in reducing the incidence of positive results for bacteria, the number of bacterial cells (infectious bioburden), and the bacterial diversity (number of species and abundance). However, the supplementary PUI approach did not succeed in significantly enhancing disinfection beyond that achieved by chemomechanical preparation. Several bacterial species/phylotypes were identified in post-treatment samples that were positive for bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this clinical study including a small sample size suggest that PUI can be ineffective in significantly improving disinfection of the main root canal after chemomechanical procedures.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. The material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. The aim of this in vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (MPT) or cast titanium (CPT) and zirconia abutments (Zc). METHODS: Six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. The study was conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. Each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. Participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. RESULTS: Pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria mucosa, Porphyromonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobios, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (P > 0.05). All the other target species presented significant differences sought by Friedman test (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. CPT presented the higher mean counts, followed by MPT and Zc. CPT group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than MPT and Zc. The anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  - This report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. Streptococcus gordonii (Sg)/S. oralis (So)/S. sanguinis (Ss) and Sg/Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn)/Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of IL-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. Only the Sg/Actinomyces naeslundii (An)/Fn multispecies biofilms elicited IL-6 levels above those of control. IL-8 was a primary response to the Sg/An/Fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. These results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.
TI  - [Expression of cytokines in dentogingival sulcus in patients after dental implantation and during development of peri-implantitis].
AB  - AIM: Determination of cytokine content in various areas of dentition in patients  with peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of I and II order. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 patients with complications that developed in 3 months to 14 years after installation of intraosteal dental implants were examined. Content of cytokines in various areas of dentition was determined by using solid phase enzyme immunoassay in patients with developed peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of I and II order. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for determination of parodontopathogenic bacteria marker DNA. RESULTS: Marker DNA of I order parodontopathogenic bacteria - Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia (Bacteroides forsythus), Porphyromonas gingivalis in peri-implantation tissues during implant rejection was detected with 34.4 - 75% frequency while II order (Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micros (Peptostreptococcus micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum etc.) - with significantly lower frequency. Total concentration of IL- 1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL- 17A and INFgamma in contents of pathological pocket in the area of implants and the levels of each of them were significantly higher than in the contents of parodontal pockets, areas with stable implants and gingival fluid from areas with healthy teeth. Total interleukin content in the contents of pathological pockets in the area of rejected implants was significantly higher than in other studied areas. In the exudate of parodontal pockets of the preserved teeth it was 2.4 times lower, in the area of stable implants - 4.6 times lower, and in the areas with healthy teeth - 4.8 times lower than with rejected implants (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the study conducted allow to make a conclusion regard- ing reasonability of monitoring during dental implantation of parodontopathogenic microorganism strains and local cytokine response of the host organism with the objective of rational prophylaxis and therapy of inflammatory complications.
TI  - Method to quantify live and dead cells in multi-species oral biofilm by real-time PCR with propidium monoazide.
AB  - Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a widely used technique in analysing environmental and clinical microbiological samples. However, its main limitation was its inability to discriminate between live and dead cells.Recently, propidium monoazide (PMA) together with qPCR has been used to overcome this problem, with good results for different bacterial species in different types of samples.Our objective was to implement this technique for analysing mortality in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro with five oral bacteria: Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia. We also tested its effectiveness on biofilms treated with an antiseptic solution containing 0.07% w/w cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC).Standardisation of the qPCR-PMA method was performed on pure, heat-killed planktonic cultures of each species, detecting mortality higher than 4 log in S. oralis, S. gordonii and F. nucleatum and higher than 2 for V. parvula and P. intermedia. We obtained similar results for all species when using CPC.When we analysed biofilms with qPCR-PMA, we found that the mortality in the non-CPC treated multi-species biofilms was lower than 1 log for all species. After treatment with CPC, the viability reduction was higher than 4 log in S. oralis and S. gordonii, higher than 3 log in F. nucleatum and P. intermedia and approximately 2 in V. parvula.In short, we standardised the conditions for using qPCR-PMA in 5 oral bacterial species and proved its usefulness for quantification of live and dead cells in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro, after use of an antiseptic.
TI  - Variations in the oral anaerobic microbial flora in relation to pregnancy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy gingivitis is a major oral infection. Periodontium acts as a reservoir of inflammatory mediators and sub gingival biofilms of bacteria. AIM: To evaluate the anaerobic oral microbial flora in pregnant women before delivery and after delivery by comparing them with control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included fifteen cases of pregnant women before and after delivery and healthy non-pregnant women of same age as control group. Sub gingival plaque samples were collected with the help of dentists. The samples were inoculated immediately into Thioglycollate broth (MV010), transported to the laboratory, inoculated on to selective media for anaerobes (Hi-media laboratories) incubated anaerobically (Gas pack). RESULTS: Prevotella, Tanerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus were isolated. DISCUSSION: The anaerobic bacteria in pregnant women were Prevotella, Tanerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Viellonella and Peptostreptococcus were seen in control group and after delivery. Research suggests that periodontal pathogens may travel the blood stream from the oral cavity to the placenta. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy has significant effect on periodontal tissue. There is a significant alteration of bacterial flora during and after pregnancy. Oral health has to become a part of antenatal care /check up.
TI  - Aetiology, microbiology and therapy of periapical lesions around oral implants: a retrospective analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was: (i) to evaluate whether an endodontic pathology on the extracted tooth or adjacent teeth of an implant site has an influence on the emergence of a periapical lesion, (ii) to retrospectively analyse the outcome of different treatment strategies, (iii) to determine which bacteria were present in periapical lesions. METHODS: The endodontic status of the tooth at the implant site and the adjacent teeth was explored and linked to the periapical status of the implant. For all the lesions treated since 2000, their survival was assessed. Finally, microbial samples (culturing) from the periapical lesions, were analysed. RESULTS: If an endodontic treatment or a periapical lesion at the apex of a tooth is present, a periapical lesion around the implant can be detected in 8.2% up to 13.6% (OR 7.2). For periapical pathology at the adjacent teeth, the percentage rises to 25% (OR 8.0). The best treatment option could not be found. Bacteria were found in 9/21 lesions. The most prominent species was P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: When an endodontic pathology is present on the extracted or neighbouring teeth, it is significantly more likely that a periapical lesion will develop around a future implant.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Presence of oral bacterial species in primary endodontic infections of primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of the microbial composition of deciduous endodontic infections is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of the 10 oral bacterial species in samples from primary tooth root canals by using microarray technology and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: The samples were collected from 30 root canals of primary teeth with primer infection. The bacterial composition of the samples was semi-quantitatively defined using a microarray system (Parocheck). RESULTS: All the tested species were detected in the samples. Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most frequently isolated bacterium (96.7%), followed by Prevotella intermedia (86.7%), Parvimonas micra (83.3%), Treponema denticola (76.7%) and Tannerella forsythia (66.7%). These bacteria were also present in high levels. All pairs of bacterial species were positively associated (RR > 1), except Pintermedia and P > micra. On average, five species (range:3-8) were detected per amplified sample. Root canals of teeth with > 5 different species were statistically associated with periapical radiolucency (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Primary teeth with endodontic infections show a highly diverse variety of bacteria, in which the most prevalent specie are present in high proportions. The well-directed use of the improved microarray technology will provide additional valuable information for causative factors associated with endodontic diseases, helping to develop more successful antibacterial or anti-inflammatory treatment strategies.
TI  - Isolation and identification of Porphyromonas spp. and other putative pathogens from cats with periodontal disease.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbiota and determine the most prevalent periodontal pathogens implicated in feline periodontal disease and to correlate these findings with the clinical periodontal status. Subgingival microbiological samples were taken under sedation from 50 cats with clinical signs of periodontal disease. Pooled paper point samples from 4 selected subgingival sites were cultured on blood agar and on Dentaid-1 medium. Suspected pathogens were identified, subcultured, and preserved. The association between the microbiological findings and the clinical status was studied using correlation coefficients (CC). In addition, cats were stratified in subgroups according to presence of putative pathogens, and comparisons were carried out using unpaired t-test. Three bacterial species were frequently detected including Porphyromonas gulae (86%), Porphyromonas circumdentaria (70%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%). The mean proportion of total flora was high for P. gulae (32.54%), moderate for P. circundentaria (8.82%), and low for F. nucleatum (3.96%). Among the clinical variables, tooth mobility was correlated (CC > 0.50, p < 0.001) with recession, pocket depth, attachment level, gingival index, and calculus index (CC = 0.29, p = 0.04) as well as with total bacterial counts (CC = 0.38, p = 0.006). Cats with more than 10% of P. gulae showed significantly more mobility (p = 0.014) and recession (p = 0.038), and a tendency for deeper probing pocket depths (p = 0.084) and attachment loss (p = 0.087). The results from this cross-sectional study confirmed that P. gulae is the most relevant pathogen in periodontal disease in cats.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme Gharbia and Shah 1992 is a later synonym of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii Dzink et al. 1990.
AB  - On the basis of the DNA-DNA hybridization patterns and phenotypic characteristics, Fusobacterium nucleatum was classified into five subspecies. Previous studies have suggested that F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii is genetically similar to F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of classifying these two subspecies into a single subspecies by phylogenetic analysis using a single sequence (24,715 bp) concatenated 22 housekeeping genes of eight F. nucleatum strains including type strains of five F. nucleatum subspecies. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii and F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme were clustered in the same group and each strain of other F. nucleatum subspecies were also separated into the same cluster. These results suggested that F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii can be classified into a single subspecies. F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii was early published name; therefore, F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme Gharbia and Shah 1992 can be regarded as a later synonym of F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii Dzink et al. 1990.
TI  - Virulence mechanism of bacteria in mixed infection: attenuation of cytokine levels and evasion of polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of bacterial viability on the virulence of mixed infection. METHODS: Expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta and IL-10, respectively) was tested in vivo, following live versus heat-killed infection (mono or mixed), using the mouse chamber model of infection. Ex vivo, phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled bacteria was tested in primary mouse polymorphonuclear leukocytes by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In monoinfection, heat-killed Porphyromonas gingivalis led to augmented levels of IL-1beta 2 hours postinfection, whereas IL-10 levels remained unaffected. Phagocytosis of heat-killed P. gingivalis was reduced compared with that of the live P. gingivalis, whereas phagocytosis of heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum was augmented compared with that of live F. nucleatum. In mixed infection, both IL-1beta and IL-10 levels were augmented 24 hours postinfection when the bacteria were heat-killed. Although the phagocytosis pattern of F. nucleatum in the mixed infection remained similar to that upon monoinfection, phagocytosis of P. gingivalis was reduced following mixed infection. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory response to live mixed infection is attenuated with reduced phagocytosis, compared with that of heat-killed mixed infection. The lower response to live mixed infection could stem from a mechanism enabling the bacteria to evade the host response, thereby increasing bacterial survival.
TI  - Modulation of quaternary structure and enhancement of ligand binding by the K-turn of tandem glycine riboswitches.
AB  - Most known glycine riboswitches have two homologous aptamer domains arranged in tandem and separated by a short linker. The two aptamers associate through reciprocal "quaternary" interactions that have been proposed to result in cooperative glycine binding. Recently, the interaptamer linker was found to form helix P0 with a previously unrecognized segment 5' to the first aptamer domain. P0 was shown to increase glycine affinity, abolish cooperativity, and conform to the K-turn motif consensus. We examine the global thermodynamic and structural role of P0 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), respectively. To evaluate the generality of P0 function, we prepared glycine riboswitch constructs lacking and including P0 from Bacillus subtilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Vibrio cholerae. We find that P0 indeed folds into a K-turn, supports partial pre-folding of all three glycine-free RNAs, and is required for ITC observation of glycine binding under physiologic Mg(2+) concentrations. Except for the unusually small riboswitch from F. nucleatum, the K-turn is needed for maximally compacting the glycine-bound states of the RNAs. Formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex between the B. subtilis or the F. nucleatum RNA constructs and the bacterial K-turn binding protein YbxF promotes additional folding of the free riboswitch, and enhances glycine binding. Consistent with the previously reported loss of cooperativity, P0-containing B. subtilis and V. cholerae tandem aptamers bound no more than one glycine molecule per riboswitch. Our results indicate that the P0 K-turn helps organize the quaternary structure of tandem glycine riboswitches, thereby facilitating ligand binding under physiologic conditions.
TI  - Evidence supporting a protective role for th9 and th22 cytokines in human and experimental periapical lesions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of periapical granulomas is dependent on the host response and involves Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg-related cytokines. The discovery of new Th9 and Th22 subsets, with important immunomodulatory roles mediated by interleukin (IL)-9 and IL-22, respectively, emphasizes the need for reevaluation of current cytokine paradigms in context of periapical lesions. We investigated the expression of IL-9 and IL-22 in active and stable human granulomas and throughout experimental lesion development in mice. METHODS: Periapical granulomas (N = 83) and control specimens (N = 24) were evaluated regarding the expression of IL-9 and IL-22 via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Experimental periapical lesions were induced in mice (pulp exposure and bacterial inoculation) and the lesions evolution correlation with IL-9 and IL-22 expression kinetics was evaluated. RESULTS: IL-9 and IL-22 mRNA expression was higher in periapical lesions than in control samples; higher levels of IL-9 and IL-22 were observed in inactive than in active lesions. In the experimental lesions model, increasing levels of IL-9 and IL-22 mRNA were detected in the lesions, and inverse correlations were found between IL-9 and IL-22 and the increase of lesion area in the different time point intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Th9 and Th22 pathways may contribute to human and experimental periapical lesion stability.
TI  - Microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of infected root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to identify microorganisms from root canals with periapical abscesses and assess the susceptibility of specific anaerobic bacteria to selected antimicrobials and their beta-lactamase production. Sixty root canals were microbiologically investigated. The susceptibility of Anaerococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens to antimicrobials was evaluated with the Etest, whereas beta-lactamase production was assessed with nitrocefin. A total of 287 different bacterial strains were recovered, including 201 strict anaerobes. The most frequently strict isolated anaerobes were A. prevotii, P. micra, and F. necrophorum. The selected bacteria were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics, except A. prevotii and Fusobacterium species to azithromycin and erythromycin, as well as A. prevotii and F. necrophorum to metronidazole. None of the microorganisms produced beta-lactamase. Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominated in the root canals with periapical abscesses. All microorganisms tested were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanate, cefaclor, and clindamycin, producing no beta-lactamase.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. For this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity against two cariogenic strains (Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis). The inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. Positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. The ability to produce H(2)O(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. The gassericin A gene was checked among the Lactobacillus gasseri. All the tested strains inhibited S. mutans and A. viscosus; only one did not inhibited F. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of P. gingivalis. No inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase K. The gene of the gassericin A was not found in any strain. Only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the Glycerol Dehydratase gene. This strain has been identified by DNA 16S sequencing as a L. gasseri. Among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. Our findings suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.
TI  - Optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tanerella forsythia and Treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. RESULTS: Eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using BLAST analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mFOLD). The most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qPCR-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility. For the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of DNA extracts from isolates of closely related species. For these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the Applied Biosystems 7300, the Bio-Rad iQ5 and the Roche Light Cycler 480). For all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. The overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the Light Cycler 480. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of S. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus Fusobacterium.This can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of two hydrogen sulfide-producing enzymes from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria is responsible for oral malodour. Two  homologous hydrogen sulfide-producing enzymes, Fn1220 and Cdl, from Fusobacterium nucleatum (which actively produces hydrogen sulfide) were overproduced, purified and crystallized. X-ray diffraction data were collected from the crystals using a synchrotron-radiation source. The Fn1220 crystal belonged to tetragonal space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 (unit-cell parameters a=b=116.8, c=99.2 A) and the Cdl crystal belonged to monoclinic space group P2(1) (unit-cell parameters a=84.9, b=70.9, c=87.6 A, beta=90.3 degrees ).
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in human periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Beta-lactam antibiotics prescribed in periodontal therapy are vulnerable to degradation by bacterial beta-lactamases. This study evaluated the occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacteria in chronic periodontitis subjects of USA origin, and assessed their in vitro resistance to metronidazole at a breakpoint concentration of 4 mug/mL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens from deep periodontal pockets with bleeding on probing were removed from 564 adults with severe chronic periodontitis before treatment. The samples were transported in VMGA III and then plated onto: (i) nonselective enriched Brucella blood agar (EBBA) and incubated anaerobically for 7 d; and (ii) selective trypticase soy-bacitracin-vancomycin (TSBV) and incubated for 3 d in air + 5% CO2 . At the end of the incubation periods, the bacterial test species were identified and quantified. Specimen dilutions were also plated onto EBBA plates supplemented with 2 mug/mL of amoxicillin, a combination of 2 mug/mL of amoxicillin plus 2 mug/mL of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, or 4 mug/mL of metronidazole, followed by anaerobic incubation for 7 d. Bacterial test species presumptively positive for beta-lactamase production were identified by growth on EBBA primary isolation plates supplemented with amoxicillin alone and no growth on EBBA primary isolation plates containing both amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. A subset of such isolates was subjected to nitrocefin-based chromogenic disk testing to confirm the presence of beta-lactamase activity. In vitro resistance to 4 mug/mL of metronidazole was noted when growth of test species occurred on metronidazole-supplemented EBBA culture plates. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-four (52.1%) of the study subjects yielded beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial test species, with Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and other Prevotella species most frequently identified as beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Of the beta-lactamase-producing bacterial test species strains recovered, 98.9% were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole at 4 mug/mL. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacterial species in more than half of the subjects with severe chronic periodontitis raises questions about the therapeutic potential of single-drug regimens with beta-lactam antibiotics in periodontal therapy. The in vitro effectiveness of metronidazole against nearly all recovered beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial species further supports clinical periodontitis treatment strategies involving the combination of systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole.
TI  - High-fat diet induces periodontitis in mice through lipopolysaccharides (LPS) receptor signaling: protective action of estrogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fat-enriched diet favors the development of gram negative bacteria  in the intestine which is linked to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Interestingly, some pathogenic gram negative bacteria are commonly associated with the development of periodontitis which, like T2D, is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation. Moreover, estrogens have been shown to regulate glucose homeostasis via an LPS receptor dependent immune-modulation. In this study, we evaluated whether diet-induced metabolic disease would favor the development of periodontitis in mice. In addition, the regulatory role of estrogens in this process was assessed. METHODS: Four-week-old C57BL6/J WT and CD14 (part of the TLR-4 machinery for LPS-recognition) knock-out female mice were ovariectomised and subcutaneously implanted with pellets releasing either placebo or 17beta-estradiol (E2). Mice were then fed with either a normal chow or a high-fat diet for four weeks. The development of diabetes was monitored by an intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test and plasma insulin concentration while periodontitis was assessed by identification of pathogens, quantification of periodontal soft tissue inflammation and alveolar bone loss. RESULTS: The fat-enriched diet increased the prevalence of periodontal pathogenic microbiota like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, gingival inflammation and alveolar bone loss. E2 treatment prevented this effect and CD14 knock-out mice resisted high-fat diet-induced periodontal defects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that mice fed with a diabetogenic diet developed defects and microflora of tooth supporting-tissues typically associated with periodontitis. Moreover, our results suggest a causal link between the activation of the LPS pathway on innate immunity by periodontal microbiota and HFD-induced periodontitis, a pathophysiological mechanism that could be targeted by estrogens.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of Fusobacterium nucleatum discitis and vertebral osteomyelitis: case report and review of the literature.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: We present a case of vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in a 42-year-old female. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Infection of the vertebral bodies or disc space with this organism is rare. A review of the English literature disclosed 13 cases of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Fusobacterium spp. Because of the negative impact of this condition on the affected patients' activities of daily living, it is important to understand the clinical character and effective management of the disease to improve quality of life. Fusobacterium is an anaerobic and gram-negative microbe that is part of the normal flora of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. It is the main cause of Lemierre syndrome and has also been seen in septicemia. METHODS: The patient presented to our institution with a 3-month history of severe lower back pain. Her back pain was diagnosed as vertebral osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine revealed decreased T2 signal in the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated asymmetrical disc height loss between vertebral bodies L3 and L4 and associated periosteal reaction. RESULTS: Computed tomography-guided biopsy of vertebral bodies L3 and L4 revealed microorganism Fusobacterium nucleatum with the following in vitro susceptibilities: clindamycin </=0.5 S, metronidazole </=0.5 S, penicillin </=0.5 S, ertapenem </=4 S. Parenteral ertapenem, at a dose of 1 g every 24 hours for 8 weeks in combination with oral amoxicillin and clavulanate as oral suppression was used as medical management. At 1-month follow-up after medical treatment, the patient's inflammatory markers returned to normal values, and the infection resolved with L3-L4 autofusion. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of Fusobacterium vertebral osteomyelitis. This condition is associated with several comorbid and concomitant conditions including gastrointestinal complications. Effective treatment includes thoracolumbar orthosis bracing and intravenous antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 2-dependent activity of native major outer membrane protein proteosomes of Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen  and the etiologic agent of blinding trachoma. Intracellular signaling pathways leading to host cell inflammation and innate immunity to Chlamydia include those mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1) protein. In epithelial cells, TLR-dependent signaling contributes to local immune responses via induction of inflammatory mediators. There is evidence that TLR3, TLR4, and, particularly, TLR2 are critical for Chlamydia-mediated host cell activation and pathology. Despite the importance of TLR2, major chlamydial TLR2 antigens have not been identified so far. Numerous bacterial porins are known TLR2 agonists, i.e., porins from Neisseriae, Shigella, Salmonella, Haemophilus influenzae, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, which share structural and functional similarities with the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP), a strong antigen candidate for a potential vaccine against C. trachomatis. We describe the ability of purified, detergent-free MOMP to signal via TLR2 in vitro in TLR-overexpressing cells and TLR2-competent human reproductive tract epithelial cell lines. Using MOMP formed in pure protein micelles (proteosomes), we show the induction of TLR2-dependent interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6 secretion in vitro, the involvement of TLR1 as a TLR2 coreceptor, and the activation of both NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase intracellular pathways. Interestingly, MOMP proteosomes induce cytokine secretion in endocervical epithelial cells (End/E6E7) but not in urethral epithelial cells (THUECs). A detailed understanding of the TLR2-dependent molecular mechanisms that characterize the effect of MOMP proteosomes on host cells may provide new insights for its successful development as an immunotherapeutic target against Chlamydia.
TI  - Acute chorioamnionitis at term caused by the oral pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral pathogen associated with preterm birth. Presented is a case of acute chorioamnionitis that progressed to maternal sepsis in a term patient with intact membranes. In addition to its role in periodontal disease and preterm birth, our case demonstrates that intrauterine infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum can result in severe disease at term.
TI  - Effects of cranberry components on human aggressive periodontitis gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) causes rapid periodontal breakdown involving AgP gingival fibroblast production of cytokines [i.e. interleukin (IL)-6, a bone metabolism regulator], and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3. Lipopolysaccharide upregulates fibroblast IL-6 and MMP-3, via transcription factors (i.e. NF-kappaB). Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage and normal gingival fibroblast activities, but little is known of its effects on AgP fibroblasts. Objectives of this study are to use AgP fibroblasts, to determine cytotoxicity of cranberry components or periodontopathogen (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide +/- cranberry components, and effects of cranberry components on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated NF-kappaB activation and IL-6 and MMP-3 production. MATERIAL AND METHODS: AgP fibroblasts were incubated </= 6 d with high molecular weight non-dialyzable material (NDM) (derived from cranberry juice (1-500 mug/mL) or lipopolysaccharide (1 mug/mL) +/- NDM. Membrane damage and viability were assessed by enzyme activity released into cell supernatants and activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, respectively. Secreted IL-6 and MMP-3 were measured by ELISA. NF-kappaB p65 was measured via binding to an oligonucleotide containing the NF-kappaB consensus site. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Scheffe's F procedure for post hoc comparisons. RESULTS: Short-term exposure to NDM, or lipopolysaccharide +/- NDM caused no membrane damage. NDM (</= 100 mug/mL) or lipopolysaccharide +/- NDM had no effect on viability </= 7 d exposure. NDM (50 mug/mL) inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated p65 (P </= 0.003) and constitutive or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated MMP-3 (P </= 0.02). NDM increased AgP fibroblast constitutive or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL-6 (P </= 0.0001), but inhibited normal human gingival fibroblast IL-6 (P </= 0.01). CONCLUSION: Lack of toxicity of low NDM concentrations, and its inhibition of NF-kappaB and MMP-3, suggest that cranberry components may regulate AgP fibroblast inflammatory responses. Distinct effects of NDM on AgP and gingival fibroblast production of IL-6 (which can have both positive and negative effects on bone metabolism) may reflect phenotypic differences in IL-6 regulation in the two cell types.
TI  - Draft genome sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum ChDC F128, isolated from a periodontitis lesion.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is classified into five subspecies. F. nucleatum ChDC F128 was isolated from a periodontitis lesion and proposed as a new subspecies based on the comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the RNA polymerase beta subunit and zinc protease genes. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of the strain.
TI  - Inflammatory index and treatment of brain abscess.
AB  - This study retrospectively analyzed 12 patients with brain abscesses. Half of the patients were diagnosed inaccurately in the initial stage, and 7.2 days were required to achieve the final diagnosis of brain abscess. The patients presented only with a moderately elevated leukocyte count, serum CRP levels, or body temperatures during the initial stage. These markers changed, first with an increase in the leukocyte count, followed by the CRP and body temperature. The degree of elevation tended to be less prominent, and the time for each inflammatory index to reach its maximum value tended to be longer in the patients without ventriculitis than in those with it. The causative organisms of a brain abscess were detected in 10 cases. The primary causative organisms from dental caries were Streptococcus viridians or milleri, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Nocardia sp. or farcinica were common when the abscess was found in other regions. The primary causative organisms of unrecognized sources of infection were Streptococcus milleri and Prolionibacterium sp. Nocardia is resistant to many antibiotics. However, carbapenem, tetracycline and quinolone were effective for Nocardia as well as many other kinds of bacteria. In summary, the brain abscesses presented with only mildly elevated inflammatory markers of body temperature, leukocyte and CRP. These inflammatory markers were less obvious in the patients without ventriculitis and/or meningitis. The source of infection tended to suggest some specific primary causative organism. It was reasonable to initiate therapy with carbapenem.
TI  - Association between periodontal status and pre-term and/or low-birth weight in Spain: clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies performed over the last 15 years have suggested that periodontal diseases may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, this association has not been found in all populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether periodontal status and the presence of specific periodontal pathogens may influence the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pregnant women were clinically examined before 26th week of gestation, and divided in two groups: non-periodontitis and periodontitis. Microbial samples were obtained in the periodontitis group and processed by anaerobic culturing. After delivery, data on the pregnancy outcome were taken; mother's socio-demographic and risk factors were obtained at inclusion. Simple and multiple regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy women were included in the study (116 non-periodontitis and 54 with periodontitis). The incidence of preterm (PTB) and low-birth weight (LBW) was 2.94% and 3.53%, respectively. Periodontal status did not show any association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The presence of Eikenella corrodens was significantly related to PTB (p = 0.022) and the presence Capnocytophaga spp. was related to LBW (p = 0.008). The multivariate analyses showed a significant association between PTB and newborn weight and counts of E. corrodens. Maternal health and counts of E. corrodens were significantly associated with PTB or LBW. CONCLUSION: The clinical periodontal condition was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in a Spanish Caucasian population with medium-high educational level. The presence and counts of E. corrodens and the presence of Capnocytophaga spp. showed a significant association with PTB and LBW, respectively, in the bivariate and/or multivariate model.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine containing points against Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Up to 90% of the flora of an infected root canal consists of obligate  anaerobic bacteria. However, most studies have centred on microaerophiles. This quantitative assay investigated the antibacterial effects against Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra of gutta-percha (GP) points containing either calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) or chlorhexidine (CHX) compared to those of conventional GP points. METHODS: Standardized root canals were prepared in 192 bovine incisors. The canals were sterilized and then inoculated with one of two bacterial species (n=96 teeth per bacterium). After anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C, the inoculum was removed and the canals were filled with one of the three points. Control teeth were filled with a saline/serum mixture. After 0, 1, 4 and 8 days of anaerobic incubation, the numbers of viable bacteria (CFU/ml) were determined on both the points and the canal wall dentin. Six replicates were carried out for each experiment. RESULTS: None of the points completely eradicated the bacteria in the canal. GP+CHX was significantly more effective than GP+Ca(OH)(2) and GP (P<.05 in each case). The inhibitory effect of GP+Ca(OH)(2) did not significantly differ from that of GP (P>.05). Compared to the controls, the antibacterial effect of the medicated points was reached initially. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the in vitro model, the incorporation of commonly used medicaments in GP does not offer a long-lasting antibacterial advantage over non-medicated GP.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Myristica fragrans against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - Myristica fragrans Houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in Penang Island, Malaysia. The ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of Myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three Gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 6249, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and three Gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). Antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.25 to 640 mg/mL and 0.075 to 40 mg/mL. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing method. Among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with mean MIC value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL; P = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean MBC value ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 20 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL. While for seed and mace of Myristica fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. All of the extracts of Myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586. Thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of Myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.
TI  - Microscope-based imaging platform for large-scale analysis of oral biofilms.
AB  - A microscopic method for noninvasively monitoring oral biofilms at the macroscale was developed to describe the spatial distribution of biofilms of different bacterial composition on bovine enamel surfaces (BES). For this purpose, oral biofilm was grown in situ on BES that were fixed at approximal sites of individual upper jaw acrylic devices worn by a volunteer for 3 or 5 days. Eubacteria, Streptococcus spp., and Fusobacterium nucleatum were stained using specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. The resulting fluorescence signals were subsequently tested by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and monitored by an automated wide-field microscope-based imaging platform (ScanwedgeR). Automated image processing and data analysis were conducted by microscope-associated software and followed by statistical evaluation of the results. The full segmentation of biofilm images revealed a random distribution of bacteria across the entire area of the enamel surfaces examined. Significant differences in the composition of the microflora were recorded across individual as well as between different enamel surfaces varying from sparsely colonized (47.26%) after 3 days to almost full surface coverage (84.45%) after 5 days. The enamel plates that were positioned at the back or in the middle of the oral cavity were found to be more suitable for the examination of biofilms up to 3 days old. In conclusion, automated microscopy combined with the use of FISH can enable the efficient visualization and meaningful quantification of bacterial composition over the entire sample surface. Due to the possibility of automation, ScanwedgeR overcomes the technical limitations of conventional CLSM.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis entry into gingival epithelial cells modulated by Fusobacterium nucleatum is dependent on lipid rafts.
AB  - Host cell invasion by a major periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis, has been proposed as an important mechanism involved in host-pathogen interactions in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. The present study sought to gain insight into the underlying mechanism(s) involved in previously demonstrated fusobacterial modulation of host cell invasion by P. gingivalis. An immortalized human gingival cell line Ca9-22 was dually infected with P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Fusobacterium nucleatum TDC 100, and intracellular invasion was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). SEM observation showed that P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum formed consortia and were in the process of penetrating into Ca9-22 by 30-60 min after infection. In CSLM, Ca9-22 cells that contained both P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were frequently observed after 2 h, although cells that contained exclusively P. gingivalis were also found. Infection by P. gingivalis and/or F. nucleatum revealed evident colocalization with a lipid raft marker, GM1-containing membrane microdomains. In an antibiotic protection assay, depletion of epithelial plasma membrane cholesterol resulted in a significant reduction of recovered P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum ( approximately 33% of untreated control; p < 0.001). This inhibition was also confirmed by CSLM. Sequential infection experiments showed that timing of infection by each species could critically influence the invasion profile. Co-infection with F. nucleatum significantly enhanced host cell invasion by P. gingivalis 33277, its serine phophatase SerB mutant and complemented strains, suggesting that the SerB does not play a major role in this fusobacterial enhancement of P. gingivalis invasion. Thus, the interaction between F. nucleatum and host cells may be important in the fusobacterial enhancement of P. gingivalis invasion. Collectively, these results suggest that lipid raft-mediated process is at least one of the potential mechanisms involved in fusobacterium-modulated host cell invasion by P. gingivalis.
TI  - Protective potential of non-dialyzable material fraction of cranberry juice on the virulence of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum mixed infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a polymicrobial infectious disease. A novel potential chemical treatment modality may lie in bacterial anti-adhesive materials, such as cranberry juice fractions. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of high molecular weight cranberry constituent (non-dialyzable material [NDM]) on the virulence of a mixed infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in mice. METHODS: In vitro, the anti-adhesive property of NDM was validated on epithelial cell culture, and inhibition of coaggregation was tested using a coaggregation assay. The in vivo effect was tested on the outcome of experimental periodontitis induced by a P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum mixed infection, and also on the local host response using the subcutaneous chamber model of infection. Phagocytosis was also tested on RAW macrophages by the use of fluorescent-labeled bacteria. RESULTS: NDM was found to inhibit the adhesion of both species of bacteria onto epithelial cells and to inhibit coaggregation in a dose-dependent manner. NDM consumption by mice attenuated the severity of experimental periodontitis compared with a mixed infection without NDM treatment. In infected subcutaneous chambers, NDM alone reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels induced by the mixed infection. In vitro, NDM eliminated TNF-alpha expression by macrophages that were exposed to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, without impairing their viability. Furthermore, NDM increased the phagocytosis of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the use of NDM may hold potential protective and/or preventive modalities in periodontal disease. Underlying mechanisms for this trait may perhaps be the anti-adhesive properties of NDM or its potential effect on inflammation.
TI  - Morphological, biochemical, physiological and molecular aspects of the response of Fusobacterium nucleatum exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) of antimicrobials may result in alterations in bacterial biology with implications for its potential aggression. This has considerable importance for the resident microbiota. Our aim was to analyze the effects of SICs of antimicrobials on the morphological, biochemical, physiological and molecular characteristics of the resident anaerobic Fusobacterium nucleatum. Fourteen strains were obtained from F. nucleatum ATCC 25586, selected by culturing on SICs of ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam and subsequent culturing in the absence of drugs. Antimicrobial susceptibility, bacterial morphology, biochemical profiles and biofilm formation were evaluated. Genotyping and analysis of protein profiles were also performed. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns showed that most of the derived strains were less sensitive to the antimicrobials, even after culturing them without drugs. Morphological and cell complexity alterations were observed, mainly in strains grown in SICs of beta-lactam; these strains also expressed a reduced ability for biofilm formation. The other strains showed an increase in biofilm formation but no apparent morphological changes. Alterations were observed in the carbohydrate metabolism patterns and in the activity of microbial enzymes. Several proteins were positively or negatively regulated and there was polymorphism in the DNA from all derived strains. Therefore, SICs of antimicrobials induce alterations in F. nucleatum, which directly impact its biology. These results emphasize the risk of inadequate antibioticotherapy, which may have serious implications for clinical microbiology and infectious diseases and also may interfere with the host-bacteria relationship.
TI  - Detection and enumeration of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm of pregnant women.
AB  - The aim of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique to test the hypothesis of qualitative and quantitative differences of 8 periodontopathogens between pregnant and non-pregnant women. This cross-sectional study included 20 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. Probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were collected and the FISH technique identified the presence and numbers of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. The mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. The clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of P. intermedia in pregnant women. Colonization patterns of the different bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease were not different in the subgingival plaque of pregnant and non-pregnant women.
TI  - Maternal oral origin of Fusobacterium nucleatum in adverse pregnancy outcomes as  determined using the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic transcribed spacer region.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common Gram-negative anaerobe prevalent in the oral cavity, possesses the ability to colonize the amniotic cavity and the fetus. However, F. nucleatum may also be part of the vaginal microbiota from where it could reach the amniotic tissues. Due to the heterogeneity of F. nucleatum, consisting of five subspecies, analysis at the subspecies/strain level is desirable to determine its precise origin. The aims of this study were: (i) to evaluate the use of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region as a tool to differentiate subspecies of F. nucleatum, and (ii) to design a simplified technique based on the ITS to determine the origin of F. nucleatum strains associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Amplified fragments of the 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS region corresponding to the five subspecies of F. nucleatum were subjected to cloning and sequencing to characterize the different ribosomal operons of the subspecies. Distinctive length and sequence patterns with potential to be used for identification of the subspecies/strain were identified. These were used to evaluate the origin of F. nucleatum identified in neonatal gastric aspirates (swallowed amniotic fluid) by sequence comparisons with the respective oral and vaginal maternal samples. A simplified technique using a strain-specific primer in a more sensitive nested PCR was subsequently developed to analyse ten paired neonatal-maternal samples. Analysing the variable fragment of the ITS region allowed the identification of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum from an oral origin as potentially being involved in neonatal infections. Using a strain-specific primer, the F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain was detected in both neonatal gastric aspirates and maternal oral samples in cases of preterm birth from mothers presenting with localized periodontal pockets. Interestingly, the same strain was not present in the vaginal sample of any case investigated. The 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS can be a useful tool to determine the origin of F. nucleatum. The results of this study strongly indicate that F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum of oral origin could be involved with pregnancy complications.
TI  - Genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  - Pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. To date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study among 1,020 white participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. We examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) colonization. Genotyping was performed on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform. Imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on HapMap II-CEU, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold of p < 5 x 10(-8)). We detected no genome-wide significant signals. However, 13 loci, including KCNK1, FBXO38, UHRF2, IL33, RUNX2, TRPS1, CAMTA1, and VAMP3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. All associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for Aa, had the same effect direction in a second sample of 123 African-American participants. None of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. Investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.
TI  - Proteomics of Streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. It is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. We have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of P. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of S. gordonii, P. gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Here we report the adaptation of S. gordonii to the same model. RESULTS: 1122 S. gordonii proteins were detected in S. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with F. nucleatum, 849 with P. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. Quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis individually or both P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum together. The changes were species specific, though the P. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with P. gingivalis or both P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. The results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using DAVID. Extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. These results were seen across all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. F. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. P. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. The communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. CONCLUSION: This study showed that S. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis. Extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.
TI  - Isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. Thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. To assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees C by IMC. The microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (S. sanguinis 41.3 +/- 4.8%, F. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and P. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). IMC revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by microscopy. Peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muW), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muW), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 J) showed very high variation. These IMC results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. The present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.
TI  - Draft genome sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme ATCC 51190T.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, one of the major causative bacteria of periodontitis, is classified into five subspecies (nucleatum, polymorphum, vincentii, animalis, and fusiforme) on the basis of the several phenotypic characteristics and DNA homology. This is the first report of the draft genome sequence of F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme ATCC 51190(T).
TI  - A proteomic investigation of Fusobacterium nucleatum alkaline-induced biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Gram negative anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum has been implicated in the aetiology of periodontal diseases. Although frequently isolated from healthy dental plaque, its numbers and proportion increase in plaque associated with disease. One of the significant physico-chemical changes in the diseased gingival sulcus is increased environmental pH. When grown under controlled conditions in our laboratory, F. nucleatum subspecies polymorphum formed mono-culture biofilms when cultured at pH 8.2. Biofilm formation is a survival strategy for bacteria, often associated with altered physiology and increased virulence. A proteomic approach was used to understand the phenotypic changes in F. nucleatum cells associated with alkaline induced biofilms. The proteomic based identification of significantly altered proteins was verified where possible using additional methods including quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), enzyme assay, acidic end-product analysis, intracellular polyglucose assay and Western blotting. RESULTS: Of 421 proteins detected on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, spot densities of 54 proteins varied significantly (p < 0.05) in F. nucleatum cultured at pH 8.2 compared to growth at pH 7.4. Proteins that were differentially produced in biofilm cells were associated with the functional classes; metabolic enzymes, transport, stress response and hypothetical proteins. Our results suggest that biofilm cells were more metabolically efficient than planktonic cells as changes to amino acid and glucose metabolism generated additional energy needed for survival in a sub-optimal environment. The intracellular concentration of stress response proteins including heat shock protein GroEL and recombinational protein RecA increased markedly in the alkaline environment. A significant finding was the increased abundance of an adhesin, Fusobacterial outer membrane protein A (FomA). This surface protein is known for its capacity to bind to a vast number of bacterial species and human epithelial cells and its increased abundance was associated with biofilm formation. CONCLUSION: This investigation identified a number of proteins that were significantly altered by F. nucleatum in response to alkaline conditions similar to those reported in diseased periodontal pockets. The results provide insight into the adaptive mechanisms used by F. nucleatum biofilms in response to pH increase in the host environment.
TI  - Ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol differentially modulate reactive oxygen species generation by neutrophils in response to FcgammaR and TLR agonists.
AB  - Periodontitis, a ubiquitous chronic inflammatory disease, is associated with reduced antioxidant defences and neutrophil hyperactivity in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Its phenotype is thus characterized by oxidative stress. We have determined the effect of antioxidant micronutrients ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol on neutrophil ROS generation. Peripheral neutrophils from periodontally-healthy individuals (n = 20) were challenged with phorbol myristate acetate, IgG-opsonised Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum or PBS in the presence and absence of micronutrients (50 microM). Total and extracellular ROS were measured by luminol and isoluminol chemiluminescence respectively. Total and extracellular unstimulated, baseline ROS generation was unaffected by alpha-tocopherol, but inhibited by ascorbate and a combination of both micronutrients. Fcgamma-receptor (Fcgamma-R)-stimulated total or extracellular ROS generation was not affected by the presence of individual micronutrients. However, the combination significantly reduced extracellular FcgammaR-stimulated ROS release. Neither micronutrient inhibited TLR-stimulated total ROS, but the combination caused inhibition. Ascorbate and the micronutrient combination, but not alpha-tocopherol, inhibited extracellular ROS release by TLR-stimulated cells. Such micronutrient effects in vivo could be beneficial in reducing collateral tissue damage in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis, while retaining immune-mediated neutrophil function.
TI  - Bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. Growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. The quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. Compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. CONCLUSION: It was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.
TI  - Micronutrient modulation of NF-kappaB in oral keratinocytes exposed to periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Chronic periodontal diseases are characterised by a dysregulated and exaggerated  inflammatory/immune response to plaque bacteria. We have demonstrated previously that oral keratinocytes up-regulate key molecular markers of inflammation, including NF-kappaB and cytokine signalling, when exposed to the periodontal bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in vitro. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether alpha-lipoic acid was able to abrogate bacterially-induced pro-inflammatory changes in the H400 oral epithelial cell line. Initial studies indicated that alpha-lipoic acid supplementation (1-4 mM) significantly reduced cell attachment; lower concentrations (<0.5 mM) enabled >85% cell adhesion at 24 h. While a pro-inflammatory response, demonstrable by NF-kappaB translocation, gene expression and protein production was evident in H400 cells following exposure to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, pre-incubation of cells with 0.5 mM alpha-lipoic acid modulated this response. alpha-Lipoic acid pre-treatment significantly decreased levels of bacterially-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 protein production, and differentially modulated transcript levels for IL-8, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF, TLR2, 4, 9, S100A8, S100A9, lysyl oxidase, NF-kappaB1, HMOX, and SOD2. Overall, the data indicate that alpha-lipoic acid exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on oral epithelial cells exposed to periodontal bacteria and thus may provide a novel adjunctive treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of oral pathogens.
AB  - Periodontitis is a bacterial disease that can be treated with systemic antibiotics. The aim of this study was to establish the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of five periodontal pathogens to six commonly used antibiotics in periodontics. A total of 247 periodontal bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to the six antibiotics using the Etest method. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) were calculated. Both European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints were used in the study to interpret results. beta-Lactamase production was tested when amoxicillin resistance was found. MIC(90) values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of Prevotella intermedia and one isolate of Fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (CLSI breakpoints); these isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. Two isolates of the capnophilic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show beta-lactamase activity. Comparison with a previous study from The Netherlands showed minor differences in susceptibility profiles, but the MIC(90) values of A. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and tetracycline were higher. Geographical differences in the susceptibility profiles of Porphyromonas gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans between European countries were noted. Comparison of European susceptibility profiles with that of a South American country (Colombia) revealed a much higher resistance in the latter. Owing to these differences in susceptibility profiles, it is of concern to regularly perform surveillance studies on antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Periodontal pathogen load and increased antibody response to heat shock protein 60 in patients with cardiovascular disease.
AB  - AIM: To determine the relationship between periodontal pathogen load and anti-human heat shock protein 60 (hHSP60) antibodies in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were cardiovascular patients (n = 74) with a previous hospital admission for myocardial infarction. Concurrent periodontal pathogen load of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Serum antibodies to these pathogens, GroEL and hHSP60 were determined using an ELISA. RESULTS: There was a trend for increasing anti-hHSP60 antibody as the number of bacterial species increased. The strongest positive correlations were found between anti-hHSP60 levels and numbers of T. forsythia (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and between anti-hHSP60 and anti-GroEL levels (r = 0.39; p = 0.001). Patients with extensive periodontal pocketing (>/=4 mm) had higher numbers of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia (p < 0.05) and a higher subgingival pathogen load (p < 0.05) than patients with minimal pocketing (</=1 site >/= 4 mm). They also had significantly elevated anti-hHSP60 levels (p < 0.05). Overall, the highest anti-hHSP60 levels were seen in patients with extensive periodontal pocketing and all four bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: In cardiovascular patients, a greater burden of subgingival infection with increased levels of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia is associated with modestly higher anti-hHSP60 levels.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum infection mimicking metastatic cancer.
AB  - A 48-year-old man presented with fevers, chills, weight loss, multiple liver masses, and several superficial and deep venous thromboses in lower extremities. Cancer work up was negative. A liver biopsy grew Fusobacterium nucleatum. To our knowledge, F. nucleatum infection presenting with multiple liver masses and Trousseau-like syndrome has not been reported earlier.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis mediates inflammasome repression in polymicrobial cultures through a novel mechanism involving reduced endocytosis.
AB  - The interleukin (IL)-1beta-processing inflammasome has recently been identified as a target for pathogenic evasion of the inflammatory response by a number of bacteria and viruses. We postulated that the periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis may suppress the inflammasome as a mechanism for its low immunogenicity and pathogenic synergy with other, more highly immunogenic periodontal bacteria. Our results show that P. gingivalis lacks signaling capability for the activation of the inflammasome in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, P. gingivalis can suppress inflammasome activation by another periodontal bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum. This repression affects IL-1beta processing, as well as other inflammasome-mediated processes, including IL-18 processing and cell death, in both human and mouse macrophages. F. nucleatum activates IL-1beta processing through the Nlrp3 inflammasome; however, P. gingivalis repression is not mediated through reduced levels of inflammasome components. P. gingivalis can repress Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by Escherichia coli, and by danger-associated molecular patterns and pattern-associated molecular patterns that mediate activation through endocytosis. However, P. gingivalis does not suppress Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by ATP or nigericin. This suggests that P. gingivalis may preferentially suppress endocytic pathways toward inflammasome activation. To directly test whether P. gingivalis infection affects endocytosis, we assessed the uptake of fluorescent particles in the presence or absence of P. gingivalis. Our results show that P. gingivalis limits both the number of cells taking up beads and the number of beads taken up for bead-positive cells. These results provide a novel mechanism of pathogen-mediated inflammasome inhibition through the suppression of endocytosis.
TI  - Osteomyelitis of a long bone due to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces meyeri in an immunocompetent adult: a case report and literature review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium species are uncommon causes of osteomyelitis. These organisms are normal flora of the oral cavity. Therefore, they mostly cause osteomyelitis of the head and neck. Hematogenous osteomyelitis at distant sites other than the head and neck has rarely been reported in pediatric or immunocompromised patients. Here, we report the first case of osteomyelitis of a long bone combined with a muscle abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in an otherwise healthy adult. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Korean man was admitted for pain and swelling of the right lower leg, which had been persistent for two weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging showed osteomyelitis of the right fibula with a surrounding muscle abscess of the right lower leg. Incision and drainage was performed, and repetitive tissue cultures grew F. nucleatum. In this patient, it was presumed that recurrent periodontitis caused hematogenous seeding of F. nucleatum to a distant site leading to osteomyelitis with a muscle abscess. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam for three weeks and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for eight weeks. He also underwent repeated surgical drainage. He has no evidence of recurrence after seven months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that F. nucleatum could be the etiologic agent of hematogenous osteomyelitis of a long bone in an immunocompetent patient.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. Limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. Here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (BBE) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effects of whole and fractionated BBE on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. The bactericidal effects of whole BBE against Fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs). Cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (OKF6) cells. RESULTS: BBE at 350-1400 mug/mL reduced the metabolic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis, F. nucleatum and Streptococcus mutans. The reduced metabolic activity observed for F. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of CFUs following exposure to BBE for as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. An anthocyanin-enriched fraction of BBE reduced the metabolic activity of F. nucleatum, but not of P. gingivalis or S. mutans, suggesting the contribution of species-specific agents in the whole BBE. Oral epithelial cell viability was not reduced following exposure to whole BBE (2.24-1400 mug/mL) for </= 6 h. CONCLUSION: BBE alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. The specific antibacterial properties of BBE shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.
TI  - Insights into the virulence of oral biofilms: discoveries from proteomics.
AB  - This review covers developments in the study of polymicrobial communities, biofilms and selected areas of host response relevant to dental plaque and related areas of oral biology. The emphasis is on recent studies in which proteomic methods, particularly those using mass spectrometry as a readout, have played a major role in the investigation. The last 5-10 years have seen a transition of such methods from the periphery of oral biology to the mainstream, as in other areas of biomedical science. For reasons of focus and space, the authors do not discuss biomarker studies relevant to improved diagnostics for oral health, as this literature is rather substantial in its own right and deserves a separate treatment. Here, global gene regulation studies of plaque-component organisms, biofilm formation, multispecies interactions and host-microbe interactions are discussed. Several aspects of proteomics methodology that are relevant to the studies of multispecies systems are commented upon.
TI  - Efficacy of berberine, an antimicrobial plant alkaloid, as an endodontic irrigant against a mixed-culture biofilm in an in vitro tooth model.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Berberine, a plant alkaloid isolated from many medicinal plants, has shown antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of berberine solution against selected endodontic pathogens using a multispecies biofilm tooth model. METHODS: The bacterial species used in the multispecies biofilm tooth model were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Prevotella intermedia. Extracted human anterior teeth were collected and standardized to a length of 14.0 mm. Teeth were cultured in Schaedler broth with the 3 test bacteria strains for 21 days and then randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups (ie, sterile saline, 5.25% NaOCl, 2% chlorhexidine [CHX], 1% CHX, 2 mg/mL berberine, and 1 mg/mL berberine plus 1% CHX). The teeth were instrumented to size 35/.06 and irrigated with 6 mL irrigant for 2 minutes. Surviving bacteria were sampled before and after instrumentation. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (P < .05) followed by the Scheffe test. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentration of berberine against F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and E. faecalis was 31.25 mug/mL, 3.8 mug/mL, and 500 mug/mL, respectively. Instrumentation and irrigation resulted in 99% bacterial reduction in all groups. All tested solutions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in bacteria when compared with the saline control. When used alone, berberine (2 mg/mL) was less effective than the other test irrigants. However, when combined with 1% CHX, berberine (2 mg/mL) was comparable in bactericidal activity with 5.25% NaOCl, 2% CHX, and 1% CHX (Table 2). CONCLUSIONS: Berberine was more effective than saline as an endodontic irrigant against selected endodontic pathogens in vitro and, when combined with CHX, was comparable with NaOCl in its bactericidal efficacy.
TI  - Comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [LPSs]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating LPS contents with clinical/radiographic findings. In addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. METHODS: Samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. The limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16S rDNA) was used for bacterial investigation. RESULTS: Endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 EU/mL and 3.96 EU/mL, respectively (P < .05). The median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (P < .05). A positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (P < .05). Prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), Fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), Treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and Treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. P. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). CONCLUSIONS: Teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. Moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.
TI  - Effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) against periodontal disease-causing Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) against periodontal disease-causing Fusobacterium nucleatum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four White Leghorn hens (120 days old) were immunized with whole Fus. nucleatum cells killed with 1% formaldehyde using three injections provided at 2-week intervals. IgY was produced from egg yolks obtained from these immunized hens using water dilution, two-step salt precipitation and ultrafiltration. This IgY was shown to have a purity of 86.8% based on its optical intensity in the stained SDS-PAGE bands. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated a high specificity for the IgY against Fus. nucleatum with a maximum antibody titre of 80 000. The IgY had only weak cross-reactivity with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Solobacterium moorei. Growth and biofilm formation by Fus. nucleatum were inhibited by IgY at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg ml(-1) . Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscope assays revealed a high binding ability of specific IgY, which may explain the in vitro effectiveness of IgY. In an in vivo study, IgY treatment resulted in a marked decrease in alveolar bone loss after Fus. nucleatum infection in a mouse model confirming the effectiveness of IgY against periodontal disease-causing Fus. nucleatum. CONCLUSIONS: IgY effectively inhibited growth and biofilm formation by Fus. nucleatum and prevented the progression of periodontal disease by decreasing alveolar bone loss. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Specific IgY may have potential for the treatment of periodontal disease.
TI  - Pseudoknot preorganization of the preQ1 class I riboswitch.
AB  - To explore folding and ligand recognition of metabolite-responsive RNAs is of major importance to comprehend gene regulation by riboswitches. Here, we demonstrate, using NMR spectroscopy, that the free aptamer of a preQ(1) class I riboswitch preorganizes into a pseudoknot fold in a temperature- and Mg(2+)-dependent manner. The preformed pseudoknot represents a structure that is close to the ligand-bound state and that likely represents the conformation selected by the ligand. Importantly, a defined base pair mutation within the pseudoknot interaction stipulates whether, in the absence of ligand, dimer formation of the aptamer competes with intramolecular pseudoknot formation. This study pinpoints how RNA preorganization is a crucial determinant for the adaptive recognition process of RNA and ligand.
TI  - Strain-specific colonization patterns and serum modulation of multi-species oral  biofilm development.
AB  - Periodontitis results from an ecological shift in the composition of subgingival  biofilms. Subgingival community maturation is modulated by inter-organismal interactions and the relationship of communities with the host. In an effort to better understand this process, we evaluated biofilm formation, with oral commensal species, by three strains of the subgingivally prevalent microorganism Fusobacterium nucleatum and four strains of the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. We also tested the effect of serum, which resembles gingival exudates, on subgingival biofilms. Biofilms were allowed to develop in flow cells using salivary medium. We found that although not all strains of F. nucleatum were able to grow in mono-species biofilms, forming a community with health-associated partners Actinomyces oris and Veillonella parvula promoted biofilm growth of all F. nucleatum strains. Strains of P. gingivalis also showed variable ability to form mono-species biofilms. P. gingivalis W50 and W83 did not form biofilms, while ATCC 33277 and 381 formed biofilm structures, but only strain ATCC 33277 grew over time. Unlike the enhanced growth of F. nucleatum with the two health-associated species, no strain of P. gingivalis grew in three-species communities with A. oris and V. parvula. However, addition of F. nucleatum facilitated growth of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 with health-associated partners. Importantly, serum negatively affected the adhesion of F. nucleatum, while it favored biofilm growth by P. gingivalis. This work highlights strain specificity in subgingival biofilm formation. Environmental factors such as serum alter the colonization patterns of oral microorganisms and could impact subgingival biofilms by selectively promoting pathogenic species.
TI  - Subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. However, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of DM on periodontal subgingival microbiota. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. Subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing technique. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of TM7, Aggregatibacter, Neisseria, Gemella, Eikenella, Selenomonas, Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of Porphyromonas, Filifactor, Eubacterium, Synergistetes, Tannerella and Treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). Moreover, some phylotypes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella parvula, V. dispar and Eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of nanoparticulate metal oxides against peri-implantitis pathogens.
AB  - Dental plaque accumulation may result in peri-implantitis, an inflammatory process causing loss of supporting bone that may lead to dental implant failure. The antimicrobial activities of six metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and two of their composites against bacterial pathogens associated with peri-implantitis were examined under anaerobic conditions. The activities of nanoparticles of silver (Ag), cuprous oxide (Cu(2)O), cupric oxide (CuO), zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), tungsten oxide (WO(3)), Ag+CuO composite and Ag+ZnO composite were assessed by minimum inhibitory (bacteriostatic) concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Time-kill assays were carried out to examine the dynamics of the antimicrobial activity with ZnO nanoparticles. MIC and MBC values were in the range of <100 mug/mL to 2500 mug/mL and <100 mug/mL to >2500 mug/mL, respectively. The activity of the nanoparticles tested in descending order was Ag>Ag+CuO>Cu(2)O>CuO>Ag+ZnO>ZnO>TiO(2)>WO(3). Time-kill assays with ZnO demonstrated a significant decrease in growth of all species tested within 4h, reaching 100% within 2h for P. gingivalis and within 3h for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. Coating titanium surfaces of dental and orthopaedic implants with antimicrobial nanoparticles should lead to an increased rate of implant success.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota from Cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  - This present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the Cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the Tufted Capuchin Monkey Procreation Center (Sao Paulo State University - UNESP) or free-ranging monkeys. For this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. The primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to VMGA III transport medium and ultrapure water. The microbiota was cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial DNA was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using PCR and real-time PCR. The actinomycetes, fusobacteria, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic rods, Tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Dialister pneumosintes and Prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas Treponema denticola was not found. Populations of C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess: treatment with immediate tonsillectomy - 10 years of experience.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Immediate tonsillectomy in patients with peritonsillar abscess is a safe and effective treatment that should be considered as an alternative to conventional incision and drainage. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and microbiology of immediate tonsillectomy over 10 years, in patients with peritonsillar abscess. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. We reviewed the clinical charts of patients diagnosed with peritonsillar abscess in Clinica Las Condes from September 2000 to August 2010, who were treated with immediate unilateral or bilateral tonsillectomy. The patients' epidemiological information, antibiotic therapy, laterality of the surgery, results of microbiological cultures, complications, and recurrences were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were studied, with a mean age of 24 years. There were no events of sepsis, and there were only four cases (3.6%) of postoperative bleeding, two of which resolved spontaneously. Only 29% of the patients required morphine pump-based analgesia in the postoperative period. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.4 days. Among the 28 unilateral tonsillectomies, 4 (14.2%) developed streptococcal tonsillitis and 2 (7.1%) were readmitted with a contralateral peritonsillitis: one cellulitis and one abscess that required drainage and tonsillectomy. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci) and anaerobic bacteria (mainly Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum).
TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - Probiotic effects of orally administered Lactobacillus reuteri-containing tablets on the subgingival and salivary microbiota in patients with gingivitis. A randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of an orally administered probiotic on the  oral microbiota. METHODS: A placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 40 gingivitis subjects during 8 weeks. Treatment consisted on the administration of a daily tablet, either containing Lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. Unstimulated saliva and subgingival samples were collected and analysed by culture and PCR. Clinical and microbiological outcome variables were compared between and within groups. RESULTS: There were no significant changes between and within the groups in the clinical variables. In saliva, total anaerobic counts after 4 weeks (p = 0.021) and counts of Prevotella intermedia after 8 weeks (p = 0.030), showed reductions in the test group. In subgingival samples, significant reductions in the changes baseline to 4 weeks were observed for P. gingivalis counts (p = 0.008). With PCR, L. reuteri ATCC-PTA-5289 was more frequently detected than L. reuteri DSM-17938. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of L. reuteri administered in tablets resulted in a reduction in the number of selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microbiota, without an associated clinical impact.
TI  - Effect of S-PRG Eluate on Biofilm Formation and Enzyme Activity of Oral Bacteria.
AB  - Recently, the antibacterial activity of a composite resin containing prereacted glass ionomer (S-PRG) filler was revealed. We examined the effect of an S-PRG eluate on various biologic activities of Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Adherence ability of S. mutans was evaluated by microtiter plate assay; protease and gelatinase activities of P. gingivalis were examined by synthetic substrate hydrolysis and gelatin film spot assay, respectively. Coaggregation of P. gingivalis with Fusobacterium nucleatum was also examined. S-PRG eluate was found to suppress streptococcal adherence. S-PRG eluate inhibited the protease and gelatinase activities of P. gingivalis and the coaggregation between P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. These results indicate that S-PRG eluate suppresses streptococcal adherence and inhibits the protease and coaggregation activities of P. gingivalis. These findings may prompt research into novel strategies for preventing caries and periodontitis.
TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of Bacterial Flora in Postoperative Maxillary Cyst Fluid by 16S rRNA Gene and Culture Methods.
AB  - Intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (POMC), and DNA was extracted from the POMC fluid. Bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16S rRNA gene. Identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. The phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16S rRNA gene clones. A total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. A total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in POMC fluid samples by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Species of Prevotella (91%), Neisseria (73%), Fusobacterium (73%), Porphyromonas (73%), and Propionibacterium (73%) were found to be highly prevalent in all patients. Streptococcus mitis (64%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (55%), Propionibacterium acnes (55%), Staphylococcus capitis (55%), and Streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. The results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by 16S rRNA gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with POMC.
TI  - [Lemierre's syndrome as differential diagnosis of lung cancer].
AB  - Lemierre's syndrome is a disseminated infection which is usually caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. An oropharyngeal infection progresses to a septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and later metastatic infections throughout the body occur. We present a clinical case in which a patient, initially presenting with symptoms characteristic of pulmonary cancer, turned out to have a rare variant of Lemierre's syndrome caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - Co-localized or randomly distributed? Pair cross correlation of in vivo grown subgingival biofilm bacteria quantified by digital image analysis.
AB  - The polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. A number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. To examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). This modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. Selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (Tannerella forsythia with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis with Prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. Pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of F. nucleatum/periodonticum and T. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 microm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 microm. While these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for F. nucleatum and T. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in the in vivo samples. In conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. More importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for "as-yet-uncultured" phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro.
TI  - Autoinducer 2 of Fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  - Periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of Gram-negative anaerobes. Autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is a universal quorum sensing (QS) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. As Fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that AI-2 of F. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified F. nucleatum AI-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between F. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia). Then we tested the effect of two QS inhibitors (QSIs), (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5H)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on AI-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. F. nucleatum AI-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between F. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of which were inhibited by the QSIs. F. nucleatum AI-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the QSIs. Our results demonstrate that F. nucleatum AI-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.
TI  - Pulmonary botryomycosis on a lung cavity: a rare pulmonary infection mimicking cancer.
AB  - Lung botryomycosis is a rare disease. We report what is to our knowledge the first case occurring on a lung cavity. In a 42-year-old man suffering asthenia and cough, a chest radiograph revealed a right upper lobe opacity. Computed tomography scan showed a necrotic mass which was also spiculated. Repeated research for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. The patient underwent a lobectomy. Histological and bacteriological examinations made the diagnosis of botryomycosis, because the cavity presented numerous colonies of pyogenic Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteria. Botryomycosis is a difficult diagnosis that clinically mimics actinomycosis, tuberculosis or cancer. In most cases, surgery is necessary to assess diagnosis and treatment.
TI  - The FomA porin from Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Toll-like receptor 2 agonist with immune adjuvant activity.
AB  - Many bacterial components selectively activate immune and nonhematopoietic target cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling; modulation of such host responses defines the immune adjuvant properties of these bacterial products. For example, the outer membrane protein porins from Neisseria, Salmonella, and Shigella are known TLR2 agonists with established systemic and mucosal immune adjuvanticity. Early work indicated that the FomA porin from Fusobacterium nucleatum has immune adjuvant activity in mice. Using a purified recombinant FomA, we have verified its immune stimulatory properties and have defined a role for TLR2 signaling in its in vitro and in vivo activity. FomA induces interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion and NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity in HEK cells expressing TLR2, IL-6 secretion, and cell surface upregulation of CD86 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II in primary B cells from wild-type mice, but it fails to activate cells from TLR2 knockout mice. Accordingly, the immune adjuvant activity of FomA is also TLR2 dependent. In a mouse model of immunization with ovalbumin (OVA), FomA induces enhanced production of OVA-specific IgM and IgG, including IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies, as well as enhanced secretion of IL-10 and IL-6, consistent with a Th2-type adjuvant effect. We also observe a moderate production of anti-FomA antibodies, suggesting that FomA is also immunogenic, a quality that is also TLR2 dependent. Therefore, modulation of host immune responses by FomA may be effective for targeting general host immunity not only to pathogens (as a novel TLR2 adjuvant) but also to F. nucleatum itself (as an antigen), expanding its use as a self-adjuvanted antigen in an immunization strategy against polymicrobial infections, including those by F. nucleatum.
TI  - [Impact of periodontal disease on arterial pressure in diabetic mice].
AB  - Diabetes-driven cardiovascular diseases represent a high challenge for developed  countries. Periodontal disease is strictly linked to the aforementioned diseases, due to its Gram negative-driven inflammation. Thus, we investigated the effects of periodontal disease on arterial pressure during the development of diabetes in mice. To this aim, C57BL/6 female mice were colonized with pathogens of periodontal tissue (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum) for 1month, whereas another group of mice did not undergo the colonization. Subsequently, all mice were fed a high-fat carbohydrate-free diet for 3months. Then, arterial pressure was measured in vivo and a tomodensitometric analysis of mandibles was realized as well. Our results show increased mandibular bone-loss induced by colonization with periopathogens. In addition, periodontal infection augmented glucose-intolerance and systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, parameters already known to be affected by a fat-diet. In conclusion, we show here that periodontal disease amplifies metabolic troubles and deregulates arterial pressure, emerging as a new axis of metabolic investigation.
TI  - Microbial diversity in failed endodontic root-filled teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent/secondary infections of human root canals play an important role in the failure of endodontic treatment. This study used 16S rRNA sequencing to assess microbial diversity in root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 15 teeth with persistent intraradicular infections, and the 16S rRNA of all present bacteria were amplified by PCR, followed by cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicons. RESULTS: All sample extracts were positive for PCR amplification using the universal 16S rRNA gene primers. Negative control reactions yielded no amplicons. Sixty-five phylotypes belonging to seven phyla were identified from 760 clones; a mean of 9.4 phylotypes were detected in each sample (range 3 - 15). Twenty-eight phylotypes were detected in more than one sample, revealing a high inter-sample variability. Parvimonas micra (60%, 9/15), Solobacterium moore (47%, 7/15), Dialister invisus (33%, 5/15), Enterococcus faecalis (33%, 5/15), Filifactor alocis (27%, 4/15), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (27%, 4/15) were the prevalent species. Nineteen as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were identified, comprising a substantial proportion of the bacteria in many cases. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent intraradicular infections were present in all root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. The current observations reveal new candidate endodontic pathogens, including as-yet-uncultivated bacteria and phylotypes that may participate in the mixed infections associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Porphyromonas spp. and Fusobacterium spp. in dogs with and without periodontitis.
AB  - The occurrence of Porphyromonas gulae, Porphyromonas macacae, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium canifelinum in subgingival plaque from dogs with and without periodontitis as well as their antimicrobial susceptibility were evaluated. From 50 dogs with periodontitis were identified 38 P. gulae, 8 P. macacae, 26 F. nucleatum and 15 F. canifelinum, and from 50 dogs without periodontitis were identified 15 P. gulae, 12 F. nucleatum and 11 F. canifelinum. All strains were susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested, however, different resistance rates to clarithromycin, erythromycin and metronidazole among strains were observed. The role of P. gulae, P. macacae, F. nucleatum and F. canifelinum in periodontal disease of household pets needs to be defined to a better prevention and treatment of the canine periodontitis.
TI  - Neutrophil superoxide production in the presence of cigarette smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine.
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of cigarette smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine on lucigenin-detectable neutrophil superoxide production. MATERIALS & METHODS: Neutrophils from periodontally healthy individuals were treated with aqueous smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine, prior to stimulation or at the same time as stimulation with Fusobacterium nucleatum, IgG-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Superoxide generation was determined by lucigenin chemiluminescence. RESULTS: Smoke extract induced superoxide release from neutrophils (p <0.0001) in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, superoxide generation by neutrophils in response to pathologically relevant stimuli was inhibited by pre-treatment with smoke extract (p <0.01). This inhibition did not require the continued presence of the extract. A similar reduction in stimulated superoxide production by smoke extract was detected when neutrophils were simultaneously exposed to the extract and stimuli. Nicotine and cotinine (0-10 mug/ml) had no effect on superoxide release from unstimulated or stimulated neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: Stable water-soluble components of cigarette smoke directly induce superoxide generation by otherwise unstimulated neutrophils, but reduce superoxide responses of cells to pathologically relevant stimuli. These data suggest potential neutrophil-mediated mechanisms by which smoking may initiate and maintain oxidative stress at periodontally healthy sites and participate in disease progression, by reducing innate immune responses.
TI  - The role of coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum on the host response to mixed infection.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the role of coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum on the virulence of the mixed infection in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibition of coaggregation was carried out using lactose. In vitro, inhibition of coaggregation was verified using a coaggregation assay. In vivo, the virulence of the mixed infection, with and without coaggregation, was examined in a model of experimental periodontitis in mice. The local host response to the mixed infection, with or without coaggregation, was examined using the subcutaneous chamber model of infection. RESULTS: Lactose inhibited the coaggregation between P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum at all the tested concentrations (1-0.0625 M). Surprisingly, the addition of lactose to the mixed infection increased the severity of experimental periodontitis (as measured by alveolar bone loss) compared with mixed infection with coaggregating bacteria. The addition of lactose to the mixed infection resulted in mild attenuation of TNFalpha and IL-1beta levels. In addition, inhibition of coaggregation resulted in inhibition of the phagocytosis of F. nucleatum and augmentation of the phagocytosis of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum to coaggregate may limit their ability to induce experimental periodontitis in a mixed infection model. Moreover, there is a shift in the phagocytosis pattern of the bacteria with the annulment of coaggregeaiton, with a reduction in F. nucleatum phagocytosis and amplification of P. gingivalis phagocytosis. The increased virulence of the mixed infection without coaggregation may surprisingly lay in the sustention of F. nucleatum in the infected sites.
TI  - Relationship between oral anaerobic bacteria and otitis media with effusion.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study hypothesing the translocation of oral bacteria from oropharynx into the middle ear cavity may be involved in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME), we aimed to investigate the presence and similarity of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola in saliva, nasopharyngeal secretion and the middle ear effusion samples from the children with OME. METHODS: Totally 20 children with OME undergoing myringotomy and ventilation tube placement were attended. Stimulated saliva samples were collected after otorhinolaryngological and oral examinations were done. The middle ear effusion and nasopharyngeal secretions were collected during the operations. The presence of F. nucleatum and T. denticola were detected using 16SrRNA-based PCR. The clonal similarities of the bacteria were detected in the samples which the same bacteria had been detected in each samples of the same child. After DNA sequencing, clonal similarity was determined by 16SrRNA gene clone library analysis. The sequences from each clone were compared with similar sequences of reference organisms by FASTA search. RESULTS: T. denticola was detected only in four (20%) saliva and in one (5%) nasopharyngeal sample. F. nucleatum was detected in 11 (55%) saliva, eight (40%) nasopharyngeal and six (30%) middle ear effusion samples. Sequences from F.nucleatum clones derived from three different anatomic sites within patients were similar in 33% of OME patients, indicating their genetic relatedness. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria involved in this process most likely originate from the oropharynx since they show a close genetic relatedness with their oropharyngeal counterparts.
TI  - Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in a 10-year-old boy, caused by Fusobacterium  nucleatum, diagnosed with PCR/16S ribosomal bacterial DNA amplification.
AB  - A 10-year-old boy presented with an atypical non-febrile septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. He was unresponsive to routine antibiotic treatment with flucloxacillin/gentamicin as the pain and fluid collection increased. Synovial fluid cultures are negative and gram stain remained negative. Only after PCR/16S ribosomal bacterial DNA amplification a Fusobacterium nucleatum could be detected, and antibiotic therapy switched to clindamycin with rapid response. Septic osteomyelitis and arthritis are relatively rare but important infections in children needing prompt treatment, and should be considered when a child complaints about joint or bone pain without prior recent trauma. Skin bacteria are the most prevalent causative organisms, whereas Fusobacteria or other anaerobic, Gram-negative microorganisms are very seldom encountered. If cultures remain negative and the patients responds insufficiently to empiric treatment, PCR/16S ribosomal bacterial DNA amplification can be useful to detect the causative microorganisms.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Human salivary cystatin SA exhibits antimicrobial effect against Aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Healthy subjects who do not have Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity may possess factors in saliva that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against the bacterium. The aim of this study was to identify and purify proteins from saliva of healthy subjects that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans and test the same against the bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Saliva from 10 healthy volunteers was tested individually for its anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans activity. Among the 10 subjects, eight demonstrated anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans activity. Saliva was collected from one healthy volunteer who demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans. After clarifying the saliva, it was subjected to an affinity chromatography column with A. actinomycetemcomitans. The proteins bound to A. actinomycetemcomitans were eluted from the column and identified using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Among other proteins that bound to A. actinomycetemcomitans, which included lactoferrin, immunoglobulin A and kallikrein, cystatin SA was observed in significantly higher concentrations, and this was purified from the eluate. The purified cystatin SA was tested at different concentrations for its ability to kill A. actinomycetemcomitans in a 2 h cell killing assay. The bacteria were also treated with a proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin, to clarify whether the antimicrobial effect of cystatin SA was related to its protease inhibitory function. Cystatin SA was also tested for its ability to prevent binding of A. actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells (BECs) in an A. actinomycetemcomitans-BEC binding assay. RESULTS: Cystatin SA (0.1 mg/mL) demonstrated a statistically significant antimicrobial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans. The effect of cystatin SA decreased with lower concentrations, with 0.01 mg/mL showing no effect. The addition of monoclonal cystatin SA antibodies to the purified sample completely negated the antimicrobial effect. Treatment of A. actinomycetemcomitans with leupeptin resulted in no antimicrobial effect, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of cystatin SA is independent of its protease inhibitory function. A. actinomycetemcomitans pretreated with cystatin SA showed reduced binding to BECs, suggesting a potential role for cystatin SA in decreasing the colonization of A. actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that cystatin SA demonstrates antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathogen A. actinomycetemcomitans, and future studies determining the mechanism of action are necessary. The study also shows the ability of cystatin SA to reduce significantly the binding of A. actinomycetemcomitans to BECs.
TI  - Effect of azithromycin, as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment, on microbiological parameters and gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - Emingil G, Han B, Ozdemir G, Tervahartiala T, Vural C, Atilla G, Baylas H, Sorsa  T. The effect of azithromycin, as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment, on microbiological parameters and gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers in generalized aggressive periodontitis. J Periodont Res 2012; 47: 729-739. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S Background and Objective: To study the effectiveness of azithromycin in combination with nonsurgical periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiological parameters, and on the MMP-8 and TIMP-1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid, over a 6-mo time-period in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. They were randomly assigned to azithromycin or placebo groups (500 mg once daily for 3 d). Probing depth, clinical attachment levels, presence of bleeding on probing and plaque were recorded. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained from one single-rooted tooth, while microbiological samples were obtained from two single-rooted teeth, all with a probing depth of >/= 6 mm. Microbiological parameters were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and total bacteria. Gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers were determined by immunofluorometric assay and ELISA. RESULTS: All clinical parameters improved, and microbiological parameters and gingival crevicular fluid MMP-8 levels significantly decreased, over the 6-mo period (p < 0.05); both groups demonstrated similar improvements. The azithromycin group presented a higher percentage of deep pockets resolved (probing depth reduction of >/= 3 mm from baseline) compared with the placebo group at 1 mo (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive azithromycin therapy provides no additional benefit over nonsurgical periodontal treatment on clinical parameters, microbiological parameters and gingival crevicular fluid biochemical markers investigated in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
TI  - Systemic antibiotics and debridement of peri-implant mucositis. A randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This RCT compared non-surgical treatment of peri-implant mucositis with or without systemic antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight subjects received non-surgical debridement with or without systemic Azithromax ((R)) (4 days), and were followed during 6 months. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method was used to analyse the microbiological material. RESULTS: Five subjects were excluded due to antibiotic medication during follow-up. At baseline,1 and 3 months no group differences were found. Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate differences in probing pocket depths (PPD) values at 6 months (Mean diff PPD: 0.5 mm, SE: +/-0.4 mm, 95% CI: -0.2, 1.3, p = 0.16). Mean% implant bleeding decreased between baseline and month 6 from 82.6% to 27.3% in the test, and from 80.0% to 47.5% in the control group (p < 0.02). Throughout the study, no study group differences in bacterial counts were found. CONCLUSION: No short-term differences were found between study groups. The clinical improvements observed at 6 months may be attributed to improvements in oral hygiene. The present study does not provide evidence for the use of systemic antibiotics in treatment of peri-implant mucositis.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and Tannerella forsythia induce synergistic alveolar bone loss in a mouse periodontitis model.
AB  - Tannerella forsythia is strongly associated with chronic periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to tooth loss. Fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic pathogen, is thought to promote dental plaque formation by serving as a bridge bacterium between early- and late-colonizing species of the oral cavity. Previous studies have shown that F. nucleatum species synergize with T. forsythia during biofilm formation and pathogenesis. In the present study, we showed that coinfection of F. nucleatum and T. forsythia is more potent than infection with either species alone in inducing NF-kappaB activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytic cells and primary murine macrophages. Moreover, in a murine model of periodontitis, mixed infection with the two species induces synergistic alveolar bone loss, characterized by bone loss which is greater than the additive alveolar bone losses induced by each species alone. Further, in comparison to the single-species infection, mixed infection caused significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the gingivae and osteoclastic activity in the jaw bones. These data show that F. nucleatum subspecies and T. forsythia synergistically stimulate the host immune response and induce alveolar bone loss in a murine experimental periodontitis model.
TI  - Serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to AD compared with the antibody levels in control subjects. METHODS: Serum samples from 158 participants in the Biologically Resilient Adults in Neurological Studies research program at the University of Kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin G antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia. All 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. In all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of follow-up. Antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with AD at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with MCI at baseline draw and after conversion using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. AD and MCI participants were not directly compared. Linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. RESULTS: Antibody levels to F nucleatum and P intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in the patients with AD compared with controls. These results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of AD onset/progression. Additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and AD and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.
TI  - Bacterial and inflammatory behavior of implants in the early healing phase of chronic periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the pattern of early bacterial colonization at implants and  teeth in patients with a history of chronic periodontitis compared with a group of healthy subjects. Furthermore, the presence of host-derived markers at teeth and implants in the two subject groups was determined. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Subgingival and submucosal plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples from 37 nonsubmerged healing dental implants and the deepest tooth sites per quadrant were analyzed 2 to 5 months after implant insertion. The presence of periodontal pathogens was assessed by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Further, the levels of interleukin (IL)-1Beta, IL-8, and IL-10; secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor; and the neutrophil elastase activity were determined. RESULTS: Eleven patients with chronic periodontitis and 13 subjects without periodontitis were recruited for this study. Bacterial species associated with periodontitis were detectable at both the teeth and implants. The presence was always higher in the chronic periodontitis group; the difference was significant for Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans at both the implants and teeth. The levels of IL-1Beta were higher at teeth than at implants; in contrast, more IL-10 was measured at the implants. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that (1) dental implants inserted in periodontally compromised patients are colonized with periodontal pathogens within the first weeks of healing; (2) inflammatory markers (IL-1Beta) are present in higher levels at teeth as compared with implants, whereas at implants, anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) might play the important role; and (3) the importance of periodontal treatment prior to implant insertion to reduce bacterial load and inflammation should be emphasized.
TI  - Oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Through HSCT, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. The contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in HSCT recipients. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 49 adult HSCT recipients. Twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. Samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the Gram-negative bacteria: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola; and the yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. Explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (GEE) technique. RESULTS: None of the samples was positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans, while F. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). C. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas C. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. Multivariate GEE analyses identified P. gingivalis, P. micra, T. denticola, F. nucleatum, C. glabrata, and C. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that P. gingivalis in particular, but also P. micra, T. denticola, F. nucleatum, C. glabrata, and C. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative oral mucositis in patients undergoing HSCT.
TI  - Quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  - Anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as Treponema denticola, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. We measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at different stages of Korean chronic periodontal diseases. We divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (G), moderate periodontitis (P1), severe periodontitis (P2), and normal individuals (N) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. We used real-time PCR with TaqMan probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of periodontitis. Bacterial levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. These results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages of periodontitis.
TI  - Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  - High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.
TI  - Fretibacterium fastidiosum gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - SGP1(T), a strain belonging to a lineage of the phylum Synergistetes with no previously cultivated representatives was subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. For good growth the strain was dependent on co-culture with, or extracts from, selected other oral bacteria. Cells of strain SGP1(T) were asaccharolytic and major amounts of acetic acid and moderate amounts of propionic acid were produced as end products of metabolism in peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth supplemented with a filtered cell sonicate of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586(T) (25 %, v/v). Hydrogen sulphide was produced and gelatin was weakly hydrolysed. The major cellular fatty acids were C(14 : 0), C(18 : 0) and C(16 : 0). The DNA G+C content of strain SGP1(T) was 63 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length 16S rRNA gene showed that strain SGP1(T) represented a novel group within the phylum Synergistetes. A novel species in a new genus, Fretibacterium fastidiosum gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain of Fretibacterium fastidiosum is SGP1(T) ( = DSM 25557(T) = JCM 16858(T)).
TI  - Butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  - Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. However, it remains unclear if SCFAs from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. This study investigated whether SCFAs-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. Cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. Apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of DNA fragmentation and using an MTS assay kit, respectively. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas Prevotella nigrescens and Prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the THP-1 and U937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. Healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. Gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in P. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mM) and F. nucleatum (36.0 mM) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in P. nigrescens and P. intermedia. These results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.
TI  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae preceding Lemierre's syndrome due to Fusobacterium nucleatum complicated by acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis in an immunocompetent host.
AB  - We report an unusual case of Lemierre's syndrome due to a rare species of Fusobacterium, that is, Fusobacterium nucleatum preceded by Mycoplasma pneumoniae pharyngitis and followed later by Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis.
TI  - Direct recognition of Fusobacterium nucleatum by the NK cell natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46 aggravates periodontal disease.
AB  - Periodontitis is a common human chronic inflammatory disease that results in the  destruction of the tooth attachment apparatus and tooth loss. Although infections with periopathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) are essential for inducing periodontitis, the nature and magnitude of the disease is determined by the host's immune response. Here, we investigate the role played by the NK killer receptor NKp46 (NCR1 in mice), in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Using an oral infection periodontitis model we demonstrate that following F. nucleatum infection no alveolar bone loss is observed in mice deficient for NCR1 expression, whereas around 20% bone loss is observed in wild type mice and in mice infected with P. gingivalis. By using subcutaneous chambers inoculated with F. nucleatum we demonstrate that immune cells, including NK cells, rapidly accumulate in the chambers and that this leads to a fast and transient, NCR1-dependant TNF-alpha secretion. We further show that both the mouse NCR1 and the human NKp46 bind directly to F. nucleatum and we demonstrate that this binding is sensitive to heat, to proteinase K and to pronase treatments. Finally, we show in vitro that the interaction of NK cells with F. nucleatum leads to an NCR1-dependent secretion of TNF-alpha. Thus, the present study provides the first evidence that NCR1 and NKp46 directly recognize a periodontal pathogen and that this interaction influences the outcome of F. nucleatum-mediated periodontitis.
TI  - Adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (AgP), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in AgP patients. METHODS: Twenty-four AgP subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling (SC) and were then randomly assigned to SRP with systemic azithromycin or placebo. Subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after SC, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following SRP. Microbiological analysis was performed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after SC were similar in the 2 groups. When subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after SC were observed for Actinomyces gerencseriae, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Treponema denticola. During the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. For instance, Actinomyces israelli, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus gordonii, C. ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young AgP subjects compared to placebo. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Specificity of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. Because of observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic LPS, the authors hypothesized that LL-37 had specificity to neutralize such LPS activity. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate the LPS-neutralizing activity of LL-37 to various periodontopathogenic LPS in interleukin-8 (IL-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. METHODS: Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) and gingival fibroblasts (GF) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. After cell confluence in 24-well plates, LPS (10 mug/mL) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without LL-37 (10 mug/mL). After 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in IL-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: All periodontopathogenic LPS statistically significantly induced IL-8 production in both PDLF and GF (P <0.01). After neutralization with LL-37, both PDLF and GF showed a statistically significant reduction in IL-8 production compared with LPS-treated groups without LL-37 (P <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in IL-8 production in PDLF appeared to be higher than in GF. In addition, the percentage of reduction in IL-8 production varied considerably according to each periodontopathogenic LPS. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic LPS-induced IL-8 production in both PDLF and GF. Its LPS-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic LPS and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within LPS between different genera.
TI  - Human neutrophil defensins and their effect on epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of the present study include: 1) to localize human neutrophil defensin-1 (HNP-1) through HNP-3 in gingiva and in neutrophil extract-treated epithelial cell monolayers; 2) to determine the effects of HNP-1 on the epithelial cell viability, attachment, and spreading; and 3) to analyze the effect of HNP-1 on the bacterial adherence to epithelial cells. METHODS: For localization of HNP-1 through HNP-3 in gingival tissue and in preincubated cell monolayers, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical methods were used. Viability and proliferation of epithelial cells were determined with commercial kits after incubating the keratinocytes with different HNP-1 concentrations (low, 1 to 5 mug/mL; moderate, 10 mug/mL; high, 20 to 50 mug/mL). Attachment and spreading of keratinocytes on fibronectin-coated surfaces in the presence of HNP-1 were evaluated under microscope. Attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC25586 and Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611 on keratinocytes preincubated with HNP-1 were determined with a standard antibiotic test. RESULTS: HNP-1 through HNP-3 localized in the junctional epithelium of clinically healthy gingiva and in the pocket epithelium of gingiva with periodontitis. When keratinocyte monolayers were incubated with neutrophil extracts, HNP-1 through HNP-3 were bound to the periphery of the growing cell colonies. In low HNP-1 concentrations, the keratinocyte proliferation enhanced. Moderate and high concentrations of HNP-1 increased the cellular death significantly. HNP-1 increased the attachment and spreading of keratinocytes on fibronectin-coated surfaces and bacterial attachment to keratinocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: HNP-1 plays a role in the integrity of keratinocytes by stimulating their proliferation, attachment, and spreading, whereas higher doses increase the bacterial attachment and keratinocyte death.
TI  - Giant frontal mucocele complicated by subdural empyema: treatment of a rare association.
AB  - Giant frontal mucocele (GFM) is an extremely rare cause of frontal lobe syndrome. Subdural empyema (SDE) is an uncommon complication of paranasal sinisutis, for which craniotomy and decompressive craniotomy are the most effective surgical procedures. A 54-year-old man was brought unconscious to the emergency room where recurrent generalized seizures occurred. Heroine abuse, HCV-related hepatitis, prolonged antibiotic therapy for treatment of purulent rhinorrhea, along with recent personality changes were reported. High white blood cell count, pansinusitis, GFM, SDE and cerebritis were documented. The patient underwent bifrontal craniotomy in emergency, extensive drilling of the inner aspect of the frontal bone, surgical toilet of the enlarged frontal sinus and its "cranialization". Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated and antibiotic therapy was started intravenously and then continued orally for 3 months. 2 years later the patient has recovered, though minor signs of frontal lobe syndrome persist. To the authors knowledge, this is the first case of GFM with SDE reported in the literature. Although decompressive craniectomy is advocated in extreme conditions, as in this case, "internal decompressive craniectomy", obtained with craniotomy and cranialization of the frontal sinuses, is strongly advocated in cases of SDE associated with megasinuses.
TI  - Identification of oral bacterial DNA in synovial fluid of patients with arthritis with native and failed prosthetic joints.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the presence of bacterial DNA in synovial fluids of native or clinically aseptically failed prosthetic joints from patients having periodontal disease and arthritis to determine whether there is bacterial spread from the oral cavity to the joints. METHODS: A total of 36 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among these, 11 were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 25 were diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA). Eight patients with OA and 1 patient with RA had failed prostheses. Synovial fluid was aspirated from the affected hip or knee joint. Pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected, followed by clinical periodontal examination. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the collected synovial fluid and dental plaque samples were followed by polymerase chain reactions and DNA sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Of the 36 patients, bacterial DNA was detected in the synovial fluid samples from 5 patients (13.9%): 2 with RA (1 native and 1 failed prosthetic joints) and 3 with OA (1 native and 2 failed prosthetic joints). Of these 5 patients, 2 were diagnosed with periodontitis and had identical bacterial clones (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Serratia proteamaculans, respectively) detected in both the synovial fluid and the dental plaque samples. Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent, detected in 4 of the 5 positive samples. No cultures were done and no patients were treated with antibiotics or developed clinical infection. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings of bacterial DNA in the synovial fluid suggest the possibility of organisms translocating from the periodontal tissue to the synovium. We suggest that patients with arthritis or failed prosthetic joints be examined for the presence of periodontal diseases and be treated accordingly.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of MTAD and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTAD in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. METHODS: The survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with MTAD, MTAN (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and MTADN (nisin in combination with doxycycline). The survival rates of Enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the normal physiological state under MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Porphyromonas gingivalis after MTAD and MTADN treatment. RESULTS: L. fermenti, L. paracasei, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii, and Peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to MTADN and MTAN than to MTAD. MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN showed a rapid antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN as the control E. faecalis. Furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in A. naeslundii and L. paracasei presented significant rupture, and P. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after MTADN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. Therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.
TI  - Characterization of microbiota of root canal-treated teeth with posttreatment disease.
AB  - This study evaluated the microbiota of root canals undergoing retreatment. The most prevalent taxa detected by checkerboard included Propionibacterium species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococci, and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. Quantitative real-time PCR detected Enterococcus faecalis and streptococci in 38% and 41% of the cases, comprising 9.76% and 65.78% of the total bacterial counts, respectively. The findings call into question the status of E. faecalis as the main pathogen and suggest that other species can be candidate pathogens associated with persistent/secondary endodontic infections.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the effects of different photoablative laser irradiation protocols on the gingiva of periodontopathic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode GaAs, Er:YAG, Nd:YAG, and CO(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. BACKGROUND DATA: Substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. Small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial ICAM-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: High DNA levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, and Ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. Nd:YAG and diode lasers were capable of eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. They also reduced ICAM-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. Conversely, Er:YAG lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas CO(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. Nd:YAG and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum GroEL induces risk factors of atherosclerosis in human microvascular endothelial cells and ApoE(-/-) mice.
AB  - Infection and inflammation are risk factors in the initiation and progression of  atherosclerosis. Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammations of the oral cavity, and has been reported to be associated with systemic disease. In this study, we evaluated whether the heat-shock protein GroEL of Fusobacterium nucleatum, one of the most prevalent bacteria in periodontitis, induces factors that predispose to atherosclerosis in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. GroEL induced the expression of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 as well as cell adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin. GroEL induced the activity of tissue factor and reduced the activity of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Foam cell formation was induced by GroEL. GroEL-injected ApoE(-/-) mice showed significant atherosclerotic lesion progression compared with control mice. Serum levels of risk factors for atherosclerosis such as interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and low-density lipoprotein were increased in GroEL-injected ApoE(-/-) mice compared with control mice, whereas serum levels of high-density lipoprotein were decreased. We could detect significantly higher levels of anti-F. nucleatum GroEL antibody in serum and F. nucleatum DNA in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontitis than in that from healthy subjects. Our results indicate that the host response to the GroEL of periodontal pathogens like F. nucleatum may be a mechanism involved in atherosclerosis, supporting the association of periodontitis and systemic infection.
TI  - Regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. A randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - AIM: Comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (DOXY). METHODS: In each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (EMD), EMD plus filler or membrane at two centres. By random assignment patients received either 200 mg DOXY per day or placebo (PLAC) for 7 days after surgery. Prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (PPD) and vertical attachment level (PAL-V) were obtained. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (DOXY: 27; PLAC: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with EMD. Seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete flap closure. In both groups significant (p < 0.001) PPD reduction (DOXY: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; PLAC: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and PAL-V gain (DOXY: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; PLAC: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. However, the differences failed to be statistically significant (PPD: 0.20; p = 0.588; PAL-V: 0.21; p = 0.657). CONCLUSIONS: Two hundred milligram systemic DOXY administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with EMD failed to result in better PPD reduction and PAL-V gain compared with PLAC which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus, random chance.
TI  - Anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in the biofilm formation on voice prostheses: A pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Voice rehabilitation with voice prostheses is a standard therapy in laryngectomized patients. Biofilm formation on the surface of the voice prostheses causes device failure and requires frequent replacements. Studies analyzing the biofilm of voice prostheses have mainly focused on aerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria as an integral part of the biofilms on voice prostheses have not been investigated yet. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective pilot study on the occurrence of anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses. METHODS: Biofilm samples of 15 voice prostheses were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based hybridization method regarding the presence of 11 selected anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens. RESULTS: In 80% of the voice prostheses, at least one and up to 10 of the tested bacteria could be identified. Fusobacterium nucleatum was the pathogen most often present (73%). Other frequently occurring pathogens were Treponema denticola (40%), Tannerella forsythia (33%), and Eikenella corrodens (33%). There was no correlation between the number of identified bacteria and the indwelling times (mean, 127 days; maximum, 344 days; minimum, 22 days). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens have been identified as part of the biofilm formation on the surface of voice prostheses. Those pathogens might be responsible for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced lifetime of the voice prostheses.
TI  - Connective tissue graft plus resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for the treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions: microbiological and immunological results.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It was previously reported the clinical results of placing subgingival resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of this treatment on the subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) inflammatory markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients presenting the combined defect were selected. The defects were treated with either connective tissue graft plus modified glass ionomer restoration (CTG+R) or with connective tissue graft only (CTG). Evaluation included bleeding on probing and probing depth, 5 different bacteria targets in the subgingival plaque assessed at baseline, 45, and 180 days post treatments, and 9 inflammatory mediators were also assessed in the GCF. RESULTS: The levels of each target bacterium were similar during the entire period of evaluation (p > 0.05), both within and between groups. The highest levels among the studied species were observed for the bacterium associated with periodontal health. Additionally, the levels of all cyto/chemokines analyzed were not statistically different between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the presence of subgingival restoration may not interfere with the subgingival microflora and with GCF inflammatory markers analyzed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This approach usually leads to the placement of a subgingival restoration. There is a lack of information about the microbiological and immunological effects of this procedure. The results suggest that this combined approach may be considered as a treatment option for the lesion included in this study.
TI  - Internal decompressive craniectomy with craniotomy: a novel surgical therapy of giant frontal mucocele complicated by subdural empyema.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Giant frontal mucocele (GFM) is an extremely rare cause of frontal  lobe syndrome. Subdural empyema (SDE) is an uncommon complication of paranasal sinisutis, for which craniotomy and decompressive craniotomy are the most effective surgical procedures. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old man was brought unconscious to the Emergency Room where recurrent generalized seizures occurred. Heroine abuse, HCV related hepatitis, prolonged antibiotic therapy for treatment of purulent rhinorrhea, along with recent personality changes, was reported. High white blood cell count, pansinusitis, GFM, SDE and cerebritis were documented. The patient underwent bifrontal craniotomy in emergency, extensive drilling of the inner aspect of the frontal bone, surgical toilette of the enlarged frontal sinus and its "cranialization". Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated and antibiotic therapy was started intravenously and then continued orally for three months. Two years later the patient has recovered, though minor signs of frontal lobe syndrome persist. DISCUSSION: To the Authors knowledge this is the first case of GFM with SDE reported in the literature. Although decompressive craniectomy is advocated in extreme conditions, as in this case, "internal decompressive craniectomy", obtained with craniotomy and cranialization of the frontal sinuses, is strongly advocated in cases of SDE associated with megasinuses.
TI  - Effects of oil drops containing Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 on periodontal health and oral microbiota producing volatile sulfur compounds.
AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of oil drops containing Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 on periodontal health and oral microbiota producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). For this study, 42 subjects were randomly assigned to receive oil samples containing L. salivarius WB21 or a placebo for two weeks. Oral assessment and saliva collection were performed on days 1 and 15. Bacterial analysis was performed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). In both the experimental and placebo groups, the average probing depth, number of periodontal pockets, and the percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) decreased while stimulated salivary flow increased on day 15. BOP was reduced in the experimental group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.010). In the experimental group, total bacterial numbers decreased, and the number of L. salivarius increased. The number of Prevotella intermedia, which is correlated with hydrogen sulfide concentration in mouth air, increased in the placebo group and did not change in the experimental group. T-RFLP analysis found that the peak area proportions representing Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum decreased in the experimental group, although there was no significant change in the bacterial composition. Thus we observed oil drops containing L. salivarius WB21 improved BOP and inhibited the reproduction of total and VSC-producing periodontopathic bacteria compared with the placebo group, but also showed the limit of its efficacy in controlling VSCs producing and periodontal pathogens.
TI  - [Effect of periodontal surgery on the subgingival periodontal microbiota in artificial class III furcation defects: an experimental study in monkeys].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was to longitudinally evaluate the change of prevalence of  five periodontal putative pathogens in the subgingival plaque of artificial class III furcation defects at the three time-points, including before the establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. METHODS: Eighteen chronic infected class III FI defects were created at the mandibular first molars, second molars and second premolars of three adult male Macaca fascicularis. The samples of subgingival plaque were obtained from the subgingival area of furcation defects in buccal and lingual sites before the establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. 36 samples were obtained at one time-points. Five periodontal putative pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Treponema dinticola (Td), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), were detected with 16SrRNA based PCR. RESULTS: 1. The prevalence of Pg, Tf, Td and Fn was gradually increased, from 58.3% to 69.4% to 88.9%, 47,2% to 69.4% to 83.3%, 13.9% to 36.1% to 61.1% (P<0.01), and 69.4% to 91.7% to 91.7% (P<0.05), respectively during the experimental period. The prevalence of Fn was higher than Pg, Tf and Td. The prevalence of Aa was the lowest and no obvious difference among the three samplings(from 25.9% to 13.9% to 33.3%)was detected. 2. The prevalence of more than 3 species simultaneously detected was increased from 38.9% to 61.1% to 83.3% (P <0.01). The red complex (Pg + Tf + Td) was detected from 8.3% to 27.8% to 44.4% (P<0.01) at the different time point. 3. The combined detection frequency of red complex in the inflammatory sites (87.5%), which were histologically defined as inflammatory cells infiltrated in furcation area 6 months post-surgery, and the same sites pre-surgery (62.5%) was more than that in pre-creation of furcation defects (P<0.01). But there were no significant differences compared to that in non inflammatory area (60.0%, 40.0%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria correlated with the severity of local inflammation. The increase of coexistent rate of red complex at the second and third sampling times suggests that the red complex play important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Fn may be a resident bacteria in the subgingival plaque, play a bridge role on the biofilm formation and maturation. Aa may not be a major causative bacteria in the clinical periodontitis.
TI  - The relationship between turbidity of mouth-rinsed water and oral health status.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between turbidity of mouth rinsed water and oral health status such as dental and periodontal conditions, oral hygiene status, flow rate of saliva and oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 165 patients who visited the Dental Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Oral health status, including dental and periodontal conditions, oral hygiene status and flow rate of saliva, was clinically examined. The turbidity was measured with a turbidimeter. Quantification of Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola and total bacteria levels was performed using real-time PCR. The Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used to explore the associations between the turbidity and oral health parameters. RESULTS: The turbidity showed significant correlations with the number of decayed teeth and deep pockets, the plaque index, extent of tongue coating and Fusobacterium spp, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola and total bacteria levels. In a multiple regression model, the turbidity was negatively associated with the flow rate of saliva and positively associated with the total number of bacteria (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Current findings suggested that turbidity of mouth rinsed water could be used as an indicator to evaluate oral health condition and the amount of bacteria in the oral cavity. In addition, the turbiditimeter appeared as a simple and objective device for screening abnormality of oral health condition at chair side as well as community-based research.
TI  - Association between oral malodour and periodontal disease-related parameters in the general population.
AB  - AIM: To determine the association between halitosis detection and periodontal status in systemically healthy non-smokers and to assess whether halitosis was related to quantities of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the tongue dorsum. METHODS: Periodontal examinations, tongue coating determination, Halimeter(R) readings and organoleptic assessments of mouth odour were performed in 28 chronic periodontitis patients, 23 chronic gingivitis patients and 27 healthy individuals. The quantities of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were determined in tongue specimens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Halitosis was more likely to be detected in patients with periodontitis (OR = 9.2) and gingivitis (OR = 4.6) than in healthy subjects. The posterior tongue odour was similar for all groups; had the highest score of all organoleptic assessments and was significantly correlated with Halimeter(R) scores and the odour of the whole mouth air. Periodontitis patients harboured significantly greater amounts of P. gingivalis on their tongue, yet similar quantities of F. nucleatum compared to gingivitis patients and healthy subjects. The amount of P. gingivalis residing on the tongue dorsum of periodontitis patients was significantly associated with halitosis recordings, while the amount of F. nucleatum was related to tongue coating in healthy controls, which corroborates its role in biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with periodontal disease were at higher risk for halitosis detection than healthy individuals. The posterior portion of the tongue dorsum seems to be an important source of odourous compounds, regardless of periodontal condition. P. gingivalis residing on the tongue of periodontitis patients may play a key role in oral malodour production.
TI  - Effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. We report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding RNAs is stimulated. In the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. However, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. We also observed a significant upregulation of ABC transport systems and putative transposases. Changes in Clusters of Orthologous Groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of transcription factors were upregulated. Finally, we identified several small noncoding RNAs whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. These results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.
TI  - Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Small subunit rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Template DNA prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial and archaeal genes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the microorganisms present. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11 phyla, including members of the uncultivable TM7, SR1, and Chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. Dialister invisus, Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. Dialister invisus and F nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms. The archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. Several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.
TI  - Azithromycin as an adjunctive treatment of generalized severe chronic periodontitis: clinical, microbiologic, and biochemical parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examines the efficacy of azithromycin in combination with  non-surgical periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiologic parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) matrix metalloproteinases-8 (MMP-8) levels over 6 months in patients with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (CP). METHODS: Twenty-eight of 36 patients with severe generalized CP were included in this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. They were randomly assigned to azithromycin or placebo groups (500 mg, once daily for 3 days). Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level, dichotomous presence or absence of supragingival plaque accumulation, and bleeding on probing were recorded. GCF samples were obtained from one single-rooted tooth with PD >/= 6 mm, whereas microbiologic samples were collected from two single-rooted teeth with PD >/= 6 mm. Microbiologic parameters were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and total bacteria. GCF MMP-8 levels were determined by immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Azithromycin and placebo groups demonstrated similar but significant improvements in all clinical parameters (P <0.05). A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia, and total bacteria significantly decreased over the 6-month period in both groups, whereas F. nucleatum was significantly reduced in all visits in the azithromycin group, with the levels also being lower compared with those of the placebo group (P <0.05). The azithromycin and placebo groups exhibited significant reduction in GCF MMP-8 levels at the post-treatment visit and at 2 weeks (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: On the basis of the present findings, it can be concluded that adjunctive azithromycin provides no additional benefit over non-surgical periodontal treatment on parameters investigated in patients with severe generalized CP.
TI  - Reactivation of latent HIV-1 by a wide variety of butyric acid-producing bacteria.
AB  - Latently infected cells harbor human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA copies integrated in heterochromatin, allowing persistence of transcriptionally silent proviruses. It is widely accepted that hypoacetylation of histone proteins by histone deacetylases (HDACs) is involved in maintaining the HIV-1 latency by repressing viral transcription. HIV-1 replication can be induced from latently infected cells by environmental factors, such as inflammation and co-infection with other microbes. It is known that a bacterial metabolite butyric acid inhibits catalytic action of HDAC and induces transcription of silenced genes including HIV-1 provirus. There are a number of such bacteria in gut, vaginal, and oral cavities that produce butyric acid during their anaerobic glycolysis. Since these organs are known to be the major site of HIV-1 transmission and its replication, we explored a possibility that explosive viral replication in these organs could be ascribable to butyric acid produced from anaerobic resident bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that the culture supernatant of various bacteria producing butyric acid could greatly reactivate the latently-infected HIV-1. These bacteria include Fusobacterium nucleatum (commonly present in oral cavity, and gut), Clostridium cochlearium, Eubacterium multiforme (gut), and Anaerococcus tetradius (vagina). We also clarified that butyric acid in these culture supernatants could induce histone acetylation and HIV-1 replication by inhibiting HDAC. Our observations indicate that butyric acid-producing bacteria could be involved in AIDS progression by reactivating the latent HIV provirus and, subsequently, by eliminating such bacterial infection may contribute to the prevention of the AIDS development and transmission.
TI  - Treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like proteinase (CTLP) integrates spirochaetes within oral microbial communities.
AB  - Treponema denticola is found ubiquitously in the human oral cavity and is mainly  associated with bacterial communities implicated in the establishment and development of periodontal disease. The ability to become integrated within biofilm communities is crucial to the growth and survival of oral bacteria, and involves inter-bacterial coaggregation, metabolic cooperation, and synergy against host defences. In this article we show that the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (CTLP), found within a high-molecular-mass complex on the cell surface, mediates adherence of T. denticola to other potential periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Parvimonas micra. Proteolytic activity per se did not appear to be required for the interactions, and expression of the major outer-sheath protein (Msp) was not necessary, except for binding Parv. micra. Biofilms of densely packed cells and matrix, up to 40 microm in depth, were formed between T. denticola and P. gingivalis on salivary pellicle, with T. denticola cells enriched in the upper layers. Expression of CTLP, but not Msp, was critical for dual-species biofilm formation with P. gingivalis. T. denticola did not form dual-species biofilms with any of the other three periodontal bacterial species under various conditions. Synergy between T. denticola and P. gingivalis was also shown by increased inhibition of blood clotting, which was CTLP-dependent. The results demonstrate the critical role of CTLP in interactions of T. denticola with other oral micro-organisms, leading to synergy in microbial community development and host tissue pathogenesis.
TI  - Detection of Fusobacterium nucleatum in chorionic tissues of high-risk pregnant women.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to investigate the existence of a periodontopathic bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in chorionic tissues of pregnant women, and the effects of F. nucleatum on human chorion-derived cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral and chorionic tissue samples were collected from 24 high-risk pregnant women and 15 normal pregnant women. The presence of F. nucleatum in the samples was detected using polymerase chain reaction. Chorion-derived cells and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 or TLR-4 gene-silenced chorion-derived cells were stimulated with F. nucleatum lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Interleukin (IL)-6 and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in the culture supernatants were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: F. nucleatum was detected in all oral samples and seven chorionic tissues from the high-risk pregnant women, but was not detected in chorionic tissues from the normal pregnant women. F. nucleatum LPS significantly increased IL-6 and CRH secretion by chorion-derived cells. The F. nucleatum LPS-induced IL-6 and CRH levels were significantly reduced in TLR-2 or TLR-4 gene-silenced chorion-derived cells. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that F. nucleatum is detected in chorionic tissues of high-risk pregnant women, but not in chorionic tissues of normal pregnant women, and that F. nucleatum induces IL-6 and CRH production via both TLR-2 and TLR-4 in chorion-derived cells.
TI  - Oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. However, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. This report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. Monoinfection biofilms were developed with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. Biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, OKF4, for up to 24h. Gro-1alpha, IL1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, TGFalpha, Fractalkine, MIP-1alpha, and IP-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. P. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines, except MIP-1alpha. Generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited Gro-1alpha, TGFalpha, and Fractalkine production, while F. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10. A. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10. The oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. Moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - Microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in German patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Thirty-three patients with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. Samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. The samples were divided into two parts. One part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees C until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. Forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78 species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. Significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, P < .001) were found for Prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, T forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Veillonella parvula. The first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and V parvula with healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: When compared with healthy controls, the microbial profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. P intermedia/nigrescens, F nucleatum, T forsythia, and T denticola have been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.
TI  - Synergistic effect on biofilm formation between Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga ochracea.
AB  - The formation of dental plaque biofilm by specific Gram-negative rods and spirochetes plays an important role in the development of periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to characterize biofilm formation by Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Coaggregation between F. nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species was determined by visual assay. Biofilm formation was assessed by crystal violet staining. Enhancement of biofilm formation by F. nucleatum via soluble factor of C. ochracea was evaluated by addition of culture supernatant and a two-compartment separated co-culture system. Production of autoinducer-2 by the tested organisms was evaluated using Vibrio harveyi BB170. F. nucleatum strains coaggregated with C. ochracea ATCC 33596 or ONO-26 strains. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine or lysine inhibited coaggregation. Heating or proteinase K treatment of F. nucleatum cells affected coaggregation, whereas the same treatment of C. ochracea cells did not. Co-culture of F. nucleatum with C. ochracea in the same well resulted in a statistically significant increase in biofilm formation. Enhancement of F. nucleatum biofilm formation by a soluble component of C. ochracea was observed using the two-compartment co-culture system (P < 0.05) and confirmed by addition of culture supernatant of C. ochracea (P < 0.01). The present findings indicate that induction of coaggregation and intracellular interaction by release of a diffusible molecule by C. ochracea play a significant role in the formation of biofilm by F. nucleatum and C. ochracea.
TI  - Mucosal invasion by fusobacteria is a common feature of acute appendicitis in Germany, Russia, and China.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate the geographic occurrence of mucosa-invading Fusobacteria in acute appendicitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Carnoy- and formalin-fixated appendices from Germany, Russia, and China were comparatively investigated. Bacteria were detected using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Cecal biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions were used as disease controls. RESULTS: Fusobacteria represented mainly by Fusobacterium nucleatum were the major invasive component in bacterial infiltrates in acute appendicitis but were completely absent in controls. The occurrence of invasive Fusobacteria in Germany, Russia, and China was the same. The detection rate in Carnoy-fixated material was 70-71% and in formalin-fixated material was 30-36%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute appendicitis is a polymicrobial infectious disease in which F. nucleatum and other Fusobacteria play a key role.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm induces epithelial migration in an organotypic model of dento-gingival junction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effects of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) biofilm on epithelial cell proliferation, apoptotic cell death, and basement membrane constituent collagen IV production were examined in an organotypic dento-epithelial (OD-E) model. METHODS: The OD-E model was constructed by seeding keratinocytes on fibroblast-containing collagen gels and by placing tooth pieces on top. A 3-day-old biofilm either a laboratory strain (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 25586) or a clinical strain (Anaerobe Helsinki Negative [AHN] 9508) of F. nucleatum was placed on the top of the model. The coculture was incubated </=24 hours. The expression and localization of Ki-67, caspase-3, and collagen IV were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed epithelial migration and lateral sprouting into the connective tissue matrix in F. nucleatum OD-E cocultures. The proliferation pattern of the in vitro dento-epithelial junction was changed. In controls without bacterial challenge, the Ki-67 expression was abundant in the cells attached to the tooth, whereas in F. nucleatum biofilm-treated cultures, the Ki-67-expressing cells were more often in the connective tissue-facing side of the epithelium. An apoptotic marker caspase-3 was expressed in controls and in F. nucleatum laboratory strain ATCC cocultures throughout the epithelium, in contrast to cultures treated with F. nucleatum clinical strain AHN, in which caspase-3 was absent. Collagen IV stainings were negative in both controls and F. nucleatum cocultures. CONCLUSION: F. nucleatum biofilm coculture with OD-E model causes lateral sprouting of the epithelium with an altered epithelial proliferation pattern, resembling the histologic changes seen in vivo in the early pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
TI  - Clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (RC) system and apical tissues. Data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as RC with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (AAA), are scarce in the literature. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic RC and AAA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. METHODS: Paired samples of RC and AAA exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by PCR for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. The frequency of species was compared between the RC and the AAA samples. A stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. A dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: All samples harbored bacterial DNA. Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Filifactor alocis, and Tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both RC and AAA samples. The selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia. The samples of RC and AAA that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of RC and AAA.
TI  - Cytokine expression in response to root canal infection in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - AIM: To examine cytokine expression profiles during periapical lesion development in response to synergetic human pathogens in a gnotobiotic mouse model. METHODOLOGY: Human strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were inoculated into the root canals of germ-free mice in either mono- or bi-association. Animals were killed 7 and 14 days after infection, and periapical tissues were collected. mRNA expression of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), IL-10, IL-4 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) was assessed using real-time PCR. Levene's test was used to assess the equality of variance of the data, whereas a t-test for independent samples was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between groups (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The mRNA expression of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was up-regulated by F. nucleatum during the acute (day 7) and chronic phase (day 14) of periapical lesion development. However, in bi-infection the expression of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were effectively absent at both time-points. RANKL mRNA expression was down-regulated during dual infection at the chronic phase. As IL-4 expression was similar at both time-points, IL-4 does not appear to be involved in the periapical response to these bacterial strains. IL-10 was up-regulated during the chronic phase by mono-infection with either F. nucleatum or P. prevotii. Dual infection increased TGF-beta mRNA expression on day 7, which paralleled the decrease in IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA levels at the same time-point. F. nucleatum increased TGF-beta mRNA expression during the chronic phase. CONCLUSION: Cytokine profiles depend on the nature of the bacterial challenge. Both TGF-beta and IL-10 appeared to be regulating the proinflammatory cytokine responses at both time-points of the periapical immune response.
TI  - Release of metronidazole from electrospun poly(L-lactide-co-D/L-lactide) fibers for local periodontitis treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to achieve detailed biomaterials characterization of a drug  delivery system for local periodontitis treatment based on electrospun metronidazole-loaded resorbable polylactide (PLA) fibers. METHODS: PLA fibers loaded with 0.1-40% (w/w) MNA were electrospun and were characterized by SEM and DSC. HPLC techniques were used to analyze the release profiles of metronidazole (MNA) from these fibers. The antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring inhibition zones of drug-containing aliquots from the same electrospun fiber mats in an agar diffusion test. Three pathogenic periodontal bacterial strains: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were studied. Cytotoxicity testing was performed with human gingival fibroblasts by: (i) counting viable cells via live/dead staining methods and (ii) by exposing cells directly onto the surface of MNA-loaded fibers. RESULTS: MNA concentration influenced fiber diameters and thus w/w surface areas: diameter being minimal and area maximal at 20% MNA. HPLC showed that these 20% MNA fibers had the fastest initial MNA release. From the third day, MNA release was slower and nearly linear with time. All fiber mats released 32-48% of their total drug content within the first 7 days. Aliquots of media taken from the fiber mats inhibited the growth of all three bacterial strains. MNA released up to the 28th day from fiber mats containing 40% MNA significantly decreased the viability of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis and up to the 2nd day also for the resistant A. actinomycetemcomitans. All of the investigated fibers and aliquots showed excellent cytocompatibility. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that MNA-loaded electrospun fiber mats represent an interesting class of resorbable drug delivery systems. Sustained drug release properties and cytocompatibility suggest their potential clinical applicability for the treatment of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - Investigation and quantification of key periodontal pathogens in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a recognized risk factor for periodontitis. There are conflicting data regarding whether healthy diabetic patients or diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis have an altered subgingival microbiota compared with nondiabetic individuals. The aim of the present study was to detect quantitative differences in selected periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaque of diabetic patients using TaqMan quantitative PCR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with (n=9) or without chronic periodontal disease (n=15) were recruited and matched to nondiabetic control subjects (n=12 periodontally healthy, n=12 chronic periodontitis). Subgingival plaque samples were collected from deep (>4 mm probing depth) and shallow sites (</=3 mm probing depth) using paper points, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were quantified. RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects (69 samples) were recruited. Marked differences were seen in the levels of all three bacterial species, relative to the total bacterial population, according to periodontal health status. Using real-time quantitative PCR, bacterial counts for P. gingivalis were significantly higher in deep pockets of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects compared with periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05) but did not differ significantly between diabetics and nondiabetics. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in all groups in low quantities, and counts did not differ significantly between groups (p>0.05). F. nucleatum was abundant in all groups, with no clear significant differences between groups. P. gingivalis was found in higher quantities in periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05). Statistically significant positive correlations were identified between pocket depth and counts for all three species tested (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis were present in significantly different quantities and proportions in subgingival plaque, according to periodontal disease status. No significant differences were identified between the subgingival microbiota of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients compared with nondiabetic subjects.
TI  - Adhesion of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum on  bioactive TiO(2) surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioactive TiO(2) coatings have been found to enhance fibroblast adhesion and gingival attachment on the titanium surfaces, but no information is available whether the coatings also promote the adhesion of periodontal pathogens. AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate protein adsorption and the adhesion of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) on bioactive TiO2 surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially pure titanium discs (diameter 11.0 mm, grade 2) were coated with sol-gel derived bioactive TiO2 coatings (MetAlive, Vivoxid, Turku, Finland) and preincubated in 1.5 ml PBS/diluted serum/diluted saliva at room temperature to mimic the clinical situation after implantation and to allow serum/saliva proteins to adhere on the substrates. Uncoated titanium discs were used as controls. RESULTS: SDS-PAGE revealed similar protein profiles on bioactive and control titanium substrates. No differences were noticed in Aa or Fn adhesion between bioactive and control titanium. However, serum and saliva conditioning diminished Aa adhesion on both surfaces (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that bioactive TiO2 coating does not promote adhesion of Aa and Fn.
TI  - Gene-Diet Interactions on Colorectal Cancer Risk.
AB  - There has been increasing interest lately in understanding how natural dietary antioxidants affect chemoprevention, and recently, there has been a merging of information about antioxidants, endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), and inflammation. RONS normally serve the cells as second messengers to regulate many of the intracellular signaling cascades that govern multiple cellular activities. However, when the amount of RONS exceeds the cell's ability to metabolize/eliminate them, the cell becomes stressed and acquires genetic and epigenetic aberrations and dysregulated intracellular signaling cascades. In addition, there has been a better understanding of the role of tissue inflammation in the carcinogenesis process. Herein we integrate these fields to explain where RONS arise and how natural dietary antioxidants are principally working through refurbishing pathways that use RONS as second messengers.
TI  - In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Galls of Quercus infectoria Olivier against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - The galls of Quercus infectoria are commonly used in Malay traditional medicine to treat wound infections after childbirth. In India, they are employed traditionally as dental applications such as that in treatment of toothache and gingivitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of galls of Quercus infectoria Olivier against oral bacteria which are known to cause dental caries and periodontitis. Methanol and acetone extracts were screened against two Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). The screening test of antibacterial activity was performed using agar-well diffusion method. Subsequently, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by using twofold serial microdilution method at a concentration ranging between 0.01 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing microtiter wells which showed no changes in colour of the indicator after incubation. Both extracts showed inhibition zones which did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) against each tested bacteria. Among all tested bacteria, S. salivarius was the most susceptible. The MIC ranges for methanol and acetone extracts were the same, between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/mL. The MBC value, for methanol and acetone extracts, was in the ranges 0.31-1.25 mg/mL and 0.31-2.50 mg/mL, respectively. Both extracts of Q. infectoria galls exhibited similar antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. Thus, the galls may be considered as effective phytotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral pathogens.
TI  - Adherence to streptococci facilitates Fusobacterium nucleatum integration into an oral microbial community.
AB  - The development of multispecies oral microbial communities involves complex intra- and interspecies interactions at various levels. The ability to adhere to the resident bacteria or the biofilm matrix and overcome community resistance are among the key factors that determine whether a bacterium can integrate into a community. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a prevalent Gram-negative oral bacterial species that is able to adhere to a variety of oral microbes and has been implicated in playing an important role in the establishment of multispecies oral microbial community. However, the majority of experiments thus far has focused on the physical adherence between two species as measured by in vitro co-aggregation assays, while the community-based effects on the integration of F. nucleatum into multispecies microbial community remains to be investigated. In this study, we focus on community integration of F. nucleatum. We demonstrated using an established in vitro mice oral microbiota (O-mix) that the viability of F. nucleatum was significantly reduced upon addition to the O-mix due to cell contact-dependent induction of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production by oral community. Interestingly, this inhibitory effect was significantly alleviated when F. nucleatum was allowed to adhere to its known interacting partner species (such as Streptococcus sanguinis) prior to addition. Furthermore, this aggregate formation-dependent protection was absent in the F. nucleatum mutant strain DeltaFn1526 that is unable to bind to a number of Gram-positive species. More importantly, this protective effect was also observed during integration of F. nucleatum into a human salivary microbial community (S-mix). These results suggest that by adhering to other oral microbes, F. nucleatum is able to mask the surface components that are recognized by H(2)O(2) producing oral community members. This evasion strategy prevents detection by antagonistic oral bacteria and allows integration into the developing oral microbial community.
TI  - A five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we used 385 K NimbleGene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis). Array hybridization was done with cDNA from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. Single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. These probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude the whole genes from the analysis. Between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. The influence of Streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on S. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. Phenotypically, under the influence of S. mitis an increase in S. mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media pH-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. Employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 S. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a S. mutans mono-species biofilm. Several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. It may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.
TI  - Automated RNA structure prediction uncovers a kink-turn linker in double glycine  riboswitches.
AB  - The tertiary structures of functional RNA molecules remain difficult to decipher. A new generation of automated RNA structure prediction methods may help address these challenges but have not yet been experimentally validated. Here we apply four prediction tools to a class of double glycine riboswitches that can bind two ligands cooperatively. A novel method (BPPalign), RMdetect, JAR3D, and Rosetta 3D modeling give consistent predictions for a new stem P0 and a kink-turn motif. These elements structure the linker between the RNAs' double aptamers. Chemical mapping on the Fusobacterium nucleatum riboswitch with N-methylisatoic anhydride, dimethyl sulfate and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate probing, mutate-and-map studies, and mutation/rescue experiments all provide strong evidence for the structured linker. Under solution conditions that permit rigorous thermodynamic analysis, disrupting this helix-junction-helix structure gives 120- and 6-30-fold poorer dissociation constants for the RNA's two glycine-binding transitions, corresponding to an overall energetic impact of 4.3 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol. Prior biochemical and crystallography studies did not include this critical element due to over-truncation of the RNA. We speculate that several further undiscovered elements are likely to exist in the flanking regions of this and other functional RNAs, and automated prediction tools can play a useful role in their detection and dissection.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of gingivitis in pediatric patients under orthodontic treatment.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between gingival inflammation and changes in bacteria of the gingival sulcus in children in orthodontic treatment with brackets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: this prospective study assessed gingival and plaque index of two groups: children with brackets (Group 1) and without brackets (Group 2). The sample was selected from patients treated at the Faculty of Dentistry, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. Microbiological assessment was performed in every child and all data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: Group 1 showed significantly higher microbiological values and the difference was greater in lower teeth. Comparing the total plaque percentage, it was significantly higher in Group 1. STATISTICS: there was no significant correlation between gingival and plaque indexes in any group. No significant correlation was found between plaque index and bacteria. CONCLUSION: Children using brackets showed significantly higher gingival and plaque indices than children without brackets. No direct relationship was found between the increase in gingival and plaque indices and the presence and quantity of bacteria; therefore it was not possible to identify specific bacteria as responsible for the high gingival index in patients with brackets.
TI  - Predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. This study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six Labrador retrievers. The samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. From the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. Each of the strains was characterized by Gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic growth and API-ZYM test. Eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on DNA sequencing technology. Cross-reactions of DNA probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. RESULTS: Thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. They represented 21 different species, of which six belonged to the genus Porphyromonas. No species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. Porphyromonas crevioricanis and Fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. DNA probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. CONCLUSION: The predominant cultural subgingival flora in dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of microbiota in saliva, supragingival, and subgingival plaque of Chinese adults with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the profiles of periodontopathogenic bacteria in a Chinese population using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four periodontally healthy Chinese subjects and 60 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. qRT-PCR was used to quantify Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia as well as total bacterial counts from 252 samples collected from the saliva, supragingival plaque, and subgingival plaque of all 84 subjects. RESULTS: The detection frequency of A. actinomycetemcomitans was less than 50%. F. nucleatum was detected in all subjects and CP patients had higher bacterial loads than healthy subjects. The median proportion of F. nucleatum was significantly higher in subgingival plaque than in supragingival plaque and saliva. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia had higher detection frequencies and bacterial loads in CP patients than in healthy subjects. The median proportion of P. gingivalis was significantly different among the three intraoral locations in the CP group and its proportion in subgingival plaque was 9.01%. Moreover, strong positive Spearman's correlations were found in A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and P. intermedia counts across the three intraoral locations. CONCLUSION: The presence and bacteria loads of these four bacteria in this Chinese population are similar to those from other populations. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Examination of bacterial detection frequency and loads in Chinese adults may assist microbial studies of periodontal disease and will shed light on periodontal disease diagnosis and treatment using antibiotics in the Chinese population.
TI  - Oral bacterial DNA differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) of periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas  gingivalis (Pg) and Tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human monocytic cells (THP-1) through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with Pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. We investigate inflammatory mediator production in THP-1 cells challenged with Fn and Streptococcus sanguinis (Ss) DNA, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or Pg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are affected by TLR-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). METHODS: THP-1 cells were stimulated with Pg-DNA (100 ng/muL), Fn-DNA (100 ng/muL), Ss-DNA (100 ng/muL), Pg-LPS (10 ng/muL), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/mL). Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Dunnett or Tukey methods and paired t test. A value of P <0.05 was significant. RESULTS: Inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of Ss-DNA (P <0.05). Chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from THP-1 cells with the exception of IL-6 production triggered by whole Fn and Ss (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Differences exist among oral bacterial DNA in inducing immune responses. By altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. Thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - There is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. How lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. To begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases D-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four Gram-negative bacteria and seven Gram-positive bacteria. Exact Kruskal-Wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (P < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D-sphingosine (MBC range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (MBC range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (MBC range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Sapienic acid (MBC range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium striatum, and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Lauric acid (MBC range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except E. coli, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. Hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
TI  - The adhesion of oral bacteria to modified titanium surfaces: role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Modifications of titanium (Ti) implant surfaces have a significant effect on early biofilm formation and the outcome of implant procedures. The aim of this study was to examine the role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces in the adhesion mechanism of oral bacteria to modified Ti surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ti discs with three different types of surface modifications, machined, acid-etched, and acid-etched and blasted, were examined for adhesion of oral bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Following pretreatment of the Ti with ion rich solutions or coating by human serum albumin or fibronectin, bacterial adhesion was examined by scanning electron microscopy and assessed quantitatively by DNA analysis. Ti coating by proteins as well as bacterial adhesion and their interrelationships were further investigated through confocal scanning laser microscopy. RESULTS: Acid-etched and blasted Ti surfaces exhibited significantly higher amounts of bacteria adhesion than the other two surfaces. Calcium was found to serve as a bridging agent in the adhesion process of S. mutans and F. nucleatum to Ti surfaces. Although albumin coating of the Ti reduced the adhesion of S. mutans to all surfaces, it had no influence on the adhesion of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. Coating the Ti with fibronectin enhanced P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial adhesion to Ti surfaces is roughness-dependent, and the adhesion mechanism is influenced by ions and proteins of the initial coating derived from the blood.
TI  - Extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (DNase), the purpose in microbial physiology was unclear. Recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded DNA/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). As NETs have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular DNase activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine whether DNase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. Pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade DNA, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. Following culture on DNA-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and DNase activity related to colony size. RESULTS: Twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex members Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus constellatus, Campylobacter rectus and Prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular DNase activity. Differences in DNase activity were noted, however, when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. Analysis of the activity of secreted DNase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade NETs. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that DNase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. Further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial DNase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
TI  - Signal peptide of FadA adhesin from Fusobacterium nucleatum plays a novel structural role by modulating the filament's length and width.
AB  - FadA, a novel adhesin of periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum is composed of two forms, pre-FadA and mature FadA (mFadA), constituting the functional FadA complex (FadAc). By electron microscopy, we observed that mFadA formed uniformly long and thin filaments, while FadAc formed heterogeneous filaments of varying lengths and widths, as well as "knots". Mutants in signal peptide or in the non-alpha-helical loop retaining heterogeneous structures had binding activity while those forming aggregates or long filaments lost activity. These observations suggest short filaments and knots may be the active forms of FadA. This is the first demonstration that a signal peptide is required for the assembly of a bacterial adhesin.

TI  - Investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  - AIM: To investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens and Capnocytophaga sputigena. METHODOLOGY: Forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. Clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. Qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization (micro-IDent plus; Hain Lifescience, Germany). RESULTS: Extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for P. micra, F. nucleatum and C. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus C. rectus. Significant association was recorded between F. nucleatum-endo and P. micra-endo (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). There was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) C. sputigena-endo and C. sputigena-perio (P = 0.06, Fisher's exact test); (ii) P. micra-endo and P. micra-perio (P = 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with P. micra-endo (P = 0.03, Pearson chi-square test). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that F. nucleatum, P. micra and C. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.
TI  - A case of craniocervical abscess with sinus thrombosis in Lemierre's syndrome.
AB  - A 74-year old gentleman with a cranio-cervical abscess failed to improve after incision and drainage and standard intravenous antibiotic therapy. Imaging demonstrated thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, sigmoid sinus and transverse sinus; and microbiological analysis isolated Fusobacterium nucleatum. The diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome was confirmed, and he was effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics and anti-coagulation.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward Streptococcus oralis, mutans, Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Adhesives used were Corega Ultra((R)), Fixodent Pro Original((R)) and Biotene((R)) Denture Grip. For Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mutans, four tubes of Trypticase Soy Broth 10 mL and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. In addition four tubes of Trypticase Soy Broth 10 mL without any denture adhesive was employed as control. For Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 mL and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 mL without adhesive served as control. All samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. After 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/mL. The results were evaluated with ANOVA on ranked data and Tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. Streptococcus oralis, mutans, Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. Under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. However, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. Corega Ultra((R)) and Biotene((R)) Denture Grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than Fixodent Pro Original((R)).
TI  - Isoflavonoids and coumarins from Glycyrrhiza uralensis: antibacterial activity against oral pathogens and conversion of isoflavans into isoflavan-quinones during purification.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of a supercritical fluid extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis has led to the isolation of 20 known isoflavonoids and coumarins, and glycycarpan (7), a new pterocarpan. The presence of two isoflavan-quinones, licoriquinone A (8) and licoriquinone B (9), in a fraction subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 is due to suspected metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of licoricidin (1) and licorisoflavan A (2). The major compounds in the extract, as well as 8, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of several major oral pathogens. Compounds 1 and 2 showed the most potent antibacterial activities, causing a marked growth inhibition of the cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus at 10 mug/mL and the periodontopathogenic species Porphyromonas gingivalis (at 5 mug/mL) and Prevotella intermedia (at 5 mug/mL for 1 and 2.5 mug/mL for 2). Only 1 moderately inhibited growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum at the highest concentration tested (10 mug/mL).
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum: an emerging gut pathogen?
AB  - The Gram-negative, non-sporulating, obligately anaerobic species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, is rapidly gaining notoriety as a pathogen with a surprising number of associated diseases. Recently, we have found that F. nucleatum is a more common resident of the GI tract than originally thought, and thus, through several studies, we have attempted to determine its gut-relevant potential for virulence. We have found that F. nucleatum possesses a number of pathogenic traits with relevance to gut diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, we have also documented strain-associated differences in virulence. An intriguing picture emerges that paints F. nucleatum as both conferring beneficial as well as detrimental effects on host cells; and we suggest that the ultimate effects of F. nucleatum infection in the gut are a consequence of the microbes with which this species aggregates.
TI  - Community-based interference against integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  - As part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. Unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Less emphasis has been given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. When co-cultivated in saliva medium, P. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. Furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. More interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent P. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. Our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum adhesin FadA binds vascular endothelial cadherin and alters endothelial integrity.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe, capable of systemic dissemination causing infections and abscesses, often in mixed-species, at different body sites. We have shown previously that F. nucleatum adheres to and invades host epithelial and endothelial cells via a novel FadA adhesin. In this study, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, a member of the cadherin family and a cell-cell junction molecule, was identified as the endothelial receptor for FadA, required for F. nucleatum binding to the cells. FadA colocalized with VE-cadherin on endothelial cells, causing relocation of VE-cadherin away from the cell-cell junctions. As a result, the endothelial permeability was increased, allowing the bacteria to cross the endothelium through loosened junctions. This crossing mechanism may explain why the organism is able to disseminate systemically to colonize in different body sites and even overcome the placental and blood-brain barriers. Co-incubation of F. nucleatum and Escherichia coli enhanced penetration of the endothelial cells by the latter in the transwell assays, suggesting F. nucleatum may serve as an 'enabler' for other microorganisms to spread systemically. This may explain why F. nucleatum is often found in mixed infections. This study reveals a possible novel dissemination mechanism utilized by pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of o-cymen-5-ol and zinc, alone & in combination in simple  solutions and toothpaste formulations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o-cymen-5-ol/zinc system. METHODS: o-Cymen-5-ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined against Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Candida albicans. Synergy was investigated by checkerboard MIC/MBC; inhibition of P. gingivalis protease activity and S. mutans glycolysis were investigated. Slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against S. mutans and E. coli. RESULTS: o-Cymen-5-ol MIC was between 1.7 mM to 3.4 mM; MBC was 3.4 mM to 6.7 mM. Zinc gluconate MIC was 2.8 mM to 11 mM; MBC was between 11 mM and >44 mM. The two agents in solution showed synergy (FICI</=0.50) against P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, with MIC of 0.42 mM/0.69 mM for o-cymen-5-ol/zinc gluconate, respectively. Zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o-cymen-5-ol; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive. o-Cymen-5-ol/zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo (120s log10 kill=7.35+/-0.40 and 4.02+/-0.40, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The zinc/o-cymen-5-ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease-related processes. Synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes. A system combining o-cymen-5-ol and zinc shows properties desirable for incorporation in toothpastes.
TI  - The comparative evaluation of xanthan gel with chlorhexidine (Chlosite) in smokers and non-smokers: A clinical and microbiological assessment.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prevention of the periodontal disease progression is the primary goal of periodontal therapy. When conventional therapy is found inadequate to attain periodontal health in chronic periodontitis, local antimicrobial agents have been used as an adjunct with scaling and root planning (SRP) which has reproduced encouraging results. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the new sustained released local drug Chlosite clinically and microbiologically in smokers and non-smokers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were grouped into experimental group A treated with SRP plus Chlosite (SRP + CHL), experimental group B treated with Chlosite alone (CHL), and control group C treated only with SRP alone. A total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) participated in this study. The clinical parameters, Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Bleeding index (BI), and Relative attachment level (RAL), were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were collected and subjected to microbiological analysis. RESULTS: On comparison of smokers and non-smokers, in SRP group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in BI and GI and smokers showed a higher reduction in PI. There was no significant gain in RAL of both smokers and non-smokers. In SRP + CHL group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to BI and GI and smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to PI. There was no significant gain in RAL of both smokers and non-smokers. In CHL group, both smokers and non-smokers showed a nonsignificant reduction in BI, GI, and RAL, but smokers showed a significant reduction in PI as compared with non-smokers. All the groups showed reduction in the microbial count of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia which were found to be statistically not significant when it was compared between non-smokers and smokers. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: In this study, all treatment groups were found to be efficacious in the treatment of periodontal disease as demonstrated by improvement in PI, GI, BI, and RAL. Combination of SRP and Chlosite resulted in added benefits compared with the two treatment groups.
TI  - Limited in-depth invasion of Fusobacterium nucleatum into in vitro reconstructed  human gingiva.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fusobacterium nucleatum is an opportunistic pathogen with a key role in subgingival plaque formation and it is found in increased numbers in periodontally affected sites. This study aimed to investigate the potential of F. nucleatum to penetrate and induce alterations in an in vitro reconstructed human gingival mucosa model. METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) organotypic models of human gingiva were engineered using primary gingival keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The reconstructed tissues were challenged with four different strains of fluorescently labelled F. nucleatum in suspension placed on top of epithelial layers. Confocal laser scanning was used to assess the presence of fusobacteria through the organotypic model. Apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and cell proliferation (Ki-67) were evaluated by the use of immunohistochemistry in 3D-tissue models. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to investigate the mRNA expression for MMP-13 and E-cadherin in both 3D-tissues and monolayers. RESULTS: F. nucleatum invaded the superficial epithelial layers of gingival 3D-tissue models. Challenged tissues showed accentuated shedding of superficial layers and increased number of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki-67 positive cells than controls, although not statistically significant. Levels of E-cadherin and MMP-13 mRNA were not significantly perturbed in multilayer culture. A variable and disproportionate response of MMP-13 mRNA level resulted in challenged primary keratinocytes in monolayers, compared to multilayer culture. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that F. nucleatum is able to invade superficially a differentiated, stratified gingival epithelium in vitro and triggers the efficient elimination of bacterial infection through epithelial shredding without causing a permanent damage of the tissue.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma.
AB  - An estimated 15% or more of the cancer burden worldwide is attributable to known  infectious agents. We screened colorectal carcinoma and matched normal tissue specimens using RNA-seq followed by host sequence subtraction and found marked over-representation of Fusobacterium nucleatum sequences in tumors relative to control specimens. F. nucleatum is an invasive anaerobe that has been linked previously to periodontitis and appendicitis, but not to cancer. Fusobacteria are rare constituents of the fecal microbiota, but have been cultured previously from biopsies of inflamed gut mucosa. We obtained a Fusobacterium isolate from a frozen tumor specimen; this showed highest sequence similarity to a known gut mucosa isolate and was confirmed to be invasive. We verified overabundance of Fusobacterium sequences in tumor versus matched normal control tissue by quantitative PCR analysis from a total of 99 subjects (p = 2.5 x 10(-6)), and we observed a positive association with lymph node metastasis.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum prosthetic hip infection in an adult with sickle cell-beta thalassemia.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus commensal to the human oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract which causes an array of human infection, yet it has never been associated with infection of prosthetic joints. We report the first case of prosthetic hip infection caused by F. nucleatum in a man with sickle cell-beta thalassemia.
TI  - The role of aggregation in Fusobacterium nucleatum- induced immune cell death.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fusobacterium nucleatum, an anaerobic oral bacterium, has been shown to be highly abundant in endodontic infections. Its role in these infections remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that F. nucleatum could aggregate immune cells. We have demonstrated that F. nucleatum can induce significant apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this in vitro study, we sought to determine what role this aggregation phenomenon has on the induction of apoptosis in PBMCs. METHODS: F. nucleatum bacteria were treated as follows: formaldehyde-fixed, heat-treated, or sonicated before co-culturing with PBMCs. Cell aggregation and apoptosis of the PBMCs were assessed under light microscopy and analyzed by flow cytometry, respectively. PBMCs were then immobilized with a Matrigel matrix before treatment with F. nucleatum. Aggregation and apoptosis were assessed as before. Surface staining of activation marker CD69 was assessed by flow cytometry. The apoptosis and CD69 data underwent one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Bonferroni test and chi(2) test, respectively, to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Viable and formaldehyde-treated but not sonicated or heat-treated F. nucleatum bacteria were able to cause severe aggregation and apoptosis of the immune cells. Disruption of F. nucleatum mediated aggregation by immobilization of the cells with a Matrigel matrix resulted in a significant diminution of cell death but not cell activation when assessed by using surface expression of CD69 early activation antigen. CONCLUSIONS: F. nucleatum's ability to induce cell death in immune cells appears to be mediated through the immune cells being aggregated, which might have important implications for its pathogenesis.
TI  - Participation of strictly anerobic bacteria in infections among hospitalized transplant patients in a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many strictly anerobic bacteria are a part of the human commensal microflora. Especially multitudinously they inhabit the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory, and genital tracts. Infections with these bacteria may occur after escape of the bacteria from their natural habitat. There are often mixed anerobic and aerobic infections. After rupture of the gastrointestinal tract or surgery, the organisms can cause significant pathology including abscesses and bacteremia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of gram-negative strictly anerobic bacteria isolated from different samples collected from patients on transplant wards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from patients with suspected infections. Underwent isolation and identification of microorganisms under anerobic conditions using standard laboratory methods. RESULTS: Gram-negative rods were observed in 46% of clinical samples, most frequently Bacteroides genus as well as Fusobacterium necrophorum/F.nucleatum and F.mortiferum (14%). Most species of the genus Bacteroides were accompanied by Escherichia coli, less frequently with other aerobic gram-negative rods or gram-positive cocci. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were frequently isolated in the samples. Because they are the part of the normal flora, this observation indicated the endogenous nature of infections resulting from bacterial translocation out of their natural habitat.
TI  - Isolation and molecular identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum from Nigerian patients with oro-facial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum is one of the most common anaerobic bacteria  present in the oral cavity and is often isolated from infections involving other body sites. OBJECTIVE: To characterise F. nucleatum strains from patients attending a teaching hospital in Nigeria in order to provide information on the methods for accurate identification of anaerobes in clinical specimen. METHODS: Fusobacterium nucleatum specie from 50 patients presenting with oro-facial infections were studied by culture on Fusobacterium selective agar and fastidious anaerobe agar. The isolates were characterised based on colonial morphology, microscopy, lipase production, susceptibility to kanamycin and colistin and resistance to vancomycin. Biochemical tests were performed using a commercial test kit. The identity of the isolates was confirmed based on molecular characterization performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Forty-eight (96%) F. nucleatum isolates were obtained from the 50 patients by culture and all the isolates were identified by colonial appearance and microscopy based on their unique spindle shape with tapered ends. Only 26 (54.2%) of the 48 isolates were identified by commercial API 20A test kit while PCR confirmed the identity of all the isolates. CONCLUSION: Anaerobes are involved in human infections and their study is quite cumbersome due to tedious nature and high cost of the techniques involved. Cultural method is reliable in the isolation and identification of F. nucleatum species. PCR is a rapid and simple method that can complement the phenotypic identification of anaerobes and would assist in their full identification.
TI  - Effect of a self-etching adhesive containing an antibacterial monomer on clinical periodontal parameters and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of a self-etching adhesive system containing an antibacterial monomer on periodontal health and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients and to compare it with a conventional adhesive system. METHODS: A split-mouth design was chosen, and 15 patients were included in the study. Brackets in contralateral quadrants were bonded with either a conventional adhesive system (control) or a self-etching adhesive system that contained an antibacterial monomer. Clinical periodontal parameters including plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and bleeding on probing were determined. Subgingival plaque samples were collected before bracket placement (T0) and at the 6-month follow-up (T1). The real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine the subgingival counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Campylobacter rectus. For clinical periodontal parameters, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and, for bacterial counts, Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons at the P <0.05 level. RESULTS: Clinical periodontal parameters were not changed, and they were not different between the groups from T0 to T1. T forsythensis and F nucleatum increased during the treatment period in both groups (P <0.05). The majority of the bacteria were T nucleatum at T0 and T1 in both groups. Changes in bacterial load from T0 to T1 were not different between groups except for T forsythensis and F nucleatum (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an antibacterial monomer did not have an additional positive effect on clinical periodontal parameters. When used in bonding orthodontic brackets, the antibacterial monomer failed to reduce periodontopathogenic bacteria when compared with the conventional adhesive system during a 6-month treatment period.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of povidone-iodine against an artificial biofilm of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) on an artificial dual species biofilm of periodontal pathogens. DESIGN: Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum grown in broth culture was inoculated on polycarbonate membrane (PCM) tissue culture inserts. After incubation for 72 h, PVP-I solutions were applied to the biofilm for the time period ranging from 0.5 to 5 min. After addition of a deactivator, each PCM was removed and the biofilm on the PCM was serially diluted and plated on blood agar plates and cultured anaerobically for 7 days. Then viable bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: In the dual species biofilm model, F. nucleatum showed an approximately 200-fold increase in viable counts when compared with mono-microbial biofilm. In dual species biofilm, PVP-I with concentration equal to or greater than 2% was required to significantly reduce P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. When the contact time of PVP-I was increased to 1 min or greater, no difference in antibacterial activity of PVP-I was observed in any concentration. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 30s application of 2% PVP-I would be effective in suppressing both P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum in dual-species biofilm, and this provides clinical implication for the control of subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Synergy in biofilm formation between Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella species.
AB  - The formation of biofilm by anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria in the subgingival  crevice plays an important role in the development of chronic periodontitis. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of coaggregation between Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella species in biofilm formation. Coaggregation between F. nucleatum and Prevotella species was determined by visual assay. Effect of co-culture of the species on biofilm formation was assessed by crystal violet staining. Effect of soluble factor on biofilm formation was also examined using culture supernatant and two-compartment co-culture separated by a porous membrane. Production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) by the organisms was evaluated using Vibrio harveyi BB170. Cells of all F. nucleatum strains coaggregated with Prevotella intermedia or Prevotella nigrescens with a score of 1-4. Addition of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid or l-lysine inhibited coaggregation. Coaggregation disappeared after heating of P. intermedia or P. nigrescens cells, or Proteinase K treatment of P. nigrescens cells. Co-culture of F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 with P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains increased biofilm formation compared with single culture (p < 0.01); co-culture with culture supernatant of these strains, however, did not enhance biofilm formation by F. nucleatum. Production of AI-2 in Prevotella species was not related to enhancement of biofilm formation by F. nucleatum. These findings indicate that physical contact by coaggregation of F. nucleatum strains with P. intermedia or P. nigrescens plays a key role in the formation of biofilm by these strains.
TI  - Colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. We also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. Samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by PCR Invader technology. Detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by PCR. Fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. Cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. RESULTS: Detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum (p < 0.01). Detection rate of F. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. A positive correlation was observed between DNA quantification of P. gingivalis and number of Candida species in saliva. Cluster analysis of the test species identified two clusters. Tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque status was associated with the detection rate of T. denticola and F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: Results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by T. denticola and F. nucleatum.
TI  - A role of oral bacteria in bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw.
AB  - No consensus has yet been reached to associate oral bacteria conclusively with the etio-pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw (BONJ). Therefore, the present study examined the effects of oral bacteria on the development of BONJ-like lesions in a mouse model. In the pamidronate (Pam)-treated mice, but not control non-drug-treated mice, tooth extraction followed by oral infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum caused BONJ-like lesions and delayed epithelial healing, both of which were completely suppressed by a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail. Furthermore, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, the combination of Pam and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused the death of gingival fibroblasts (GFs) and down-regulated their production of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), which induces epithelial cell growth and migration. Therefore, in periodontal tissues pre-exposed to bisphosphonate, bacterial infection at tooth extraction sites caused diminished KGF expression in GFs, leading to a delay in the epithelial wound-healing process that was mitigated by antibiotics.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and human beta-defensins modulate the release of antimicrobial chemokine CCL20/macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha.
AB  - Cells of the innate immune system regulate immune responses through the production of antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, and cytokines, including human beta-defensins (hBDs) and CCL20. In this study, we examined the kinetics of primary human oral epithelial cell (HOEC) production of CCL20 and hBDs in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum, a commensal bacterium of the oral cavity, which we previously showed promotes HOEC induction of hBDs. HOECs secrete maximal levels of CCL20 at 6 h, following stimulation by F. nucleatum cell wall (FnCW). The kinetics of CCL20 release is distinct from that of hBD-2 and -3, which peaks after 24 h and 48 h of FnCW stimulation, respectively. FnCW-induced release of CCL20 by HOECs requires both transcriptional and translational activation. Release of CCL20 by HOECs is inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting that it is secreted through a vesicle transport pathway. Other epithelium-derived agents that FnCW induces, such as hBD-2, hBD-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), are also able to release CCL20. By focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinases, we show that both extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38, but not JNK, are required for hBD-, TNF-alpha-, and IL-1beta-induced secretion of CCL20 by HOECs. The ability of FnCW and its induced hBDs to produce proinflammatory cytokines and CCL20 suggests the broad role of F. nucleatum and human antimicrobial peptides in primary immune responses elicited by oral epithelium.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of chemomechanical instrumentation and calcium hydroxide in primary teeth with pulp necrosis.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study's purposes were to: evaluate the antibacterial effect of chemomechanical instrumentation and a calcium hydroxide-based dressing in primary teeth with pulp necrosis secondary to trauma; and detect the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and black-pigmented rods in the canals of these teeth. METHODS: Microbiological sample collections (MSCs) were obtained: after coronal access to the canals of primary incisors (in 18 teeth; MSC 1); after chemomechanical instrumentation (in 10 teeth; MSC 2); and 72 hours after removal of intracanal medication (in 18 teeth; MSC 3). These samples were sent for microbiological processing. The results were analyzed statistically via chi-square, analysis of variance, and Games-Howell tests (P<.05). RESULTS: Micro-organisms were isolated in approximately 94%, 10%, and 83% of canals, respectively, in MSCs 1, 2, and 3. There was a statistically significant difference only between MSCs 1 and 2 (P<.03). F nucleatum and black-pigmented rods were detected in approximately 56% and 11% of canals in MSC 1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chemomechanical instrumentation and calcium hydroxide-based dressing have an anti-bacterial effect by significantly reducing the number of micro-organisms in the main root canal. They showed a limited efficacy, however, and did not prevent bacterial regrowth after endodontic therapy in primary teeth with pulp necrosis secondary to trauma.
TI  - Levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  - Maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. It is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. This study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia were not observed in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. Interestingly, Porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98E+02 and 1.75E+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with Fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32E+03 cells ml(-1). Although F. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.
TI  - Detection of odoriferous subgingival and tongue microbiota in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with oral malodor using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Halitosis has been correlated with the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced in the oral cavity by metabolic activity of bacteria colonizing the periodontal pockets and the dorsum of the tongue. It has been assumed that there is a relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the malodor using the organoleptic method and tanita device; to quantify odoriferous microorganisms of subgingival plaque and tongue coating, such as P. gingivalis (Pg), T. forsythia (Tf), and F. nucleatum (Fn) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nondiabetic and diabetic chronic periodontitis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty chronic periodontitis patients (with and without diabetes) with 5-7 mm pocket depth, radiographic evidence of bone loss, and presence of oral malodor participated in this study. Subjective assessment of mouth air was done organoleptically and by using a portable sulfide monitor. Tongue coating was also assessed. RESULTS: The scores of plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding index, VSC levels, and tongue coating between the nondiabetic and diabetic patients were not significant (P>0.5). In nondiabetic patients, Fn was found to be significantly (P<0.5) more in tongue samples, whereas Pg and Tf have not shown significant values (P>0.5). In diabetic patients, Fn and Tf have shown significant (P<0.5) an increase in subgingival and tongue samples, respectively, whereas Pg has not shown significant difference between subgingival and tongue samples. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: The results confirm that there is no difference in clinical parameters between nondiabetic and diabetic periodontitis patients, but the odoriferous microbial profiles in tongue samples of diabetic patients were found to be high. However, there is a weak positive correlation between VSC levels, clinical parameters, and odoriferous microbial profiles.
TI  - Salivary beta-galactosidase activity affects physiological oral malodour.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have associated salivary beta-galactosidase activity with non-periodontopathic oral malodour. In this study, we investigated the localization of beta-galactosidase and elucidated the relationship between its enzymatic activity and physiological oral malodour. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-six patients complaining of halitosis were separated into two groups: periodontally healthy and periodontitis. Saliva samples from the subjects were separated by centrifugation, and the level of beta-galactosidase activity was measured in the supernatant, pellet lysate, and whole saliva using the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside. The correlation of salivary beta-galactosidase activity with breath odour and associated parameters was examined. RESULTS: Similar levels of beta-galactosidase activity were detected in the pellet lysate and whole saliva, but not in the saliva supernatant. Positive correlations were observed between the beta-galactosidase activity in whole saliva and oral malodour levels in the periodontally healthy group, but not in the periodontitis group. In addition, the plaque index and tongue coating score were positively correlated with beta-galactosidase activity in the periodontally healthy group. Overall, stimulated salivary flow and salivary pH were negatively correlated with enzyme activity. The amounts of total bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus salivarius were positively associated with beta-galactosidase activity in the periodontally healthy group. Furthermore, the amounts of total bacteria and S. salivarius were positively associated with the amount of volatile sulphur compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that beta-galactosidase is located on the cell surface of oral bacteria derived from dental plaque and tongue coating, and it plays an important role in producing the malodour underlying physiological oral malodour.
TI  - Short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. Plaque index (PI) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. In addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP) and width of keratinized gingiva (WKG) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). For statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. RESULTS: A significant increase of PI (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). Apart from Eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. PPD significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and GR especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). In the incision area the development of GR was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). Both gingival biotypes were affected by GR. CONCLUSIONS: Orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  - Isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. Compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. In contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. Neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus). Furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward P. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. Finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was much higher when compared to 2. The activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 and activator protein-1 (AP-1) associated with the LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.
TI  - Evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. METHODS: The study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the Philippe Pinel Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the CAGE (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (WHO). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (PD) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with PD < 4 mm. The presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed using the checkerboard technique. RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. However, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). Moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, F. nuc. nucleatum, Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, P. gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Tannerella forsythia at sites with PD < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). Of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented significantly higher mean levels of F. nuc. vincentii, F. nuc nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia than sites with PD >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.
TI  - Nonvolatile S-alk(en)ylthio-L-cysteine derivatives in fresh onion (Allium cepa L. cultivar).
AB  - The L-cysteine derivatives (R)-2-amino-3-(methyldisulfanyl)propanoic acid (S-methylthio-L-cysteine), (R)-2-amino-3-(propyldisulfanyl)propanoic acid (S-propylthio-L-cysteine), (R)-2-amino-3-(1-propenyldisulfanyl)propanoic acid (S-(1-propenylthio)-L-cysteine), and (R)-2-amino-3-(2-propenyldisulfanyl)propanoic acid (S-allylthio-L-cysteine) were prepared from 3-[(methoxycarbonyl)dithio]-L-alanine, obtained from the reaction of L-cysteine with methoxycarbonylsulfenyl chloride. The occurrence of these S-(+)-alk(en)ylthio-L-cysteine derivatives in onion (Allium cepa L.) was proven by using UPLC-MS-ESI(+) in SRM mode. Their concentrations in fresh onion were estimated to be 0.19 mg/kg S-methylthio-L-cysteine, 0.01 mg/kg S-propylthio-L-cysteine, and 0.56 mg/kg (S-(1-propenyllthio)-L-cysteine, concentrations that are about 3000 times lower than that of isoalliin (S-(1-propenyl-S-oxo-L-cysteine). These compounds were treated with Fusobacterium nucleatum, a microorganism responsible for the formation of mouth malodor. These L-cysteine disulfides were demonstrated to predominantly produce tri- and tetrasulfides. Isoalliin is almost entirely consumed by the plant enzyme alliin lyase (EC 4.4.1.4 S-alk(en)yl-S-oxo-L-cysteine lyase) in a few seconds, but it is not transformed by F. nucleatum. This example of flavor modulation shows that the plant produces different precursors, leading to the formation of the same types of volatile sulfur compounds. Whereas the plant enzyme efficiently transforms S-alk(en)yl-S-oxo-L-cysteine, mouth bacteria are responsible for the transformation of S-alk(en)ylthio-L-cysteine.
TI  - Analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult Norwegian patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult Norwegian patients. METHODS: Samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21) apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). DNA was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all cases. In teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were Dialister invisus (71%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). In chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were P. endodontalis (100%), D. invisus (89%), Parvimonas micra (78%), and Solobacterium moorei (78%). In teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were D. invisus, P. endodontalis, S. moorei, Propionibacterium acnes, and Streptococcus species (all in 69%). None of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (P > .05), except for Selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (P = .04). No taxa were found in significantly higher levels in any conditions (P > .05). Cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. Therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.
TI  - Efficacy of chlorhexidine digluconate-containing formulations and other mouthrinses against periodontopathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine in vitro the action of chlorhexidine digluconate and different commercially available mouthrinses on oral microorganisms. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations and possible induction of resistance by chlorhexidine digluconate, an essential oil-containing mouthwash and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride solution, were determined against microorganisms normally found in the oral cavity (10 streptococci, 2 enterobacteria, 1 Candida albicans, 8 Porphyromonas gingivalis, 6 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 1 Fusobacterium nucleatum). Further, the effect of a 1-minute exposure on cell and bacterial viability was studied. RESULTS: The susceptibility of the oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine digluconate ranged from 0.01% to 0.50%. Passages on agar plates containing subinhibitory concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate resulted in a transitory moderate increase in the tolerance to chlorhexidine digluconate in five of the 24 isolates. After 1 minute of exposure, chlorhexidine digluconate solutions as well as the essential oil and the amine/stannous fluoride-containing solutions showed a high activity against the tested microorganisms. Commercially available chlorhexidine digluconate formulations (ie, those with antidiscoloration systems) were partly less efficient than the corresponding manually prepared chlorhexidine digluconate preparation. The determination of MTT resulted in a strong cytotoxicity of all tested preparations to gingival fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that most of the chlorhexidine digluconate formulations as well as essential oil and the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride solutions are active against oral microbes. Long-term use of these agents would not result in emergent antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Invasive potential of gut mucosa-derived Fusobacterium nucleatum positively correlates with IBD status of the host.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a heterogeneous oral pathogen that is also a common resident of the human gut mucosa. Given that some strains of F. nucleatum are known to be invasive and proinflammatory in the oral mucosa, we compared strains isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with strains isolated from healthy controls to determine 1) whether this species was more commonly associated with IBD patients; and 2) whether gut-derived F. nucleatum strains from IBD patients showed an increased capacity for invasion. METHODS: Biopsy material was obtained from 56 adult patients undergoing colonoscopy for colon cancer screening purposes or assessment of irritable bowel syndrome status (34 patients), or to assess for presence of gastrointestinal disease (i.e., IBD or indeterminate colitis, 22 patients). We enumerated Fusobacterium spp. strains isolated from human gut biopsy material in a blinded fashion, and then compared the virulence potential of a subset of F. nucleatum strains using an invasion assay in a Caco-2 model system. RESULTS: Fusobacterium spp. were isolated from 63.6% of patients with gastrointestinal disease compared to 26.5% of healthy controls (P = 0.01). In total, 69% of all Fusobacterium spp. recovered from patients were identified as F. nucleatum. F. nucleatum strains originating from inflamed biopsy tissue from IBD patients were significantly more invasive in a Caco-2 cell invasion assay than strains that were isolated from healthy tissue from either IBD patients or control patients (P < 0.05 to 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that colonization of the intestinal mucosa by highly invasive strains of F. nucleatum may be a useful biomarker for gastrointestinal disease.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque and placenta of women with hypertension in pregnancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are many studies documenting increased prevalence of periodontal infection in women with preeclampsia. But, very few studies have attempted to establish causal relationship between the two. OBJECTIVE: To find out causal circumstantial evidence by isolating specific periodontal pathogens in oral and placental samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antenatal periodontal screening and subgingival plaque collection was carried out in ten women with hypertension in pregnancy and ten normotensive controls on their hospital admission at term for cesarean delivery. Placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of elective cesarean delivery. Subgingival plaque and placental biopsy were studied for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique. Periodontist and laboratory personnel were unaware of case or control status. Periodontal status was not informed to the obstetrician recruiting the cases and laboratory. Microbiology report was not revealed till end of the study. RESULTS: Periodontal pathogens were found to be high in the group with hypertension than the controls. P gingivalis was found in all the samples from subgingival plaque and placenta, irrespective of the periodontal disease status. CONCLUSION: In cases with hypertension, periodontal pathogens are present in higher proportion in subgingival plaque and placenta.
TI  - Identification of an L-methionine gamma-lyase involved in the production of hydrogen sulfide from L-cysteine in Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum produces an abundance of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in the  oral cavity that is mediated by several enzymes. The identification and characterization of three distinct enzymes (Fn0625, Fn1055 and Fn1220) in F. nucleatum that catalyse the production of H(2)S from l-cysteine have been reported. In the current study, a novel enzyme involved in the production of H(2)S in F. nucleatum ATCC 25586, whose molecular mass had been estimated to be approximately 130 kDa, was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF MS. The enzyme, Fn1419, has previously been characterized as an l-methionine gamma-lyase. SDS-PAGE and gel-filtration chromatography indicated that Fn1419 has a molecular mass of 43 kDa and forms tetramers in solution. Unlike other enzymes associated with H(2)S production in F. nucleatum, the quaternary structure of Fn1419 was not completely disrupted by exposure to SDS. The purified recombinant enzyme exhibited a K(m) of 0.32+/-0.02 mM and a k(cat) of 0.69+/-0.01 s(-1). Based on current and published data, the enzymic activity for H(2)S production from l-cysteine in F. nucleatum is ranked as follows: Fn1220>Fn1055>Fn1419>Fn0625. Based on kinetic values and relative mRNA levels of the respective genes, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR, the amount of H(2)S produced by Fn1419 was estimated to be 1.9 % of the total H(2)S produced from l-cysteine in F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. In comparison, Fn1220 appeared to contribute significantly to H(2)S production (87.6 %).
TI  - Microbiological aspects of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological, and biochemical features of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants exhibiting peri-implantitis were compared with those experiencing long-term peri-implant health. After evaluation of clinical parameters, submucosal plaque samples were obtained from permucosal implant abutment posts exhibiting probing depths >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing in subjects with peri-implantitis (n = 3) and from posts with peri-implant health in subjects with long-term subperiosteal implant health (n = 8). The microbial specimens were transported in VMGA III and plated onto enriched Brucella blood agar and Hammond's selective medium with anaerobic incubation, and onto selective TSBV with 5% CO2 incubation. Total anaerobic viable counts and selected bacterial species were identified using established phenotypic methods and criteria. In vitro resistance to doxycycline (2 mug/mL), amoxicillin (2 mug/mL), or metronidazole (4 mug/mL) was recorded per subject when bacterial pathogen growth was noted on antibiotic-supplemented isolation plates. Interleukin (IL)-1beta levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peri-implant crevicular fluid samples from 5 study subjects. Significantly higher Plaque Index scores, higher total anaerobic viable counts, more red complex species, and lower proportions of gram-positive facultative viridans streptococci and Actinomyces species were detected on peri-implantitis-affected subperiosteal implants as compared with subperiosteal implants with long-term peri-implant health. No in vitro resistance to the 3 test antibiotic breakpoint concentrations studied was found, except a Fusobacterium nucleatum strain resistant to doxycycline at 2 mug/mL from 1 peri-implantitis subject. Subperiosteal implants with peri-implantitis tended to yield higher peri-implant crevicular fluid IL-1beta levels. The level of peri-implant supramucosal plaque control and the composition of the peri-implant submucosal microbiome may be important determinants of the long-term clinical status of mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.
TI  - Analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria isolated from  endodontic infections in Brazil during a period of nine years.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to analyze the susceptibility of some anaerobic species isolated from a Brazilian population at different periods of time by determining a pattern of development of resistance to frequently prescribed antibiotics in endodontics. METHODS: Root canal samples were collected from infected teeth at different periods of time (2000-2002, 2003-2005, and 2007-2008) and microbiologically identified with conventional culture techniques. The susceptibility of Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, P. oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and P. micra isolated strains was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanate, benzylpenicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole by using the E-test method. RESULTS: Amoxicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate were effective against the majority of species at the different periods of study. Overall, there were low statistical differences regarding the microbial susceptibility between the experimental periods. However, an increase in the anaerobic resistance to penicillin G and clindamycin was observed. Resistance to erythromycin was observed in all species, and there were statistically significant differences between 2000-2002 and 2003-2005 periods for F. nucleatum (P < .05) and between 2003-2005 and 2007-2008 periods for P. intermedia/nigrescens and P. oralis (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance of anaerobes isolated from primary endodontic infections showed an increase throughout a period of time regarding a specific Brazilian population.
TI  - Molecular sensing by the aptamer domain of the FMN riboswitch: a general model for ligand binding by conformational selection.
AB  - Understanding the nature of the free state of riboswitch aptamers is important for illuminating common themes in gene regulation by riboswitches. Prior evidence indicated the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding riboswitch aptamer adopted a 'bound-like' structure in absence of FMN, suggesting only local conformational changes upon ligand binding. In the scope of pinpointing the general nature of such changes at the nucleotide level, we performed SHAPE mapping experiments using the aptamer domain of two phylogenetic variants, both in absence and in presence of FMN. We also solved the crystal structures of one of these domains both free (3.3 A resolution) and bound to FMN (2.95 A resolution). Our comparative study reveals that structural rearrangements occurring upon binding are restricted to a few of the joining regions that form the binding pocket in both RNAs. This type of binding event with minimal structural perturbations is reminiscent of binding events by conformational selection encountered in other riboswitches and various RNAs.

TI  - Spontaneously draining acute otitis media in children: an observational study of  clinical findings, microbiology and clinical course.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the outcome of acute otitis media (AOM) with otorrhoea in children managed initially without antibiotics, in relation to bacterial and clinical findings, and to identify those who may benefit from antibiotics. METHODS: Otherwise healthy, not otitis prone children aged 2-16 y, presenting with AOM with spontaneous otorrhoea, were recruited from primary care and followed at selected ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinics. Specimens for bacterial investigations were obtained; symptoms were registered on a daily basis. The main outcomes measured were the frequency of children treated with antibiotics due to persisting AOM within 9 days in relation to clinical and bacteriological findings, and new AOM within 3 months. RESULTS: Twelve of 71 children who completed the trial received antibiotics during the first 9 days due to lack of improvement. One received antibiotics after 16 days due to relapsing AOM and 6 received antibiotics after 30 days due to new AOM. At 2-4 days following inclusion, over 70% of children showed normalized eardrum status and markedly reduced secretion. Alloiococcus otitidis was found in 23 samples, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in 5. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Fusobacterium necrophorum were not detected. Antibiotics were prescribed more extensively to children with a pulsating eardrum and abundant purulent secretion. All children with S. pyogenes received antibiotics, whereas children with only A. otitidis did not. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that antibiotics are indicated in AOM with otorrhoea and the presence of abundant purulent secretion, a pulsating eardrum, or the presence of S. pyogenes. The presence of only A. otitidis was not associated with a more prolonged course or the need for antibiotics.

TI  - [Expression of tumor necrosis factor in placenta tissue of pregnant rats with chronic peridontitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of tumor necrosis factor in placenta of pregnant rats with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty Wistar female rats were randomly divided into two groups, control (n = 8) and experimental group (n = 12). The periodontitis model was established in the experimental group. The females and males in the two groups got together four weeks later. Nineteen days after pregnancy all rats were executed and placenta collected. The delivery time and neonatal birth weight were recorded and the pathological changes of periodontal tissue observed. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression was examined in placenta by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: The animal model of chronic periodontitis was successfully established. Experimental group delivered 30 offspring and the control group 56 offspring. The average number of pups born alive per litter in experimental group (4.1 +/- 2.2) was significantly lower than that in control group (9.2 +/- 2.2), P < 0.05. The birth weight of pups in experimental group [(5.01 +/- 0.43) g] was significantly lower than that in the control group [(5.79 +/- 0.53) g], P < 0.05. The relative quantitative expression of TNF was (1.807 +/- 0.265) in experimental group the and (1.003 +/- 0.021) in the control group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periodontitis may be related to preterm low birth weight.
TI  - Synergistic growth effect among bacteria recovered from root canal infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the ecological relationships between bacterial species that colonize infected root canals. Root canal bacteria recovered from one patient with pulp canal necrosis were evaluated in vitro for synergistic and antagonistic activities determined by mono and co-culture growth kinetics and the production of bacteriocin-like substances using the double layer diffusion method. Peptostreptococcus prevotii triggered a significant increase of Fusobacterium nucleatum growth, while the former bacteria did not affect the growth of P. prevotii. The bacterial species did not produce antagonism activity against itself or against any of the other two species. Despite many studies have demonstrated the capability of root canal microorganisms to produce antagonistic substances, these in vitro experimental tests show the synergistic effect of P. prevotii on the growth of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Tongue piercing: the effect of material on microbiological findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: Biofilms on oral piercings may serve as a bacterial reservoir and lead to systemic bacteremia or local transmission of pathogenic microbiota. The use of piercing materials which are less susceptible to biofilm accumulation could contribute to prevention of problems. The present study investigated whether there are microbiological differences in bacterial samples collected from tongue piercings made of different materials. METHODS: A total of 85 subjects with tongue piercings participated in this study. After a baseline dental examination, sterile piercings of four different materials were randomly allocated to the study subjects. After 2 weeks, microbiologic samples were collected and processed by checkerboard deoxyribonucleic acid- deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization methods. RESULTS: About 28.8% of subjects reported 61 lingual recessions (1.91 +/- .96 mm), whereas 5% reported tooth chipping on one tooth each. With the exception of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Y4), Fusobacterium nucleatum species, and Parvimonas micra, bacteria associated with periodontitis were not commonly found in the samples from studs or piercing channels. Of the 80 bacterial species, 67 were found at significantly higher levels (p < .001) in samples from stainless steel than from polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene piercings. CONCLUSION: The low bacterial counts from piercing channels suggest that having a tongue pierced would not contribute to an increased risk for oral infection. The present study demonstrated that studs made of steel might promote the development of a biofilm, whereas those made of polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene may be rather inert to bacterial colonization. The finding of Staphylococci on steel and titanium studs may suggest an elevated risk for complication if the piercing channel is infected.
TI  - A novel organotypic dento-epithelial culture model: effect of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm on B-defensin-2, -3, and LL-37 expression.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present study, the expression and localization of three epithelial peptides (human beta-defensin [hBD]-2 and -3, and cathelicidin [LL-37]) are studied in an organotypic dento-epithelial (OD-E) model exposed to Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) biofilm. METHODS: Biofilm of Fn ATCC 25586 or AHN 9508 were produced by culturing each strain on semipermeable membranes. The OD-E model was constructed by seeding keratinocytes on fibroblast-containing collagen gels and by placing dentin pieces on the top. A 3-day-old biofilm was placed on the top of the OD-E and the coculture was incubated for 5 hours or 24 hours. Production of epithelial antimicrobial peptides was determined immunohistochemically. RESULTS: After 5 hours of incubation, the biofilm of each Fn strain stimulated expression of hBD-2 and -3. hBD-2 was localized on superficial layers and hBD-3 on basal cell layers of the epithelium and dento-epithelial junctions, whereas LL-37 was only weakly expressed. After 24 hours, hBD-2 expression was extended toward basal cell layers of the epithelium. In contrast, hBD-3 expression extended toward superficial layers of the epithelium. In the case of Fn AHN 9508 biofilm, LL-37 was localized in the cell layers of the dento-epithelial junction. CONCLUSION: In our OD-E model, epithelial antimicrobial peptide responses to Fn biofilms have distinct regulation and localization characteristics, resembling those known to occur in the gingival epithelium in vivo.
TI  - [Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori detected by real-time PCR in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. The  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of H. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at H. pylori. METHODOLOGY: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. The DNA was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of H. pylori by real-time PCR (LightCycler) using 16S rRNA#120 primers which targeted the 16S rRNA gene. DNA from H. pylori DSM 4867 was used as a positive control. Seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for H. pylori. RESULTS: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of H. pylori. All the positives sites were also positives to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to Porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to Treponema denticola, 25% to Prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. F. nucleatum and E. corrodens could coaggregate with H. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.
TI  - Experimental alveolitis in rats: microbiological, acute phase response and histometric characterization of delayed alveolar healing.
AB  - The pathogenesis of alveolitis is not well known and therefore experimental situations that mimic some features of this disease should be developed. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the evolution of the experimentally induced infection in rat sockets is characterized, which leads to clinical signs of suppurative alveolitis with remarkable wound healing disturbs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-infected (Group I) and experimentally infected sockets in Rattus novergicus (Group II) were histometrically evaluated regarding the kinetics of alveolar healing. In addition, the characterization of the present bacteria in inoculation material and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were performed. The detected species were Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus anginosus, Treponema socranskii and Streptococcus sanguis. RESULTS: All experimentally infected rats developed suppurative alveolitis, showing higher levels of CRP in comparison to those non-infected ones. Furthermore, infected rats presented a significant delayed wound healing as measured by the histometric analysis (higher persistent polymorphonuclear infiltrate and lower density of newly formed bone). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that rat sockets with experimentally induced infection produced higher levels of serum CRP, showing the potential of disseminated infection and a disturb in the alveolar repair process in an interesting experimental model for alveolitis studies.
TI  - Efficacy of taurolidine against periodontopathic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of taurolidine was tested against periodontopathic species in comparison to chlorhexidine digluconate in the presence or absence of serum. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), microbiocidal concentrations (MBC), as well as killing were determined against 32 different microbial strains including 3 Porphyromonas gingivalis, 3 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 15 potentially superinfecting species with and without 25% v/v human serum. The MIC(50) of taurolidine against the tested microbial strains was 0.025% and the MIC(90) 0.05%. The respective values for the MBCs were 0.05% and 0.1%. Addition of 25% serum (heat-inactivated) did not change the MIC and MBC values of taurolidine. In contrast, MICs and MBCs of chlorhexidine (CHX) increased by two steps after addition of serum. Taurolidine killed microorganisms in a concentration and time-dependent manner, the killing rate of 1.6% taurolidine was 99.08% +/- 2.27% in mean after 2 h. Again, killing activity of taurolidine was not affected if serum was added, whereas addition of inactivated serum clearly reduced the killing rate of all selected bacterial strains by CHX. Therefore, taurolidine possesses antimicrobial properties which are not reduced in the presence of serum as a main component in gingival crevicular fluid and wound fluid. Taurolidine may have potential as an antimicrobial agent in non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  - Characteristics and outcomes of Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteremia--a 6-year experience at a tertiary care hospital in northern Taiwan.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteremia is critical and not well defined. To identify  the clinical characteristics and outcomes, we conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized patients from January 2004 to December 2009 at a tertiary center in northern Taiwan. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 58.1 years, and the mean Pitt bacteremia score was 4.7. Males predominated (59.6%), and the overall 30-day mortality rate was up to 47.4%. Malignancy was the major comorbidity (26/57, 45.6%), especially oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal cancers (19/26, 73.1%). Pneumonia (17/57, 29.8%) was the most common presentation with high rates of respiratory failure (15/17, 88.2%) and mortality (11/17, 64.7%), followed by intra-abdominal infections (7/57, 12.3%). In multivariate analysis, higher Pitt bacteremia score, nosocomial infection, anemia, and intensive care unit stay were the independent factors for 30-day mortality. Nosocomial F. nucleatum bacteremia was a significant mortality predictor independent to other parameters of disease severities.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of adjunctive use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse in untreated gingivitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (CHX) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in patients with untreated gingivitis. Fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to CHX or placebo groups. CHX group rinsed with 0.2% CHX, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. Subgingival plaque samples were collected and plaque index (PI), papilla bleeding index (PBI), calculus index, and probing pocket depth (PPD) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. The amounts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria were detected by quantitative real-time PCR method. In the CHX group the total bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p > 0.05). CHX mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.
TI  - Oxidative stress response in the opportunistic oral pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The anaerobic, Gram-negative bacillus Fusobacterium nucleatum plays a vital role  in oral biofilm formation and the development of periodontal disease. The organism plays a central bridging role between early and late colonizers within dental plaque and plays a protective role against reactive oxygen species. Using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry approach, we have annotated 78 proteins within the proteome of F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and identified those proteins whose apparent intracellular concentrations change in response to either O(2)- or H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. Three major protein systems were altered in response to oxidative stress: (i) proteins of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase/thioredoxin reductase system were increased in intracellular concentration; (ii) glycolytic enzymes were modified by oxidation (i.e. D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose 6-phosphate aldolase) or increased in intracellular concentration, with an accompanying decrease in ATP production; and (iii) the intracellular concentrations of molecular chaperone proteins and related proteins (i.e. ClpB, DnaK, HtpG, and HrcA) were increased.
TI  - Garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  - Garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. Allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. This study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. Allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. The broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/mL or higher. Planktonic growth of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/mL. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/mL). Gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate N(alpha)-benzoyl-L-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of P. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. A gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/mL), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. Live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to S. mutans grown in mature biofilms. However, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. In conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial compounds from Siraitia grosvenorii leaves.
AB  - Luo Han Guo (LHG) fruits (Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle) have been used as traditional medicine in China for centuries to treat sore throats and coughs. However, LHG leaves are seldom used and minimal scientific information is available on them. In our recent study on the leaves of S. grosvenorii, the bioactive compounds beta-amyrin (2), aloe emodin (5), aloe-emodin acetate (6), 5alpha,8alpha-epidioxy-24(R)-methylcholesta-6,22-dien-3beta-ol (7) and p-hydroxyl benzyl acid (8), accompanied by n-hexadecaoic acid (1), 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (3), beta-sitosterol (4) and daucosterol (9) were first obtained. Their structures have been identified on the basis of spectroscopic studies. The activities of these compounds were evaluated in vitro against the growth of oral bacterial species Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and the yeast Candida albicans, and their minimum inhibition concentrations were determined. Furthermore, the activity against S. mutans is likely to be due to the inhibition of glucosyltransferase. The experimental data provide important information on bioactive phytochemicals in the leaf of S. grosvenorii, which shows that the leaf can be a new resource as an antibacterial agent.
TI  - Interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  - Primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. Multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. Multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum or Streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. Porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas S. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. None of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. P. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. However, A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-8 secretion; and F. nucleatum stimulated production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and S. gordonii, but not P. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. The results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. In addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - The interaction between Lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. This study examined the effects of L. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms. Human-derived L. reuteri strains (KCTC 3594 and KCTC 3678) and rat-derived L. reuteri KCTC 3679 were used. All strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of S. mutans biofilms. These antibacterial activities of L. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. Reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by L. reuteri KCTC 3594. In addition, L. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. Overall, these results suggest that L. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum infection of colonic cells stimulates MUC2 mucin and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is not completely known, but it is influenced by the presence of normal gut microflora as well as yet-unrecognized pathogens. The anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterial species Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common resident of the human mouth and gut and varies in its pathogenic potential. In this study, we demonstrate that highly invasive F. nucleatum isolates derived from the inflamed guts of Crohn's disease patients evoked significantly greater MUC2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression than minimally invasive strains isolated from the noninflamed gut in human colonic epithelial cells and in a rat ligated colonic loop model of infection. Only live F. nucleatum induced mucin secretion and TNF-alpha expression in direct contact with and/or during invasion of colonic cells. In rat colons, mucin secretion was augmented in response to a highly invasive F. nucleatum isolate but was unaffected by treatment with a minimally invasive strain. Taken together, these studies reveal that F. nucleatum may represent a challenging pathogen in the etiology of gut inflammatory diseases and highlight the importance of different pathotypes of candidate bacterial species in disease pathogenesis.
TI  - Spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - PURPOSE: The occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. In vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. RESULTS: A total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. Spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of Fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), Parvimonas micra (10.8%), Streptococcus constellatus (10%), Streptococcus intermedius (10%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and Tannerella forsythia (5.3%). Amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in P. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), T. forsythia (15.8%), S. constellatus (10%), F. nucleatum (5.6%), and P. micra (2.7%). Only S. constellatus (70%) and S. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. When subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each of S. constellatus and S. intermedius from one study subject. Similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except S. constellatus in one subject. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of United States origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival F. nucleatum species. In vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial efficacy in non-Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus modulates the Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced epithelial  interleukin-8 response through the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We previously reported that the interleukin-8 (IL-8) response to Fusobacterum nucleatum was attenuated in the presence of Streptococcus cristatus. Here, we further examined the underlying mechanism(s) involved in the modulating effect of S. cristatus by looking specifically at its impact on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway under the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling background. MATERIAL AND METHODS: OKF6/TERT-2 and KB cells were co-cultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination. Secretion of IL-8 protein was measured by ELISA. The nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was evaluated by confocal microscopy, while DNA-binding activity was quantified using TransAM ELISA kits. Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of S. cristatus is related to the modulation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha. RESULTS: Incubation with F. nucleatum significantly enhanced the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Exposure to S. cristatus alone did not cause detectable NF-kappaB translocation and was able to inhibit the F. nucleatum-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. The TransAM assay further confirmed that S. cristatus blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in response to F. nucleatum stimulation. In contrast to the nearly complete degradation of IkappaB-alpha induced by F. nucleatum alone, the presence of S. cristatus stabilized IkappaB-alpha. Pre-incubation with TLR2 and TLR4 antibodies, however, did not affect the epithelial response to either species alone or in combination. CONCLUSION: The mechanism by which S. cristatus attenuates F. nucleatum-induced proinflammatory responses in oral epithelial cells appears to involve blockade of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation at the level of IkappaB-alpha degradation.
TI  - Antigenicity of primary endodontic infection against macrophages by the levels of PGE(2) production.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Root canal contents are potent stimuli for proinflammatory cytokines involved in apical periodontitis. This study investigated target gram-negative bacterial species and endotoxins in primary endodontic infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of PGE(2), and evaluated their relationship with clinical findings. METHODS: Samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary infection and apical periodontitis by using paper points. Polymerase chain reaction (16S rDNA) was used for bacterial detection and limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement. Levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Duoset Kit; R&D, Minneapolis, MN). RESULTS: Prevotella nigrescens (13/21), Fusobacterium nucleatum (6/21), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (6/21) were the most frequently observed species. A positive association was found between F. nucleatum and P. endodontalis (P < .05). A correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins, such as PGE(2) (P < .05). Higher levels of endotoxin were detected in teeth with exudation, whereas elevated levels of PGE(2) were found in teeth with tenderness to percussion and pain on palpation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply an additive effect between the number of gram-negative bacterial species involved in endodontic infection regarding the induction of proinflammatory cytokine by macrophage cells. Moreover, teeth with clinical symptomatology were related to higher levels of endotoxins and PGE(2) secretion.
TI  - Identification and enzymic analysis of a novel protein associated with production of hydrogen sulfide and L-serine from L-cysteine in Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586.
AB  - A third enzyme that produces hydrogen sulfide from L-cysteine was identified in Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum. The fn1055 gene was cloned from a cosmid library constructed with genomic DNA of F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. Despite the database annotation that the product of fn1055 is a cysteine synthase, reverse-phase HPLC revealed that no L-cysteine was produced in vitro by the purified Fn1055 protein; however, the enzyme did produce L-serine. In addition, a cysteine auxotroph, Escherichia coli NK3, transformed with a plasmid containing the fn1055 gene did not grow without cysteine, which further suggests that Fn1055 does not function as a cysteine synthase. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) =0.09 +/- 0.001 mM and k(cat) =5.43 +/- 0.64 s(-1)) of the purified enzyme showed that the capacity of Fn1055 to produce hydrogen sulfide was between that of two other enzymes, Fn0625 and Fn1220. Incubation of Fn1055 with L-cysteine resulted in the production of hydrogen sulfide, but not of pyruvate, ammonia or lanthionine, which are all byproducts produced in addition to hydrogen sulfide when Fn0625 or Fn1220 is incubated with L-cysteine. Instead, Fn1055 produced L-serine in its reaction with L-cysteine. Fn1055 produces hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine by a mechanism that is different from that of Fn0625 or Fn1220.
TI  - Influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (Ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces israelii, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus sanguinis were tested on Ti surfaces: pretreatment (PT [R(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (A [R(a) <0.8 mum]), A modified to be hydrophilic (modA), sand-blasted/acid-etched (SLA [R(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic SLA (modSLA). Disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (CM) or human saliva (HS). The total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with CM compared with the samples incubated with HS. PT, SLA, and modSLA exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in CM, whereas SLA and modSLA had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in HS. The proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: SLA and modSLA increased the proportion of species like A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of A. israelii and P. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSIONS: The initial biofilm formation and composition were affected by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.
TI  - Microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  - AIM: To monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. Significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. Supragingival counts of Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. Subgingival counts were greater for Actinomyces, green and orange complex species. Significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0 at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked in periodontitis.
TI  - Analysis of interspecies adherence of oral bacteria using a membrane binding assay coupled with polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling.
AB  - Information on co-adherence of different oral bacterial species is important for  understanding interspecies interactions within oral microbial community. Current knowledge on this topic is heavily based on pariwise coaggregation of known, cultivable species. In this study, we employed a membrane binding assay coupled with polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) to systematically analyze the co-adherence profiles of oral bacterial species, and achieved a more profound knowledge beyond pairwise coaggregation. Two oral bacterial species were selected to serve as "bait": Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) whose ability to adhere to a multitude of oral bacterial species has been extensively studied for pairwise interactions and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) whose interacting partners are largely unknown. To enable screening of interacting partner species within bacterial mixtures, cells of the "bait" oral bacterium were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes which were washed and blocked to prevent unspecific binding. The "prey" bacterial mixtures (including known species or natural saliva samples) were added, unbound cells were washed off after the incubation period and the remaining cells were eluted using 0.2 mol x L(-1) glycine. Genomic DNA was extracted, subjected to 16S rRNA PCR amplification and separation of the resulting PCR products by DGGE. Selected bands were recovered from the gel, sequenced and identified via Nucleotide BLAST searches against different databases. While few bacterial species bound to S. mutans, consistent with previous findings F. nucleatum adhered to a variety of bacterial species including uncultivable and uncharacterized ones. This new approach can more effectively analyze the co-adherence profiles of oral bacteria, and could facilitate the systematic study of interbacterial binding of oral microbial species.
TI  - Multispecies communities: interspecies interactions influence growth on saliva as sole nutritional source.
AB  - Human oral bacteria live in multispecies communities in the biofilm called dental plaque. This review focuses on the interactions of seven species and the ability of each species individually and together with other species to grow on saliva as the sole source of nutrient. Community formation in biofilms in flow cells is monitored using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated immunoglobulin G, and images are captured by confocal microscopy. Early colonizing veillonellae emerge from this review of interspecies interactions in saliva as a critical genus that guides the development of multispecies communities. Highly selective interspecies recognition is evident as initial colonizers pair with early and middle colonizers to form multispecies communities that grow on saliva.
TI  - The oral commensal, Streptococcus gordonii, synergizes with Tat protein to induce HIV-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  - Trans-activator of transcription (Tat) is an HIV-1 protein essential for viral replication. Oral periodontopathogens (e.g. Fusobacterium nucleatum) enhance HIV-1LTR promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages in absence of Tat; however, some oral commensals fail to trigger this response. We sought to determine the effect of Tat on HIV-1LTR promoter activation induced by the representative oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii in monocytes/macrophages. S. gordonii enhanced HIV-1LTR reactivation in THP89GFP (Tat(+)), but not in BF24 (Tat(-)) cells. Interestingly, S. gordonii, but not Streptococcus sanguinis enhanced HIV-1LTR activation in the presence of recombinant Tat in BF24 cells. This response correlated with IL-8 but not TNFalpha or IL-6 production, and was abrogated by the NFkappaB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. Kinetics of NFkappaB-RelA activation did not explain the S. gordonii-induced HIV-1LTR activation in presence of Tat. These results suggest that S. gordonii-induced HIV-1 reactivation in monocytes/macrophages is Tat-dependent and appears to involve NFkappaB activation.
TI  - Detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. The available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. The main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. METHODS: Atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial DNA was extracted. To obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16S ribosomal-RNA gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A nested PCR with specific primers for the target bacteria was performed next. Statistical tests included the chi(2) test. RESULTS: Forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. All of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. The bacterial species most commonly found was Porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%; 28 of 42), Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42), Eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), Fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and Campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). The simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, the presence of DNA from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.
TI  - MPC-polymer reduces adherence and biofilm formation by oral bacteria.
AB  - Oral biofilms such as dental plaque cause dental caries and periodontitis, as well as aspiration pneumonia and infectious endocarditis by translocation. Hence, the suppression of oral biofilm formation is an issue of considerable importance. Mechanical removal, disinfectants, inhibition of polysaccharide formation, and artificial sugar have been used for the reduction of oral biofilm. From the viewpoint of the inhibition of bacterial adherence, we investigated whether aqueous biocompatible 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-polymer can reduce streptococcal colonization and biofilm formation. We examined the effects of MPC-polymer on streptococcal adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and oral epithelial cells, and the adherence of Fusobacterium nucleatum to streptococcal biofilm. MPC-polymer application markedly inhibited both the adherence and biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and streptococcal adherence to oral epithelial cells, and reduced the adherence of F. nucleatum to streptococcal biofilms. A small-scale clinical trial revealed that mouthrinsing with MPC-polymer inhibited the increase of oral bacterial numbers, especially of S. mutans. These findings suggest that MPC-polymer is a potent inhibitor of bacterial adherence and biofilm development, and may be useful to prevent dental-plaque-related diseases.

TI  - Structural basis of cooperative ligand binding by the glycine riboswitch.
AB  - The glycine riboswitch regulates gene expression through the cooperative recognition of its amino acid ligand by a tandem pair of aptamers. A 3.6 A crystal structure of the tandem riboswitch from the glycine permease operon of Fusobacterium nucleatum reveals the glycine binding sites and an extensive network of interactions, largely mediated by asymmetric A-minor contacts, that serve to communicate ligand binding status between the aptamers. These interactions provide a structural basis for how the glycine riboswitch cooperatively regulates gene expression.
TI  - [Study of putative periodontal pathogens colonies in type 2 diabetes with chronic periodontitis].
AB  - PPURPOSE: To study the permanent planting of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque of periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes, and evaluate role of periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred and twenty subgingival plaque samples were collected from 90 severe periodontitis and 30 healthy periodontium patients with type 2 diabetes. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Aggregatibacer actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Tannerella forsythia (Tf) and Treponema denticola (Td) were taken as aim pathogens, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection was used to determine the prevalence of Pg, Aa, Fn, Pi, Tf, Td in the subgingival plaque samples.The average gradation(AVG)of positive band in the agarose gel electrophoresis was analyzed to determine the proportion of Pg, Aa, Fn, Pi, Tf, Td in the subgingival plaque. Chi-square test, t test and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the relationship between the periodontal pathogens and blood glucose and blood lipid. RESULTS: The level of triglyceridey(TC) in Tf positive subjects was significantly higher than that in Tf negative subjects, the proportion of Tf in subgingival plaque was positively correlated with the value of fasting blood glucose(FBG). The proportion of Pg was positively correlated with the level of TC. The proportion of Pi was negatively correlated with the value of FBG and TC. CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetes can affect the permanent planting of some putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  - Novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  - Oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. Oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. To provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (RGPLs), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. Bacterial species belonging to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or three-species biofilms, with each group comprising Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis; S. gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum; or S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in single-species and multispecies biofilms. We evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and Hoechst 33258 and novel SYTO red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. The specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.
TI  - Microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (Er:YAG) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. METHODS: In a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an Er:YAG laser or an air-abrasive device. Routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. Baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (PD) at the implant. Non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. RESULTS: PD reductions (mean +/- SD) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). No baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. In the air-abrasive group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (P <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (P = 0.002), and Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (P = 0.002). Both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. Porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: At 1 month, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group, and Fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. Six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. Clinical improvements were limited.
TI  - Four cases of bacteraemia caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in febrile, neutropenic patients.
AB  - Although bacteraemia caused by obligate anaerobic bacteria is a rare event, this  phenomenon will be an emerging problem among oncohaematological patients. We report four cases of bacteraemia caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in febrile, neutropenic patients over a 10 month period. All patients had haematological malignancy and severe neutropenia, and three of them suffered from oral mucositis or oedema of the oral mucosal surfaces, which was the probable portal of entry. All isolated strains were susceptible to standard anti-anaerobic antibiotics.
TI  - Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli
AB  - At present there are over two dozen genera of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. In most clinical infections, only the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium need be considered. These genera are prevalent in the body as members of the normal flora (Fig.20-1), constituting one-third of the total anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens, and may become involved in infections throughout the body (Fig.20-2). Within the Bacteroides group, B fragilis is the most common pathogen, followed by B thetaiotaomicron and other members of the B fragilis group. Among the bile-sensitive Prevotella species, the ones most commonly encountered clinically are P melaninogenica, P oris, and P buccae. Porphyromonas species seem to be much less pathogenic except in dental infections. Fusobacterium nucleatum is the Fusobacterium species most often found as a pathogen, but F necrophorum occasionally produces serious disease. These genera contain numerous other species that rarely or never infect humans.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, results are inconsistent. The aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with RA. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with RA, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. The periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (PSR/PSI) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (PSR/PSI score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant PSR/PSI score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant PSR/PSI score 4). Pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. Statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. RESULTS: No patients were periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. For most patients, Fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), Eikenella corrodens (91%), and Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. Strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); Porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis, 78%). Statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (P = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (P >0.05). Only smoking showed a significant influence (P = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of E. corrodens (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with RA in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. No association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.
TI  - Modeling of diffusion transport through oral biofilms with the inverse problem method.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the passive transport of macromolecules within dental biofilms. METHODOLOGY: Fluorescently labeled dextrans with different molecular mass (3 kD, 10 kD, 40 kD, 70 kD, 2000 kD) were used as a series of diffusion probes. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were used as inocula for biofilm formation. The diffusion processes of different probes through the in vitro biofilm were recorded with a confocal laser microscope. RESULTS: Mathematical function of biofilm penetration was constructed on the basis of the inverse problem method. Based on this function, not only the relationship between average concentration of steady-state and molecule weights can be analyzed, but also that between penetrative time and molecule weights. CONCLUSION: This can be used to predict the effective concentration and the penetrative time of anti-biofilm medicines that can diffuse through oral biofilm. Furthermore, an improved model for large molecule is proposed by considering the exchange time at the upper boundary of the dental biofilm.
TI  - Clinical spectrum of bacteraemic Fusobacterium infections: from septic shock to nosocomial bacteraemia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium species are anaerobic bacteria that relatively rarely cause sepsis with a variable clinical presentation. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 52 consecutive patients who had Fusobacterium bacteraemia over a 10-y period. RESULTS: The clinical pictures could be classified into 4 groups: (1) patients who had Lemierre's syndrome with Fusobacterium necrophorum sepsis and internal jugular vein thrombosis, n = 5 (10%); (2) previously healthy patients who had F. necrophorum sepsis without any signs of macroscopic vascular thrombosis (but 5 of them had abscesses), n = 14 (27%); (3) women who had puerperal infections, n = 6 (12%); and (4) patients who were on average older than the patients in the previous groups, who had cardiovascular, pulmonary, neoplastic, or other underlying diseases, n = 27 (52%). Of these latter 27 patients, 23 had nosocomial Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteraemia presenting as a febrile illness associated with chemotherapy or instrumentation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic underlying diseases are more likely to be infected with F. nucleatum than F. necrophorum. F. nucleatum bacteraemia may present as a febrile illness without severe symptoms. F. necrophorum caused sepsis mainly in previously healthy individuals. These infections may be accompanied with a jugular vein thrombosis characteristic of Lemierre's syndrome and septic shock. However, F. necrophorum infections present more frequently without any apparent venous thrombosis and may be accompanied by abscesses.
TI  - Myrsinoic acid B inhibits the production of hydrogen sulfide by periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - Recently, we reported that myrsinoic acid B purified from Myrsine seguinii inhibited methyl mercaptan (CH(3)SH) production by Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532. Since hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is the main component of physiological halitosis, while CH(3)SH is involved in pathological oral halitosis, the objective of this study is to determine whether myrsinoic acid B inhibits H(2)S production by oral microorganisms. F. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola were incubated with myrsinoic acid B and a substrate such as l-cysteine or l-methionine. H(2)S or CH(3)SH concentration in the headspace air, was determined using a gas chromatograph. The concentration of myrsinoic acid B inhibiting 50% (IC(50)) of H(2)S production by F. nucleatum was 0.142 microg ml(-1), and the IC(50) of P. gingivalis and T. denticola were 2.71 microg ml(-1) and 28.9 microg ml(-1), respectively. The presence of pyruvate, a by-product of H(2)S production, was determined. The IC(50) values of myrsinoic acid B for pyruvate production were 22.9 microg ml(-1) for F. nucleatum, 87.7 microg ml(-1) for P. gingivalis and 165 microg ml(-1) for T. denticola. We concluded that myrsinoic acid B inhibited the production of both H(2)S and pyruvate by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - In-vivo-induced antigenic determinants of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum plays a pivotal role in dental plaque biofilm formation and is known to be involved in chronic inflammatory systemic disease. However, limited knowledge of F. nucleatum genes expressed in vivo interferes with our understanding of pathogenesis. In this study, we identified F. nucleatum genes induced in vivo using in-vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT). Among 30,000 recombinant clones screened, 87 reacted reproducibly with pooled sera from 10 patients with periodontitis. The clones encoded for 32 different proteins, of which 28 could be assigned to their functions, which were categorized in translation, transcription, transport, energy metabolism, cell envelope, cellular process, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, transposition, cofactor biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and DNA replication. Putative virulence factors detected were ABC transporter, butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase, hemin receptor, hemolysin, hemolysin-related protein, LysR family transcriptional regulator, serine protease, and transposase. Analysis of immune responses to the in-vivo-induced (ivi) antigens in five patients demonstrated that most were reactive to these proteins, confirming results with pooled sera. IVIAT-identified F. nucleatum genes in this study may accelerate the elucidation of F. nucleatum-mediated molecular pathogenesis.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced cytokine expression by influencing pathways converging on nuclear factor-kappaB.
AB  - We previously reported that Streptococcus cristatus, an oral commensal, was able  to downregulate the interleukin-8 (IL-8) response to Fusobacterium nucleatum, a putative oral pathogen in oral epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to extend the understanding of how S. cristatus regulates cytokine expression in oral epithelial cells on a broad basis, and investigate whether the modulation of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway was involved in this process. KB and TERT-2 cells were co-cultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination. Total RNA was extracted and pathway-specific focused microarrays were used to profile the transcriptional responses of various cytokine genes and those related to TLR-mediated signal transduction. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and protein assays were performed to confirm the microarray results for selected genes. We found that exposure to either S. cristatus or F. nucleatum alone led to distinct changes in cytokine expression patterns. Fusobacterium nucleatum induced a greater number of gene expression changes than S. cristatus (15% vs. 4%, respectively). The presence of S. cristatus with F. nucleatum attenuated the expression of a number of inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated several anti-inflammatory mediators. The RT-PCR confirmed the messenger RNA attenuation of IL-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 by S. cristatus. Profiling of TLR-signaling-related genes revealed that S. cristatus most significantly impacted the downstream pathways, especially nuclear factor-kappaB, rather than altering TLRs and their adaptors and interacting proteins. Our data suggest that S. cristatus may attenuate the epithelial proinflammatory cytokine response to F. nucleatum by influencing pathways converging on nuclear factor-kappaB.
TI  - RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique (ROQT) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  - Approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. The aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. Oligonucleotides targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. These probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. Target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as TM7 sp. OT 346, Mitsuokella sp. OT 131 and Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041. Sensitivity and specificity of the probes were determined. A Universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. Sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. Chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a CCD camera. In a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. Probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and Actinomyces gerencseriae were the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. Among uncultivated/unrecognized species, Mitsuokella sp. OT 131 and Prevotella sp. OT 306 were the most numerous. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. Direct hybridization of total nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.
TI  - Association between periodontal pathogens and risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The direct effect of periodontal pathogens on atherosclerotic plaque  development has been suggested as a potential mechanism for the observed association between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease, but few studies have tested this theory. OBJECTIVES: (i) To assess the association of periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets with the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and (ii) to assess whether an increase in the number of periodontal bacterial species increases the risk of MI. METHODS: A total of 313 cases and 747 controls, consisting of Caucasian men and women from Western New York, aged 35 to 69 years, were recruited for this study. The presence of microorganisms was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, using species-specific polyclonal and monoclonal serodiagnostic reagents. The presence of six periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Campylobacter recta (Cr), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), and Eubacterium saburreum (Es), and their co-occurrence (0-6) was compared with the odds of having myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed a higher percentage of the presence of each bacterium in cases compared to controls. In multivariate analyses, only Tf and Pi were statistically associated with an increase in the odds of having MI [Odds ratio OR=1.62; 95% CI (1.18-2.22); and 1.40; 95% (1.02-1.92), respectively] after adjusting for age, gender, education, cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and total pack-years of cigarette smoking. An increase in the number of different periodontal bacteria in pockets was also found to increase the odds of MI [adjusted OR=1.14; 95% CI (1.03-1.26)]. Participants who had three species or more of periodontal pathogens had about 2-fold increase in odds of having nonfatal MI than those who did not have any type of bacterial species [OR=2.01 (1.31-3.08)]. CONCLUSION: The presence of periodontal pathogens, specifically Tf or Pi, and an increase in total burden of periodontal pathogenic species were both associated with increased odds of having MI. However, further studies are needed to better assess any causal relationship, as well as the biological mechanisms underlying this association.
TI  - Salivary blood group antigens and microbial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Secretor is an individual with ability to produce blood group reactive substances in the exocrine glands and to secrete these substances in the body fluids such as saliva. In saliva the blood reactive antigens are found primarily on mucins which exhibit microheterogenicity and different subtypes of these molecules. This study was done to find out if the salivary blood group antigens have any role in the adherence of certain selected microorganism in the oral cavity. METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected from subjects with clinically healthy gingival, chronic gingivitis and chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth >/=4mm and attachment loss >/=1mm. Secretor status was determined by using Haemagglutination Inhibition Assay. Unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected to culture and isolate the selected microorganisms. The clinical scores, secretor status and the presence or absence of selected microorganisms were compared within the groups using Chi-square test and students unpaired t-test. RESULTS: The numbers of secretors were more in the healthy group (22.2%) and non secretors were more in the chronic periodontitis group (22.2%). The clinical scores were higher in the in non secretors compared to the secretors in all the three groups. P intermedia and P gingivalis were prevalent among non secretors in chronic gingivitis group. (P=0.075 and P=0.032) and chronic periodontitis group (P=0.068 and P=0.009).
TI  - Short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (C1), acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), butyric acid (C4), isobutyric acid (C4), isovaleric acid (C5), hexanoic acid (C6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (C8), capric acid (C10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. As a group the fatty acids were much less effective against C. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. Formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. Interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. First, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. Second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. Further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.
TI  - The role of acidification in the inhibition of Neisseria gonorrhoeae by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal lactobacilli protect the female genital tract by producing lactic acid, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide or a local immune response. In bacterial vaginosis, normal lactobacilli are replaced by an anaerobic flora and this may increase susceptibility to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a facultative anaerobe. Bacterial interference between vaginal lactobacilli and N. gonorrhoeae has not been studied in liquid medium under anaerobic conditions. By co-cultivating N. gonorrhoeae in the presence of lactobacilli we sought to identify the relative contributions of acidification and hydrogen peroxide production to any growth inhibition of N. gonorrhoeae. METHODS: Three strains of N. gonorrhoeae distinguishable by auxotyping were grown in the presence of high concentrations (107-108 cfu/mL) of three vaginal lactobacilli (L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii) in an anerobic liquid medium with and without 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic (MES) buffer. Fusobacterium nucleatum was used as an indicator of anaerobiosis. Bacterial counts were performed at 15, 20 and 25 h; at 25 h pH and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Growth of F. nucleatum to >108 cfu/mL at 25 h confirmed anaerobiosis. All bacteria grew in the anaerobic liquid medium and the addition of MES buffer had negligible effect on growth. L. crispatus and L. gasseri produced significant acidification and a corresponding reduction in growth of N. gonorrhoeae. This inhibition was abrogated by the addition of MES. L. jensenii produced less acidification and did not inhibit N. gonorrhoeae. Hydrogen peroxide was not detected in any experiment. CONCLUSIONS: During anaerobic growth, inhibition of N. gonorrhoeae by the vaginal lactobacilli tested was primarily due to acidification and abrogated by the presence of a buffer. There was no evidence of a specific mechanism of inhibition other than acid production under these conditions and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide was not produced. The acidification potential of vaginal lactobacilli under anaerobic conditions may be their most important characteristic conferring protection against N. gonorrhoeae infection.
TI  - The origin of Fusobacterium nucleatum involved in intra-amniotic infection and preterm birth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential oral origin of Fusobacterium nucleatum found in amniotic fluid of women at high risk of preterm birth. METHODS: A transversal study nested into a cohort study of women with preterm labor and/or preterm premature rupture of membranes was undergone. Women with the presence of F. nucleatum in the amniotic fluid and their respective partners were invited to be examined for their periodontal health after delivery, and samples of saliva and subgingival plaque were collected. For each couple, specific PCR detection of Fusobacterium species was performed on each oral sample, and the DNA sequences were compared with the one obtained from amniotic fluid. RESULTS: Three women, all in preterm labor with intact membranes, were included. Intra-amniotic sludge was observed in all of them. A strain of F. nucleatum with 100% sequence identity with the strain detected in the amniotic fluid was found in the oral samples of one of them and of two partners. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that intra-amniotic F. nucleatum could originate from the patient's or the partner's oral microflora.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Effect of non-surgical treatment on chronic and aggressive periodontitis: clinical, immunologic, and microbiologic findings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our goal was to examine differences in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses to non-surgical mechanical therapy in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (GCP) and generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). METHODS: Twenty patients with GCP and 14 patients with GAgP were evaluated. Clinical data, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. GCF interleukin (IL)-1beta, -4, and -8 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were analyzed using a multiplexed bead immunoassay, and elastase activity was measured using an enzymatic assay. The significance of changes with time was examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters after therapy were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: After periodontal therapy, we found significant improvements for all clinical parameters in both groups. We also observed significant reductions in elastase activity in shallow and deep sites from the GAgP group and in deep sites from the GCP group. Microbiologic data showed significant reductions in proportions of orange and red complexes and an increase in proportions of Actinomyces species in both clinical groups. When the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses after therapy were compared between groups, only minor differences were found. CONCLUSION: This study fails to show any significant differences between severe forms of GCP and GAgP in response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.
TI  - Assessing the efficacy of vesicle fusion with planar membrane arrays using a mitochondrial porin as reporter.
AB  - Reconstitution of functionally active membrane protein into artificially made lipid bilayers is a challenge that must be overcome to create a membrane-based biomimetic sensor and separation device. In this study we address the efficacy of proteoliposome fusion with planar membrane arrays. We establish a protein incorporation efficacy assay using the major non-specific porin of Fusobacterium nucleatum (FomA) as reporter. We use electrical conductance measurements and fluorescence microscopy to characterize proteoliposome fusion with an array of planar membranes. We show that protein reconstitution in biomimetic membrane arrays may be quantified using the developed FomA assay. Specifically, we show that FomA vesicles are inherently fusigenic. Optimal FomA incorporation is obtained with a proteoliposome lipid-to-protein molar ratio (LPR)=50 more than 10(5) FomA proteins could be incorporated in a bilayer array with a total membrane area of 2mm(2) within 20 min. This novel assay for quantifying protein delivery into lipid bilayers may be a useful tool in developing biomimetic membrane applications.
TI  - Effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. Ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. Agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. Then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. Further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against Porphyromonas gingivalis. This result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. Only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans) survived in part. Addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. The bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included A. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. In conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. Ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of dentifrices on human oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In vitro testing of antimicrobial agents is an important tool in the testing hierarchy, and may provide interesting insights into their potential clinical efficacy. Agents with demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity may be effective against the same microorganisms in vivo, whereas agents without demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity are unlikely to exhibit in vivo antimicrobial activity. In addition, these methods may also be useful in screening antimicrobial agents in product formulations because such agents with both in vitro and in vivo activity may have reduced antimicrobial effects when formulated into a dentifrice. Accordingly, this study examined the in vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial activity of three commercial dentifrices: one formulated with 0.243% sodium fluoride (Crest Cavity Protection Toothpaste-Regular); one with 0.454% stannous fluoride, sodium hexametaphosphate, and zinc lactate (Crest Pro-Health), and one with 0.3% triclosan, 2.0% PVM/MA copolymer, and 0.243% sodium fluoride (Colgate Total). METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each dentifrice was determined for resident oral bacterial species, including bacteria that are associated with dental caries; periodontitis, and oral halitosis. Evaluations were performed on individual laboratory strains, and on oral bacteria from supragingival plaque samples obtained from 10 adults and from oral rinse samples obtained from 18 adults. RESULTS: The lowest MICs against the oral strains and human samples, i.e., greatest antimicrobial activity, were seen for the triclosan/ copolymer dentifrice. There was, in general, a four-fold difference in MICs between the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice. The triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited periodontal pathogens, such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth after 30-, 60-, and 120-second exposures compared to the sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrices. Similarly, in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects on supragingival plaque biofilms, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth compared to the other test dentifrices. CONCLUSION: Different in vitro and ex vivo analyses show that the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice has significant antimicrobial activity on oral bacteria, including species causing dental caries, periodontitis, and oral halitosis, and it provides superior efficacy compared to the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice.
TI  - Structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. The selected species represent initial (Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces naeslundii), early (Veillonella parvula), secondary (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). The structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: After 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. The intermediate colonizer F. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. Late colonizers A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. The biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. CONCLUSION: An in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. This study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. Each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia and Epstein-Barr virus were identified using the TaqMan real-time PCR methodology. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. RESULTS: C. rectus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and T. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. A. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of Epstein-Barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. The diagnostic sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for P. gingivalis and for T. forsythia and 86.49 for P. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. The optimal copy-counts per mL saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for P. gingivalis, 700,000 for T. forsythia and 910,000 for P. intermedia. CONCLUSION: Salivary copy-counts of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and P. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. Longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.
TI  - [A case of liver abscess caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in a patient with recurrent periodontal diseases].
AB  - Fusobacteria are anaerobic gram-negative, non-spore forming bacilli found in normal flora of the oral cavity, urogenital tract, and gastrointestinal tract. Fusobacterium nucleatum has been seldom reported as a cause of liver abscess, particularly in immunocompetent hosts. A 55-year-old man with frequent periodontal disease visited our hospital with intermittent fever and headache for 2 months. Abdominal CT scan revealed an 8.2 x 6 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe with central low density. Abscess culture revealed F. nucleatum as the causative organism. Percutaneous abscess drainage and intravenous administration of antibiotics for 4 weeks improved symptoms and decreased the abscess size. We report a rare case of liver abscess due to F. nucleatum in an immunocompetent man with periodontal disease.
TI  - [Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from a patient presenting lachrymal canaliculitis].
AB  - A 68-year-old woman presented with a painless inflammation of the right superior  eyelid that had started several weeks before. The clinical diagnosis concluded in canaliculitis and the solid concretions were surgically extracted from the superior canalicula. The anaerobic bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum was isolated. Signs dramatically regressed two weeks after surgery followed by one course of oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid associated with topical tobramycin. The clinical signs had disappeared two months later.
TI  - Epigenetic regulation of human beta-defensin 2 and CC chemokine ligand 20 expression in gingival epithelial cells in response to oral bacteria.
AB  - Gingival epithelia utilize multiple signaling pathways to regulate innate immune  responses to various oral bacteria, but little is understood about how these bacteria alter epithelial epigenetic status. In this study we report that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase expression were decreased in gingival epithelial cells treated with oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and nonpathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum. Pretreatment with trichostatin A and sodium butyrate, which increase acetylation of chromatin histones, significantly enhanced the gene expression of antimicrobial proteins human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) and CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) in response to both bacterial challenges. Pretreatment with DNMT inhibitor 5'-azacytidine increased hBD2 and CCL20 expression in response to F. nucleatum, but not to P. gingivalis. Furthermore, we observed a differential pattern of protein levels of H3K4me3, which has been associated with chromatin remodeling and activation of gene transcription, in response to P. gingivalis vs. F. nucleatum. This study provides a new insight into the bacteria-specific innate immune responses via epigenetic regulation.
TI  - Effects of toluidine blue-mediated photodynamic therapy on periopathogens and periodontal biofilm: in vitro evaluation.
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a selective modality of killing targeted cells, mostly known for its application in neoplasms. PDT can be considered to be an alternative method for the elimination of periodontal bacteria from the pocket without harms for the resident tissues. Therefore, PDT may replace systemic antibiotics and enhance the effect of mechanical treatments of periodontal defects. This effort focused on the in vitro sensitization of periopathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia ) Toluidine Blue mediated and on the use of a Diode laser emitting source. The objective of this research was to evaluate the bactericidal in vitro effect of laser diodes 830 nm (as the light source) after photosensitization with Toluidine Blue (TBO) on the following periopathogenic bacteria: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia. After evaluating the effect on the single bacterial strain, the ability of Diode Laser to disrupt the structure of biofilms produced by A. actinomycetemcomitans after photosensitization with TBO was also analyzed. The study suggests that the association of TBO and diode laser light 830 nm is effective for the killing of bacteria strains and determines the photoinactivation of Aggregatibacter biofilms. In summary, photodynamic therapy has effectively shown its capabilities and, therefore, it can be considered a valid alternative approach to antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum in periodontal health and disease.
AB  - The pathogenesis of periodontitis involves the interplay of microbiota present in the subgingival plaque and the host responses. Inflammation and destruction of periodontal tissues are considered to result from the response of a susceptible host to a microbial biofilm containing gram-negative pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides are important contributors to maintaining the balance between health and disease in this complex environment. These include several salivary antimicrobial peptides such as beta-defensins expressed in the epithelium and LL-37 expressed in both epithelium and neutrophils. Among gram-negative bacteria implicated in periodontal diseases, Fusobacterium nucleatum, is one of the most interesting. This review will focus on expression, function, regulation and functional efficacy of antimicrobial peptides against F. nucleatum. We are looking for how the presence of F. nucleatum induces secretion of peptides which have an impact on host cells and modulate immune response.
TI  - Killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  - Recently, the predation of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. The current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. A number of representatives from the Bdellovibrio, Bacteriovorax and Peredibacter lineages (called 'BALOs') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. As the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon, it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of BALOs. It was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. This finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for BALOs to combat periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Predation of oral pathogens by Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109J.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the destruction of the periodontal structures. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. It was previously shown that B. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. In this study, we examined the host specificity of B. bacteriovorus strain 109J and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. We further demonstrated that B. bacteriovorus 109J has an ability to remove biofilms of Ei. corrodens as well as biofilms composed of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was able to remove A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. Experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of B. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-K inhibits predation. However, treating A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with DspB, a poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. Increased biofilm removal was also recorded when A. actinomycetemcomitans PGA-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that PGA degradation could enhance the removal of A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by B. bacteriovorus.
TI  - Effect of nicotine, cotinine and cigarette smoke extract on the neutrophil respiratory burst.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of nicotine, cotinine and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on the neutrophil respiratory burst and their effect on activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) pathway in oral epithelium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neutrophils from periodontally healthy individuals were treated with nicotine, cotinine and CSE before stimulation with Fusobacterium nucleatum, IgG-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Total and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined by luminol/isoluminol chemiluminescence. Activation of NFkappaB in oral epithelial cells was determined by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Smoke extract alone caused increased neutrophil extracellular isoluminol-dependent chemiluminescence, not detectable with luminol. However, pre-treatment with smoke extract reduced both total and extracellular ROS generation in response to all stimuli. Nicotine and cotinine had no effect on the neutrophil respiratory burst. Smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine did not induce oral epithelial cell NFkappaB activation. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that smoke extract reduces the ability of neutrophils to generate ROS after stimulation with F. nucleatum and IgG-opsonized S. aureus but, at high concentrations, stimulates extracellular ROS generation. During periodontitis, cigarette smoking may differentially affect neutrophil function, generally preventing elimination of periodontal pathogens but, in heavy smokers, also stimulating ROS release and oxidative stress mediated tissue damage.
TI  - Identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. DESIGN: Nineteen patients with CP without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with CP and CKD who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with CP and CKD who were on renal replacement therapy (RRT group) were examined. The severity of CP was based on the investigation of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The definition and stage of CKD were based on the criteria proposed by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the equation of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Candida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on RRT and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. CP was more severe in patients with CKD. A strong association was observed between the frequency of C. albicans (P = 0.056), P.gingivalis (P = 0.008), T. denticola (P = 0.013) and CAL, when CKD patients were compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: CP is more severe and is associated with increased frequency of C. albicans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in patients with CKD.
TI  - Effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in Japan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. To clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. The aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of Japanese patients with periodontitis. METHODS: Sixty-seven Japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in the present study. They consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. Periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) and oral hygiene status were recorded. Detection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, Treponema denticola and Campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. Association between the detection of periodontopathic bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found between having a PPD >/= 4 mm and detection of T. denticola, P. intermedia, T. forsythia, or C. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. A significant association was noted between BOP and the detection of C. rectus or P. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. Prevalence of C. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of A. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including C. rectus.
TI  - Canine periodontal disease control using a clindamycin hydrochloride gel.
AB  - Stabilizing or reducing periodontal pocket depth can have a positive influence on the retention of teeth in dogs. A topical 2% clindamycin hydrochloride gel (CHgel) was evaluated for the treatment of periodontal disease in dogs. The CHgel formulation provides for the sustained erosion of the matrix, but also flows into the periodontal pocket as a viscous liquid, and then rapidly forms a gel that has mucoadhesive properties and also may function as a physical barrier to the introduction of bacteria. A professional teeth cleaning procedure including scaling and root planing was done in dogs with one group receiving CHgel following treatment. Periodontal health was determined before and after the procedure including measurement of periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, gingival bleeding sites, and number of suppurating sites. There was a statistically significant decrease in periodontal pocket depth (19%), gingival index (16%), and the number of bleeding sites (64%) at 90-days in dogs receiving CHgel. Additionally, the number of suppurating sites was lower (93%) at 90-days for the group receiving CHgel. The addition of CHgel effectively controlled the bacterial burden (e.g, Fusobacterium nucleatum) at both day 14 and 90. Gingival cells in culture were shown to rapidly incorporate clindamycin and attain saturation in approximately 20-minutes. In summary, a professional teeth cleaning procedure including root planning and the addition of CHgel improves the gingival index and reduces periodontal pocket depth.
TI  - [Detection of putative periodontal pathogens of periodontitis with type 2 diabetes].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the putative periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis (CP) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to discuss the role of the periodontal pathogens in the CP and type 2 DM patients. METHODS: The study included 154 CP patients with type 2 DM (DM graup), one hundred and twenty subjects with CP (CP group) and 40 healthy subjects. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained with sterile subgingival curettes and pathogens genomic DNA were extracted by phenol and chloroform from plaque. Taking Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Tannerella forsythia (Tf) and Treponema denticola (Td) as aim pathogens, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to determine the prevalence of Pg, Aa, Fn, Pi, Tf and Td in the subgingival plaque samples. RESULTS: Pg, Aa, Fn, Pi, Tf and Td were all found in the subgingival plaque of DM group. In serious periodontitis, the detection rate of Pg, Aa and Tf in DM group [Pg: 78% (72/92), Aa: 27% (25/92), Tf: 67% (62/92)] was significantly higher than in the CP group [Pg: 58% (35/60), Aa: 17% (10/60), Tf: 43% (26/60)], P < 0.05. In slight periodontitis, the detection rate of Pi in DM group was significantly lower than in the CP group. At the same time, the average gradation (AVG) ratio of PCR product of Aa and Tf in DM group was significantly higher than in the CP group and the AVG ratio of Pi in DM group was significantly lower than in the CP group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the pure CP, the quantity of Pg, Aa and Tf in the subgingival plaque of the periodontitis patients with type 2 DM increased, but the Pi quantity reduced.
TI  - Comparison of the use of the Halimeter and the Oral Chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of the Halimeter and the Oral Chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the Kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) with an optical density OD(550) of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile 15-ml head space vials. Reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mML-methionine and L-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees C for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 M phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. Production of VSCs was measured using the Halimeter and the Oral Chroma. RESULTS: The major VSC producers identified by both Halimeter and Oral Chroma with L-cystenine as substrate were Campylobacter ureolyticus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Gemella morbillorum. The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both Halimeter and Oral Chroma were essentially identical. With L-methionine as substrate, both Halimeter and Oral Chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with C. ureolyticus,P. gingivalis,Fusobacterium nucleatum and P. intermedia as major VSC producers. The concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the Halimeter were lower compared to those assessed by the Oral Chroma. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the Oral Chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of VSC production by oral microflora than the Halimeter.
TI  - Microbiota of dentinal caries as assessed by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to identify the microbiota of different layers  of dentinal caries by using a culture-independent molecular biology approach. METHODS: DNA was extracted from samples taken from 3 distinct layers (superficial, middle and deep) of advanced occlusal caries and analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 28 oral bacterial species/phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. RESULTS: The mean number of target taxa per layer was 7.7 (+/- 3.96) in the superficial, 7 (+/- 3.4) in the middle, and 6.3 (+/- 3.04) in the deep layer. No statistical significance was observed for these differences (p = 0.36). Overall, the most prevalent taxa in the 3 layers were Atopobium genomospecies C1 (72.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (69%), Lactobacillus casei (68%), Veillonella species (55%) and Lactobacillus fermentum (52%). No differences were found in the prevalence rates of the most frequent target species in the 3 layers. The most prevalent taxa found at levels above 10(5) in the advanced front line of deep-dentin caries were Atopobium genomospecies C1, F. nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus species and Veillonella species. CONCLUSION: The present results revealed that the prevalences of several established or candidate caries pathogens do not differ significantly in the different zones of dentinal caries lesions. The finding that some as-yet-uncharacterized species and novel species were found in high frequencies join other molecular studies to include them in the set of candidate caries pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of 4-hydroxycordoin: potential therapeutic benefits.
AB  - 4-Hydroxycordoin (1), a natural isopentenyloxychalcone, is a plant secondary metabolite that is relatively rare. Since there are very few reports about the biological activities of 1, its potential benefits for periodontal disease were investigated. A marked and dose-dependent antibacterial activity of 1 was observed against the three major periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Moreover, compound 1 showed an antiadhesion effect, since it inhibited attachment of P. gingivalis to oral epithelial cells. Finally, using a macrophage model, the ability of 1 to inhibit the secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated. The anti-inflammatory effect observed was associated with reduced activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways.
TI  - Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis with different primers of subgingival bacterial communities under mechanical debridement.
AB  - DGGE of 16S rDNA is one of the most frequently used methods to study microbial communities. In this study, the DGGE profiles of different 16S rDNA regions of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella nigrescens were investigated. The results suggested that V3-V5 and V6-V8 fragments may be suitable for community analysis of subgingival bacteria. Further analysis of subgingival samples with V3-V5 and V6-V8 regions as target fragments suggested that, in chronic periodontitis, re-colonization by periodontal bacteria with a population very similar to the baseline may occur by 6 weeks after mechanical debridement.
TI  - Development of a novel multi-triplex qPCR method for the assessment of bacterial  community structure in oral populations.
AB  - Gingivitis and dental caries are two of the most predominant diseases in humans.  Both conditions are easily treated with the removal of the plaque biofilm by brushing or the use of oral hygiene products. In both cases, pathogenic taxa found within the plaque biofilm are the causal agents of the disease. Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotalla intermedia have all been implicated in the development of gingivitis, while Streptococcus mutans is the main organism associated with dental caries. Many studies have so far focused on the use of culture methods to detect and enumerate the pathogenic taxa within plaque samples. However, these methods are both labour intensive and biased towards culturable taxa. In the present study, a novel high-throughput multi-triplex quantitative PCR method was developed with the aim to investigate the community dynamics associated with oral communities. Three triplex assays were designed targeting taxa associated with gingivitis and dental caries as well as oral health. Saliva samples collected from healthy individuals were used in order to validate the newly developed method.
TI  - Systemic inflammatory responses in progressing periodontitis during pregnancy in  a baboon model.
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that pregnant female baboons exhibit increased levels of various inflammatory mediators in serum resulting from ligature-induced periodontitis, and that these profiles would relate to periodontal disease severity/extent in the animals. The animals were sampled at baseline (B), mid-pregnancy (MP; two quadrants ligated) and at delivery (D; four quadrants ligated). All baboons developed increased plaque, gingival inflammation and bleeding, pocket depths and attachment loss following placement of the ligatures. By MP, both prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and bactericidal permeability inducing factor (BPI) were greater than baseline, while increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6 occurred in the experimental animals by the time of delivery. IL-8, MCP-1 and LBP all decreased from baseline through the ligation phase of the study. Stratification of the animals by baseline clinical presentation demonstrated that PGE(2), LBP, IL-8 and MCP-1 levels were altered throughout the ligation interval, irrespective of baseline clinical values. IL-6, IL-8 and LBP were significantly lower in the subset of animals that demonstrated the least clinical response to ligation, indicative of progressing periodontal disease. PGE(2), macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and LBP were decreased in the most diseased subset of animals at delivery. Systemic antibody responses to Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Campylobacter rectus were associated most frequently with variations in inflammatory mediator levels. These results provide a profile of systemic inflammatory mediators during ligature-induced periodontitis in pregnant baboons. The relationship of the oral clinical parameters to systemic inflammatory responses is consistent with a contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subset of the animals.
TI  - Intracellular degradation of Fusobacterium nucleatum in human gingival epithelial cells.
AB  - The role of Fusobacterium nucleatum in oral health and disease is controversial.  We have previously shown that F. nucleatum invades gingival epithelial cells. However, the destiny of the internalized F. nucleatum is not clear. In the present study, the intracellular destiny of F. nucleatum and its cytopathic effect on gingival epithelial cells were studied. The ability of F. nucleatum and seven other oral bacterial species to invade immortalized human gingival epithelial (HOK-16B) cells were compared by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. F. nucleatum had the highest invasive capacity, comparable to that of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. Confocal microscopic examination revealed colocalization of internalized F. nucleatum with endosomes and lysosomes. Examination by transmission electron microscopy revealed that most intracellular F. nucleatum was located within vesicular structures with single enclosed membranes. Furthermore, F. nucleatum could not survive within gingival epithelial cells and had no cytopathic effects on host cells. Interestingly, endosomal maturation played a role in induction of the antimicrobial peptides human beta defensin (HBD)-2 and -3 by F. nucleatum from gingival epithelial cells. F. nucleatum is destined to enter an endocytic degradation pathway after invasion and has no cytopathic effect on gingival epithelial cells, which may cast new light on the role of F. nucleatum in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
TI  - Early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  - AIM: To compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (ZrO(2)) and titanium (Ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. The implants were fitted with either a ZrO(2) or a Ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right randomization). Sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. Wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the ZrO(2) and Ti abutments, at the two observation time points. RESULTS: ZrO(2) and Ti abutments harboured similar counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. Healthy clinical conditions were seen around both ZrO(2) and Ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. Mean probing depths around Ti abutments were slightly deeper than around ZrO(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 SD 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 SD 0.7 mm, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: No difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to ZrO(2) and Ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around ZrO(2) abutments after 3 month.
TI  - Photoinactivation of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis using the ruthenium-based RD3 sensitizer and a conventional halogen lamp.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative method to suppress oral pathogens by the activation of a photosensitizer with laser light. The aim of this study was to investigate the phototoxic effect of three ruthenium-based photosensitizers on Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. METHODS: In this in vitro study F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis were incubated with three photosensitizers: (i) a hydrophobic tris-(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)-ruthenium(II)-dication (RD3), (ii) a hydrophilic tris-[(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diyl)-bis-(benzenesulfonato)]-ruthenate tetra-anion (RSD3) and (iii) a lower hydrophilic tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)-ruthenium(II) dication (RBY). The subsequent irradiation was done with blue-band halogen light (450-485nm) for 20s using a conventional polymerizer. Control samples consisted of bacterial cell suspension irradiated and non-irradiated in the absence of photosensitizer or incubated with the photosensitizer without irradiation. Bacterial inactivation was determined by the numbers of colony-forming units (cfu/ml) after anaerobic cultivation. RESULTS: The RD3 photosensitizer reduced the viability of F. nucleatum by 4-log10 and of P. gingivalis completely after irradiation for 20s. The viability loss correlated significantly with the concentration of the RD3 photosensitizer and reached a peak at a concentration of 12.5muM (p<0.05). The RSD3 and RBY photosensitizers had distinctly lower phototoxic effects in comparison to RD3. CONCLUSION: The RD3 photosensitizer showed a phototoxic effect on F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. The results suggest that the application of the RD3 photosensitizer under visible light may be helpful as an adjunct treatment approach to the inactivation of periodontopathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. The involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. This study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. The setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. Furthermore, it is easy to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. METHODS: Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, S. mutans as main carriogenic species, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, S. intermedius and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. Different liquid growth media were evaluated. Safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. Viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. FINDINGS: S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and P. micra failed to form biofilm structures. S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. intermedius and S. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in CDM/sucrose. A. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. For in depth analysis S. mitis, S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. Microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. Investigation of two species combinations of S. mitis with either S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: This setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. Our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted S. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.
TI  - Murine fetoplacental infection models.
AB  
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. METHODS: Roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. Teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with standardized suspensions of Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. Teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed for 3 minutes with 15 mL of irrigant. Biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. Numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined via the standard spiral-plating methodology. Treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis procedure. Pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney procedure. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the Holm method with p < 0.05. RESULTS: Results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. Levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the NaOCl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) group for S. sanguinis, A. viscosus, and P. nigrescens. Results for F. nucleatum and P. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. It should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.
TI  - Effect of biofilm on the repair bond strengths of composites.
AB  - Composite restorations degrade during wear, but it is unknown how wear affects the composite surface and influences composite-to-composite bonding in minimally invasive repair. Here, it is hypothesized that in vitro exposure of composites to oral biofilm yields clinically relevant degradation of composite surfaces, and its influence on composite-to-composite bonding is determined. Biofilms on composite surfaces in vitro increased their roughness and decreased filler particle exposure, except for a microhybrid composite, similar to effects of clinical wear in palatal appliances. Failure shear stresses after intermediate-adhesive-resin application were significantly lower after aging by in vitro exposure to biofilms, while silica-coating maintained the same failure stress levels as in non-aged composites. Failure modes were predominantly cohesive after silica-coating, while intermediate-adhesive-resin application yielded more adhesive failure. It is concluded that in vitro exposure to oral biofilm is a clinically relevant aging condition, and that silica-coating is to be preferred for the repair of aged composites.
TI  - [Effect of compound Chinese traditional medicine on infected root canal bacteria  biofilm].
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of compound Chinese traditional medicine(CTM), which composed of gallic acid, magnolol and polysaccharide of Blettila striata, against the infected root canal bacterial biofilm. METHODS: Actinomyces viscosus (Av), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) were composed to form biofilm, then confocal laser scan microscope (CLSM) was used to observe and study the bacterial activity. SAS6.12 software package was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The biofilm thickness reduced after treatment by both CTM and ZnO (P>0.05),while there was a significant decrease of the percentage of vital bacterias after treatment by CTM (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The compound Chinese traditional medicine is effective on biofilm control, so that it would be an effective disinfecting drug for root canal sealers. Supported by Research Fund of Bureau of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Shanghai Municipality (Grant No.2008L008A).
TI  - Isolation of a novel bacteriophage specific for the periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a periodontal pathogen that has been directly associated with the development and progression of periodontal disease, a widespread pathology that affects the support tissues of the tooth. We isolated a new bacteriophage (FnpPhi02) that specifically infects this bacterium. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the virion is composed of an icosahedral head and a segmented tail. The size of the phage genome was estimated to be approximately 59 kbp of double-stranded DNA. The morphological features and the genetic characteristics suggest that FnpPhi02 is part of the Siphoviridae family. Using one-step growth and adsorption experiments, the latent period, burst size, and adsorption rate were estimated to be 15 h, 100 infectious units per cell, and 7.5 x 10(-)(1)(0) ml min(-)(1), respectively. A small fragment of phage DNA was cloned and sequenced, showing 93% nucleotide identity with the phage PA6 of Propionibacterium acnes and amino acid identity with fragments of two proteins (Gp3 and Gp4) of this phage. To our knowledge, FnpPhi02 is the first phage described to infect Fusobacterium nucleatum and provides the base for future exploration of phages in the control of periodontal disease.
TI  - Apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. Detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. This study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. METHODS: Seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). Root fragments were cryogenically ground, and DNA was extracted from samples. After multiple displacement amplification, DNA from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all samples. The most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system were Olsenella uli (76.5%), Prevotella baroniae (71%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and Tannerella forsythia (47%). O. uli, P. endodontalis, and Propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. P. baroniae, T. forsythia, and F. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared with matched coronal segments. Streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. The median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. The apical microbiota was usually complex and differed in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against Streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against Streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. The results showed that although Enterocuccus faecium OB7084 and Klebsiella pneumoniae OB7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532(T) , Streptococcus mutans JCM5705(T) and Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) were susceptible. Furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) was not influenced by pH in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline pH. When Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. However, addition of MgCl(2) or CaCl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although ZnCl(2) or MnCl(2) did not influence. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of pH, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum-associated beta-defensin inducer (FAD-I): identification, isolation, and functional evaluation.
AB  - Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides, secreted  by mucosal epithelial cells that regulate adaptive immune functions. We previously reported that Fusobacterium nucleatum, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium of the human oral cavity, induces human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) upon contact with primary oral epithelial cells. We now report the isolation and characterization of an F. nucleatum (ATCC 25586)-associated defensin inducer (FAD-I). Biochemical approaches revealed a cell wall fraction containing four proteins that stimulated the production of hBD2 in human oral epithelial cells (HOECs). Cross-referencing of the N-terminal sequences of these proteins with the F. nucleatum genome revealed that the genes encoding the proteins were FadA, FN1527, FN1529, and FN1792. Quantitative PCR of HOEC monolayers challenged with Escherichia coli clones expressing the respective cell wall proteins revealed that FN1527 was most active in the induction of hBD2 and hence was termed FAD-I. We tagged FN1527 with a c-myc epitope on the C-terminal end to identify and purify it from the E. coli clone. Purified FN1527 (FAD-I) induced hBD2 mRNA and protein expression in HOEC monolayers. F. nucleatum cell wall and FAD-I induced hBD2 via TLR2. Porphorymonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen that does not induce hBD2 in HOECs, was able to significantly induce expression of hBD2 in HOECs only when transformed to express FAD-I. FAD-I or its derivates offer a potentially new paradigm in immunoregulatory therapeutics because they may one day be used to bolster the innate defenses of vulnerable mucosae.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum binding to complement regulatory protein CD46 modulates the expression and secretion of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases by oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that results in the destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Gingival epithelial cells are an important mechanical barrier and participate in the host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. The aim of the present study is to investigate the capacity of Fusobacterium nucleatum to bind to the complement regulatory protein CD46 expressed by oral epithelial cells and to determine the impact of the binding on the gene expression and protein secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by oral epithelial cells. METHODS: Binding of recombinant human CD46 to the surface of F. nucleatum was demonstrated by immunologic assays. After stimulation of oral epithelial cells with F. nucleatum, gene expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis while protein secretion was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Heat and protease treatments of bacterial cells reduced CD46 binding. F. nucleatum-bound CD46 mediated the cleavage of C3b in the presence of factor I. Stimulating oral epithelial cells with F. nucleatum at a multiplicity of infection of 50 resulted in a significant upregulation of the gene expression and protein secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-9 by oral epithelial cells. However, pretreating the epithelial cells with an anti-CD46 polyclonal antibody attenuated the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-9 in response to F. nucleatum. Such an inhibitory effect was not observed with non-specific antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that F. nucleatum can bind the complement regulatory protein CD46. The interaction of F. nucleatum with epithelial cell surface CD46 may contribute to increasing the levels of proinflammatory mediators and MMPs in periodontal sites and consequently modulate tissue destruction.
TI  - A 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  - AIM: Supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. This study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (GI) on dental implants and peri-implant tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. At baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, GI and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: Subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). There were significantly fewer Gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Solobacterium moorei, and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: Twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and GI.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane proteins Fap2 and RadD induce cell death in human lymphocytes.
AB  - Bacterially induced cell death in human lymphocytes is an important virulence factor for pathogenic bacteria. Previously discovered mechanisms of bacterially induced cell death are predominantly based on the transfer of bacterial proteins to the target host cell, such as the toxins secreted through type I, II, and VI secretion systems or effector proteins injected through type III, IV, and Vb secretion systems. Here, we report a mechanism employed by the Gram-negative oral pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum for cell death induction of human lymphocytes via two outer membrane proteins (OMPs), Fap2 and RadD, which share regions homologous to autotransporter secretion systems (type Va secretion systems). Genetic and physiological studies established that inactivation of the two OMPs led to significantly reduced ability to trigger cell death in Jurkat cells, while the corresponding double mutant was almost completely attenuated. Additional biochemical and molecular analyses demonstrated that cell-free F. nucleatum membranes are sufficient to induce cell death in Jurkat cells, suggesting that no active process or effector protein transfer was necessary to induce eukaryotic cell death.
TI  - Potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  - Effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. Sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. This was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. Ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy output of 0.4 mJ/mm(2) at 3 Hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. Calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. In a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. They were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (N = 6/group) using identical settings. Biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. Limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (P </= 0.0001). However, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (P </= 0.0001). The extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. Only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. Within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. To increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. This novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.
TI  - Polybacterial challenge effects on cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the polymicrobial infection of periodontal disease, which elicits inflammatory mediators/cytokines/chemokines in the local gingival tissues, and a polybacterial challenge of antigen-presenting cells, e.g. macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), at the mucosal surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytokine/chemokine profiles of human macrophages and DCs in response to polybacterial challenges were investigated. RESULTS: Oral Gram-negative bacteria elicited significantly greater IL-8 levels from macrophages, compared to Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria did not show synergism in inducing this chemokine from macrophages. In contrast, pairs of oral Gram-negative bacteria elicited synergistic production of IL-8 by macrophages. Similar results were not observed with TNFalpha, which only appeared additive with the polybacterial challenge. Selected Gram-negative bacterial pairs synergized in IL-6 production by immature DCs. In mature DCs (mDCs), a Porphyromonas gingivalis/Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas intermedia/F. nucleatum polybacterial challenge resulted in significant synergism for IL-6 and TNFalpha levels. However, only the Pi/Fn combination synergized for IL-12 production and there appeared to be no polybacterial effect on IL-10 production by the mDCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a polybacterial challenge of cells linking innate and adaptive immune responses results in varied response profiles that are dependent upon the characteristics of the microorganisms that are components of the polybacterial complex.
TI  - A brain abscess following dental extractions in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
AB  - Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must be aware of the potentially life-threatening complications of dental extractions in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia because of their high prevalence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. Despite the lack of evidence-based guidelines, antibiotic cover should be given to patients with HHT who require oral surgery according to the same rules as those used for patients at high risk of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Vaccination of mice with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum modulates the inflammatory response, but fails to prevent experimental periodontitis.
AB  - AIM: To assess the potential of using vaccination with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum, in modulating local subcutaneous inflammatory response and alveolar bone loss following coinfection with both bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were immunized against either P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. The cytokine response to mixed infection with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum was evaluated using the subcutaneous chamber model. The alveolar bone loss induced by oral mixed infection was evaluated by micro-CT using the experimental periodontitis model. Serum levels of specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Vaccination with either bacterium produced a specific humoral response before infection. Animals immunized against either bacteria following a mixed infection with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, showed decreased TNFalpha (but not IL-1beta) levels as compared with non-immunized animals. However, the vaccination did not change the level of mixed infection-induced alveolar bone loss when compared with non-immunized animals. Six weeks following the oral mixed infection, specific antibody titres remained high. Furthermore, specific antibodies against the non-immunized bacterium were present at high levels. CONCLUSIONS: While vaccination produced specific antibodies and suppressed the inflammatory response, it failed to prevent or reduce the progression of experimental periodontitis induced by mixed infection with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Energy dose parameters affect antimicrobial photodynamic therapy-mediated eradication of periopathogenic biofilm and planktonic cultures.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of a commercially available aPDT system in eradication of the periopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. BACKGROUND DATA: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is an effective antibacterial approach in vitro; however, few data are available regarding effective light-energy parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Planktonic and biofilm cultures of periopathogens were exposed to a methylene blue-based formulation and irradiated with a 670-nm nonthermal diode laser. Energy doses were varied from 2.3 to 9.4 J/cm(2) through adjustments in illumination time and a constant power density. Controls consisted of no treatment, light only, and photosensitizer only. Temperature changes were recorded in experimental samples before and after illumination. RESULTS: aPDT with an energy dose of 9.4 J/cm(2) was effective in eradicating P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans in biofilm and planktonic form. Reductions from control in planktonic cultures at this energy dose were 6.8 +/- 0.7, 5.2 +/- 0.6, and 1.9 +/- 0.6 log(10), respectively, whereas biofilm reductions were 4.5 +/- 1.2, 3.4 +/- 1.1, and 4.9 +/- 1.4 log(10). Decreasing the treatment time produced an energy dose-dependent killing effect in both models. Changes in sample temperature did not exceed 3 degrees C under these exposure parameters. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that three important periopathogens are susceptible to aPDT-mediated killing, regardless of whether they are present in planktonic or biofilm form. Furthermore, a clear energy dose-dependence exists with this treatment that should to be taken into account when determining optimal treatment times in clinical application.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum regulation of neutrophil transcription.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Abnormal neutrophil responses have been observed in periodontitis patients, including hyper-reactivity in terms of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following exposure to the key quorum-sensing plaque bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum. This study was designed to characterize the transcriptional response of neutrophils to F. nucleatum. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to F. nucleatum, and gene expression was analysed using high-throughput transcriptomics. RESULTS: Microarray technology demonstrated differential expression of 208 genes (163 increased and 43 decreased relative to control genes), which identified regulation of several ontological classes, including signal transduction (13%), transcription regulation (7%) and ROS response (14%). Individual gene expression analysis of selected transcripts, including CSF, CXCL3, FOS, HMOX1, HSP40, SOD2, NFKB2 and GP91, in individual and pooled RNA samples from control and F. nucleatum-exposed neutrophils corroborated microarray data. Analysis of ROS generation, combined with transcript analysis, in response to a panel of proinflammatory stimuli (F. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and opsonized Staphylococcus aureus) identified significant differences in ROS and transcript regulatory control. Further analyses of neutrophils from periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy control subjects stimulated with F. nucleatum indicated significant differential induction of several ROS response-related transcripts. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that neutrophils are transcriptionally active in response to the periodontal pathogen F. nucleatum and that these changes in gene expression are likely to affect neutrophil function. The differential response of neutrophils to a range of stimuli combined with data demonstrating differences between patient and control neutrophils indicate the importance of this cell and its interaction with the local tissue environment in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
TI  - Microbiota around teeth and dental implants in periodontally healthy, partially edentulous patients: is pre-implant microbiological testing relevant?
AB  - This study aimed to assess the prevalence of seven periodontal marker pathogens,  before implant placement and 1 yr after loading, in periodontally healthy individuals and to assess the long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of pathogens to below threshold levels. In 93 individuals needing single tooth replacement, pooled subgingival microbiological samples from standard sites were cultured and analyzed before implant treatment and 1 yr after loading. Threshold levels commonly used in periodontology to predict periodontal breakdown were applied. Subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. At baseline, 49.5% of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above threshold levels. Periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen levels below threshold values in 78.3% of these initially colonized subjects. In all cases Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were reduced to below threshold. At 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above threshold levels in 74.1% of all subjects. It is concluded that in almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. Long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. Thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in periodontally healthy subjects.
TI  - [Invasion of four common periodontal pathogens into vascular endothelial cells in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the adhesive and invasive ability of four common periodontal pathogens, Pg33277, Pi25611, Aa29522 and Fn10953 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). METHODS: The model of infection of HUVEC by periodontal pathogens was established in vitro. The invasive ability of four periodontal pathogens in HUVEC was tested by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and antibiotic protection assays-colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS: All of the four periodontal pathogens were found to adhere to HUVEC by SEM and invaded HUVEC at invasion numbers of (0.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(8), (4.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(6), (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(6) and (5.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(6) CFU/L respectively by antibiotic protection assays-CFU. The invasion efficiencies were (0.400 +/- 0.050)%, (0.021 +/- 0.003)%, (0.008 +/- 0.002)% and (0.025 +/- 0.002)%, respectively. The invasive ability of Pg33277 was significantly greater than those of the other three periodontal pathogens (P < 0.001). There was no difference in invasive abilities among Pi25611, Aa29522 and Fn10953 (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: All of the four common periodontal pathogens, Pg33277, Pi25611, Aa29522 and Fn10953 could adhere to and invaded HUVEC, with Pg33277 being the strongest.
TI  - Examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs further investigation. Therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria DNA in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria DNA in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. Nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. All patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. After clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. The polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens Tannerella forshytia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens and Treponema denticola. Neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. The selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. A high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of bacterial colonies.
TI  - New aspects and new concepts of maintaining "microbiological" health.
AB  - The human mouth is host to a diverse collection of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Recent advances using molecular methods for the analysis of complex bacterial communities have demonstrated the richness of the oral bacterial biota and the presence of numerous previously undescribed lineages. Dental plaque forms in a structured way with pioneer species able to colonise pellicle-coated enamel followed by secondary plaque formers such as Fusobacterium nucleatum that have the capability of coaggregating with a range of other genera and species. The mature plaque biofilm has many features of multicellular organisms with the constituent organisms cooperating to make nutrients available and resist environmental stresses, and communicating to regulate their overall numbers. Control of the oral microbiota to prevent disease has conventionally been by mechanical means augmented with toothpastes and mouthrinses, but improved knowledge of oral microbial ecology is allowing the development of pre and pro-biotic approaches. Other possibilities include interference with the plaque formation process and the perturbation of bacterial communication networks.
TI  - A multiple choice answer?
AB  
TI  - Antiaggregation potential of berry fractions against pairs of Streptococcus mutans with Fusobacterium nucleatum or Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - Coaggregation is an interspecies adhesion process, which is essential to the development of dental plaque. This is an in vitro study of the composition of the soluble solids in the berry juice molecular size fractions (<10 kDa, FI; 10-100 kDa, FII; >100 kDa, FIII) derived from apple, bilberry, blackcurrant, cloudberry, crowberry and lingonberry and their ability to inhibit and reverse coaggregation of the pairs of common species in dental plaque: Streptococcus mutans with Fusobacterium nucleatum or Actinomyces naeslundii. Inhibitory and reversal activity was found in the molecular size fractions FII and FIII of bilberry, blackcurrant, crowberry and lingonberry. The active fractions contained higher amounts of polyphenols (5-12% of soluble solids) than those without activity (<2% of soluble solids). Proanthocyanidins dominated in the active lingonberry juice fractions FII and FIII and also small amounts of anthocyanins were detected. Anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonol glycosides were prevalent in FII and FIII fractions of bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices. Comparable amounts of sugars and titratable acids were present in the latter three berry juice fractions of different size. The results indicate that the high molecular size fractions of lingonberry, bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices have antiaggregation potential on common oral bacteria, the potential being associated with their polyphenolic content.
TI  - Differential and coordinated expression of defensins and cytokines by gingival epithelial cells and dendritic cells in response to oral bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) both initiate and contribute to innate immune responses to bacteria. However, much less is known about the coordinated regulation of innate immune responses between GECs and immune cells, particularly DCs in the oral cavity. The present study was conducted to investigate whether their responses are coordinated and are bacteria-specific in the oral cavity. RESULTS: The beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides hBD1, hBD2 and hBD3 were expressed by immature DCs as well as gingival epithelial cells (GECs). HBD1, hBD2 and hBD3 are upregulated in DCs while hBD2 and hBD3 are upregulated in GECs in response to bacterial stimulation. Responses of both cell types were bacteria-specific, as demonstrated by distinctive profiles of hBDs mRNA expression and secreted cytokines and chemokines in response to cell wall preparations of various bacteria of different pathogenicity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The regulation of expression of hBD2, IL-8, CXCL2/GRObeta and CCL-20/MIP3alpha by GECs was greatly enhanced by conditioned medium from bacterially activated DCs. This enhancement was primarily mediated via IL-1beta, since induction was largely attenuated by IL-1 receptor antagonist. In addition, the defensins influence DCs by eliciting differential cytokine and chemokine secretion. HBD2 significantly induced IL-6, while hBD3 induced MCP-1 to approximately the same extent as LPS, suggesting a unique role in immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cytokines, chemokines and beta-defensins are involved in interaction of these two cell types, and the responses are bacteria-specific. Differential and coordinated regulation between GECs and DCs may be important in regulation of innate immune homeostasis and response to pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - HIV-1 reactivation induced by the periodontal pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis involves Toll-like receptor 2 [corrected] and 9 activation in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  - Although oral coinfections (e.g., periodontal disease) are highly prevalent in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (HIV-1(+)) patients and appear to positively correlate with viral load levels, the potential for oral bacteria to induce HIV-1 reactivation in latently infected cells has received little attention. We showed that HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activation can be induced by periodontopathogens in monocytes/macrophages; nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in this response remain undetermined. Since Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, and TLR9 activation have been involved in HIV-1 recrudescence, we sought to determine the role of these TLRs in HIV-1 reactivation induced by the periodontal pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis using BF24 monocytes/macrophages stably transfected with the HIV-1 promoter driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression and THP89GFP cells, a model of HIV-1 latency. We demonstrated that TLR9 activation by F. nucleatum and TLR2 activation by both bacteria appear to be involved in HIV-1 reactivation; however, TLR4 activation had no effect. Moreover, the autocrine activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) but not interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) produced in response to bacteria could impact viral reactivation. The transcription factors NF-kappaB and Sp1 appear to be positively regulating HIV-1 reactivation induced by these oral pathogens. These results suggest that oral Gram-negative bacteria (F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis) associated with oral and systemic chronic inflammatory disorders enhance HIV-1 reactivation in monocytes/macrophages through TLR2 and TLR9 activation in a mechanism that appears to be transcriptionally regulated. Increased bacterial growth and emergence of these bacteria or their products accompanying chronic oral inflammatory diseases could be risk modifiers for viral replication, systemic immune activation, and AIDS progression in HIV-1(+) patients.
TI  - [Usefulness and limit of Gram staining smear examination].
AB  - Gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. It yields results much faster than culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. However, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by Gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. Therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from Gram staining smears is also present. The Gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. Species of Gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. Gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. Even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive diplococcus, forming Gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling Streptococcus pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in the sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Capnocytophaga sp. is a Gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - [Identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  - Routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. This study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. One hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during March 20-October 30 2007, were included in the study. The specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to Wilkins Chalgren agar, Schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. Isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with API 20A panels (Bio-Merieux, France) via conventional methods and by the help of AN-IDENT Discs (Oxoid, England). Penicillin G, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with E- test method. Twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 Escherichia coli and 4 Enterococcus spp.) growth. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. The distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), Bacteroides spp. other than B.fragilis (n = 4), Clostridium spp. (n = 2), Fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), Prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), Peptococcus niger (n = 2), Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and Lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). Beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 B. fragilis isolates. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. The highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin G (9/22; 41%). While anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. Among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. The results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at Konya area in Turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of subgingival species in chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The increasing rate of resistance of microorganisms to  penicillin and other antibiotics has generated concern among health authorities in Latin America. The present investigation determined the in vitro susceptibility of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, black-pigmented Prevotella spp. and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin in patients with chronic periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and nonselective culture media. The antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathogenic isolates was studied in chronic periodontitis patients in Colombia. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were tested on all bacterial isolates and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. RESULTS: Of the 150 bacteria identified, 51 were P. gingivalis, 45 were black-pigmented Prevotella spp., 36 were F. nucleatum and 18 were A. actinomycetemcomitans. All the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and to moxifloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to the other antimicrobial agents tested. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that periodontal microorganisms in patients with chronic periodontitis can be resistant to the antimicrobial agents commonly used in anti-infective periodontal therapy. We suggest that the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials could result in the appearance of more highly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria associated with periodontal diseases in our population compared with the populations of other countries.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of n-6, n-7 and n-9 fatty acids and their esters for oral  microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to assess the antibacterial activity of omega-6, -7, -9  (n-6, n-7, n-9) fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids, such as gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), palmitoleic acid (PA), and oleic acid (OA), their fatty acid ethyl esters, GLA-EE, LA-EE, ARA-EE, PA-EE, OA-EE, and their fatty acid methyl esters, GLA-ME, LA-ME, ARA-ME, PA-ME, OA-ME, were investigated for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Various concentrations of the fatty acids, their methyl and ethyl esters were tested against various oral pathogens in 96-well plates and blood-agar plate. The plates were incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 degrees C for 48h, and the colony forming units (CFU) were determined. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that select n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and their esters exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against these oral microorganisms, demonstrating some specificity for individual microbial species. CONCLUSION: The potential use or the combinations of the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and/or their esters, provided in a local delivery vehicle to infected sites in the oral cavity, could be considered as an additional therapeutic approach to improving oral health.
TI  - Folding of a transcriptionally acting preQ1 riboswitch.
AB  - 7-Aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ(1)) sensitive mRNA domains belong to the smallest riboswitches known to date. Although recent efforts have revealed the three-dimensional architecture of the ligand-aptamer complex less is known about the molecular details of the ligand-induced response mechanism that modulates gene expression. We present an in vitro investigation on the ligand-induced folding process of the preQ(1) responsive RNA element from Fusobacterium nucleatum using biophysical methods, including fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy of site-specifically labeled riboswitch variants. We provide evidence that the full-length riboswitch domain adopts two different coexisting stem-loop structures in the expression platform. Upon addition of preQ(1), the equilibrium of the competing hairpins is significantly shifted. This system therefore, represents a finely tunable antiterminator/terminator interplay that impacts the in vivo cellular response mechanism. A model is presented how a riboswitch that provides no obvious overlap between aptamer and terminator stem-loop solves this communication problem by involving bistable sequence determinants.
TI  - Gram-negative periodontal bacteria induce the activation of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and cytokine production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a bacterially induced chronic inflammatory disease.  Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which could recognize microbial pathogens, are important components in the innate and adaptive immune systems. Both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses might result from different bacteria stimulation and the triggering of different TLRs. This study explores the interaction of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) with TLR2 and TLR4. METHODS: We studied the gene expression changes of TLR2 and TLR4 and cytokine production (interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, -10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLCs) stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies to TLR2 or TLR4 (anti-TLR2/4 mAb). RESULTS: Both test bacteria and 10 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS treatment increased the gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4 and cytokine production in HPDLCs. In addition, these upregulations could be blocked by anti-TLR2/4 mAb. However, the expression of TLR4 mRNA in HPDLCs stimulated with 1 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS was not increased. No differences were found in the cytokine production caused by 1 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS treatment in the presence or absence of anti-TLR4 mAb. CONCLUSION: These patterns of gene expression and cytokine production indicate that Gram-negative periodontal bacteria or their LPS might play a role in triggering TLR2 and/or TLR4, and be of importance for the immune responses in periodontitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of 3 oral antiseptics containing octenidine, polyhexamethylene biguanide, or Citroxx: can chlorhexidine be replaced?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of oral antiseptics decreases the bacterial load in the oral cavity. OBJECTIVE: To compare the antimicrobial activity of 3 novel oral antiseptics with that of chlorhexidine, which is considered the "gold standard" of oral hygiene. DESIGN: Comparative in vitro study. METHODS: Four common oral microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were tested under standard conditions and at different concentrations, by use of a broth dilution assay and an agar diffusion assay and by calculating the log10 reduction factor (RF). The antimicrobial activity of each antiseptic was assessed by counting the difference in bacterial densities (ie, the log10 number of colony-forming units of bacteria) before and after the disinfection process. RESULTS: The oral antiseptics containing octenidine (with an RF in the range of 7.1-8.24 CFU/mL) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (with an RF in the range of 7.1-8.24 CFU/mL) demonstrated antimicrobial activity comparable to that of chlorhexidine (with an RF in the range of 1.03-8.24 CFU/mL), whereas the mouth rinse containing Citroxx (Citroxx Biosciences; with an RF in the range of 0.22-1.36 CFU/mL) showed significantly weaker antimicrobial efficacy. Overall, octenidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide were more active at lower concentrations.conclusion. Oral antiseptics containing the antimicrobial agent octenidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide may be considered as potent alternatives to chlorhexidine-based preparations.
TI  - Effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  - We report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. Fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (H(2)S >1.5 or CH(3)SH >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. Either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. Mouth air was monitored for VSC levels at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. Whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. At 10 min, the level of CH(3)SH was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; P = 0.011). The median concentration of CH(3)SH in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2 h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. No difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative PCR, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; P = 0.033). These results indicate a suppressive effect of the test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - The recolonization hypothesis in a full-mouth or multiple-session treatment protocol: a blinded, randomized clinical trial.
AB  - AIM: To test recolonization of periodontal lesions after full-mouth scaling and root planing (FM-SRP) or multiple session-SRP (MS-SRP) in a randomized clinical trial and whether FM-SRP and MS-SRP result in different clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to FM-SRP or MS-SRP groups. At baseline and after 3 months, probing pocket depth (PPD), plaque index (PlI) and bleeding on probing (BoP) were recorded. At baseline, immediately after treatment, after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 90 days, paper point samples from a single site from the maxillary right quadrant were collected for microbiological analysis of five putative pathogens by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: FM-SRP and MS-SRP resulted in significant reductions in PPD, BoP and PlI and the overall detection frequencies of the five species after 3 months without significant differences between treatments. Compared with MS-SRP, FM-SRP resulted in less recolonization of the five species, significantly for Treponema denticola, in the tested sites. CONCLUSION: FM-SRP and MS-SRP result in overall clinically and microbiologically comparable outcomes where recolonization of periodontal lesions may be better prevented by FM-SRP.
TI  - In vitro cytokine responses to periodontal pathogens: generalized aggressive periodontitis is associated with increased IL-6 response to Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) is an inflammatory condition resulting in destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. We examined the production of IL-1beta, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-12 and IL-10 in cultures of peripheral mononuclear cells (MNC) from 10 patients with GAgP and 10 controls stimulated with periodontal pathogens or a control antigen, tetanus toxoid (TT) in the presence of autologous serum. The pathogens used were Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, either as type strains or bacteria isolated from the participants' inherent oral flora. The P. gingivalis -induced production of IL-6 was approximately 2.5-fold higher in patients with GAgP than in healthy controls (P < 0.05), while the corresponding TNF-alpha production was non-significantly elevated. IL-1beta production induced by P. gingivalis, as all cytokine responses induced by Pr. intermedia, F. nucleatum and TT was similar in the two groups. A reduced IL-12p70 response to Pr. intermedia and F. nucleatum was observed in smokers compared to non-smoking patients (P < 0.02). To assess the role of serum factors in the elevated IL-6 response to P. gingivalis, MNC from two donors free of disease were stimulated with this bacterium in the presence of the various patient and control sera. An elevated IL-6 and TNF-alpha response was observed in the presence of patient sera (P < 0.01 and P < 0.04, respectively). The data suggest that an exaggerated production of IL-6 occurs in GAgP, and that pro-inflammatory serum factors play an essential role in the response.
TI  - Identification of immunological parameters associated with the alveolar bone level in periodontal patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: The present study was performed to clarify the relationship between periodontal disease severity and selected immunological parameters consisting of serum IgG titer against periodontopathogenic bacteria, the expression of the helper T-cell cytokine by gingival mononuclear cells, and patients' immunoreactivity to cross-reactive heat shock protein (HSP) epitope peptide from P. gingivalis HSP60. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with moderate periodontitis had their gingival connective tissue harvested of gingival mononuclear cells during an open flap debridement procedure and peripheral blood was drawn by venipuncture to collect serum. The mean level of interproximal alveolar bone was calculated to be used as an index for periodontal disease severity for a given patient. Each of selected immunologic parameters was subject to statistical management to seek their correlations with the severity of periodontal disease. RESULTS: A significant correlation could not be identified between serum IgG titers against specific bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Streptococcus mutans) and the severity of periodontal disease. Expression of interleukin (IL)-10 by gingival mononuclear cells was statistically significant in the group of patients who had higher levels of alveolar bone height. However, a similar correlation could not be demonstrated in cases for IL-4 or interferon-gamma. Patients' serum reactivity to cross-reactive epitope peptide showed a significant correlation with the amount of alveolar bone. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that expression of IL-10 by gingival mononuclear cells and patients' sero-reactivity to the cross-reactive HSP peptide of P. gingivalis HSP60 were significantly correlated with alveolar bone height.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Production of indole from L-tryptophan and effects of these compounds on biofilm  formation by Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586.
AB  - The l-tryptophan degradation product indole is a purported extracellular signaling molecule that influences biofilm formation in various bacteria. Here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in Fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on F. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 was 28% identical to that deduced from tnaA in Escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the beta-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole. The fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnaB encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. The transcript started at position -68 or -153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that much more F. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase cells. Indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The K(m) and k(cat) of the enzyme were 0.26 +/- 0.03 mM and 0.74 +/- 0.04 s(-1), respectively. F. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. Exogenous indole also increased F. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. Thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase F. nucleatum biofilms.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of MDPB against anaerobes associated with endodontic infections.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the antibacterial effects of 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB), an antibacterial monomer synthesized by combining quaternary ammonium with a methacryloyl group, against three anaerobes associated with endodontic infections using planktonic and biofilm cells. METHODOLOGY: The antibacterial activity of unpolymerized MDPB against Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella nigrescens was examined by agar-disc diffusion tests and determination of the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC). Rapid killing effects of MDPB against three bacteria in planktonic form were examined by a cell number counting method, and those against biofilm cells were assessed by a viability staining method. RESULTS: MDPB demonstrated inhibition against all of the bacteria tested by agar-disc diffusion tests. The MIC/MBC values of MDPB for the three anaerobes were much smaller than those of other resin monomers, although greater compared with those of cetylpyridinium chloride or chlorhexidine diacetate for E. faecalis and F. nucleatum. Significant reduction in viable planktonic cells was obtained by contact with 250 microg mL(-1) of MDPB for 20 s (P < 0.05, Fisher's PLSD tests), and 40 s contact with 500 microg mL(-1) or 20 s contact with 1000 microg mL(-1) of MDPB resulted in more than 90% killing. Biofilm cells of all species were completely killed by application of 1000 microg mL(-1) of MDPB for 60 s. CONCLUSION: MDPB was found to have strong antibacterial effects against E. faecalis, F. nucleatum and P. nigrescens, and such effects were rapidly exhibited even against biofilm cells, suggesting the usefulness of application of MDPB to resin-based materials for root canal filling.
TI  - Communication: Antimicrobial Activity of SMAP28 with a Targeting Domain for Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. However, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. A 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. One such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached PQGPPQ, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the N-terminus of SMAP28 (peptide ZS37-37) or the C-terminus of SMAP28 (peptide ZS37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver SMAP28 to the surface of P. gingivalis. For Escherichia coli and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ZS37-37 was higher than the median of SMAP28 alone, although the median MIC of ZS37-38 was lower than that of SMAP28 alone. For P. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median MIC values. For S. aureus, the median MIC was higher for ZS37-37 and ZS37-38 compared to SMAP28 alone, particularly for ZS37-38. For Fusobacterium nucleatum, the median MIC values were equal for ZS37-37 and ZS37-38 and higher than the median MIC for SMAP28 alone. Attaching PQGPPQ to SMAP28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of ZS37-37 or ZS37-38 for P. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of ZS37-37 or ZS37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. This is an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua. STUDY DESIGN: The immunostimulatory effects of Gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with Escherichia coli. Cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. Lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. Of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. CONCLUSION: The ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. This adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.
TI  - Term stillbirth caused by oral Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine infection is a recognized cause of adverse pregnancy outcome, but the source of infection is often undetermined. We report a case of stillbirth caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum that originated in the mother's mouth. CASE: A woman with pregnancy-associated gingivitis experienced an upper respiratory tract infection at term, followed by stillbirth a few days later. F. nucleatum was isolated from the placenta and the fetus. Examination of different microbial floras from the mother identified the same clone in her subgingival plaque but not in the supragingival plaque, vagina, or rectum. CONCLUSION: F. nucleatum may have translocated from the mother's mouth to the uterus when the immune system was weakened during the respiratory infection. This case sheds light on patient management for those with pregnancy-associated gingivitis.
TI  - Production of hydrogen sulfide by two enzymes associated with biosynthesis of homocysteine and lanthionine in Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum produces a large amount of the toxic metabolite hydrogen  sulfide in the oral cavity. Here, we report the molecular basis of F. nucleatum H(2)S production, which is associated with two different enzymes: the previously reported Cdl (Fn1220) and the newly identified Lcd (Fn0625). SDS-PAGE analysis with activity staining revealed that crude enzyme extracts from F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 contained three major H(2)S-producing proteins. Two of the proteins with low molecular masses migrated similarly to purified Fn0625 and Fn1220. Their kinetic values suggested that Fn0625 had a lower enzymic capacity to produce H(2)S from L-cysteine (approximately 30%) than Fn1220. The Fn0625 protein degraded a variety of substrates containing betaC-S linkages to produce ammonia, pyruvate and sulfur-containing products. Unlike Fn0625, Fn1220 produced neither pyruvate nor ammonia from L-cysteine. Reversed-phase HPLC separation and mass spectrometry showed that incubation of L-cysteine with Fn1220 produced H(2)S and an uncommon amino acid, lanthionine, which is a natural constituent of the peptidoglycans of F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. In contrast, most of the sulfur-containing substrates tested, except L-cysteine, were not used by Fn1220. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the fn1220 gene showed several-fold higher expression than fn0625 and housekeeping genes in exponential-phase cultures of F. nucleatum. Thus, we conclude that Fn0625 and Fn1220 produce H(2)S in distinct manners: Fn0625 carries out beta-elimination of L-cysteine to produce H(2)S, pyruvate and ammonia, whereas Fn1220 catalyses the beta-replacement of L-cysteine to produce H(2)S and lanthionine, the latter of which may be used for peptidoglycan formation in F. nucleatum.
TI  - [Effect of periodontal mechanical treatment on periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid of chronic periodontitis patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the subgingival prevalent rates of 6 periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluids of CP patients before and after treatment, to analyze the relationship between the prevalent variance and periodontal clinical parameters, and to provide a microbiologic method of evaluating curative effect and estimating the prognosis. METHODS: Gingival crevicular fluids of 13 CP patients were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment. Also, gingival crevicular fluids were collected from 11 healthy subjects. Six periodontal pathogenic bacteria including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis(Pg), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum(Fn), Prevotella nigrescens (Pn) were detected by 16S rRNA based PCR. RESULTS: The PLI, PD, BI of the CP patients 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment were evidently less than those before treatment. These 4 months after treatment were a little more than those 2 months after. The six bacteria were more frequently detected in the CP patients at baseline than in healthy controls. The prevalent rates of Tf (42.1%, 73.7%, 70.2%), Pg (47.4%, 68.4%, 77.2%), Aa (15.8%, 22.8%, 7.0%), Pn (38.6%, 57.9%, 64.9%), Pi(15.8%, 38.6%, 42.1%) 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months following treatment were significantly lower than those at baseline (Tf 96.5%, Pg 93.0%, Aa 36.8%, Pn 86.0%, Pi 84.2%), but the prevalent rates of all the detected bacteria 2 months after treatment were higher than those at 2 weeks after. CONCLUSION: Tf, Pg, Aa, Pn and Pi may cooperate in the development of CP. The changes of periodontal pathogenic bacteria could be detected before the changes of clinical parameters and the patients should be re-evaluated and re-treated regularly within 2 months after treatment.
TI  - Detection of a mixed infection in a culture-negative brain abscess by broad-spectrum bacterial 16S rRNA gene PCR.
AB  - We describe the identification of two bacterial pathogens from a culture-negative brain abscess by the use of broad-spectrum 16S rRNA gene PCR. Simultaneous detection of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas endodontalis was possible due to a 24-bp length difference of their partially amplified 16S rRNA genes, which allowed separation by high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidised water against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The radical anion of oxygen (O(-)) is extremely oxidative and shows high reactivity. In this study, the antibacterial activity of water super-oxidised water containing high concentration of O(-) (O(-)-water) was tested against cultured planktonic cells of cariogenic bacteria, periodontopathic bacteria and Candida albicans. METHODS: O(-)-water was prepared using the AOE-750 (Oxy Japan Corporation, Japan) and its antibacterial activity against pure culture of Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and C. albicans evaluated. Each oral microorganism (10(4) to 10(8)CFU/ml) was exposed to three concentrations of O(-)-water at room temperature or 37 degrees C for 15s to 24h. RESULTS: Exposure to O(-)-water resulted in a bactericidal effect against all cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria tested. No significant fungicidal effect was observed on C. albicans, however. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that O(-)-water exerts an antibacterial effect on cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with KB cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (KB cells). METHODS: KB cells were co-cultured with Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 and M5-1-2, Tannerella forsythia ATCC 43037, Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586 in single and mixed infections. The numbers of adherent and internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. Additionally, the mRNA expression and concentrations of released interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured. RESULTS: All periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to KB cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to F. nucleatum. High levels of epithelial mRNA of IL-6 and IL-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. After the mixed infection of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. No IL-6 and IL-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of P. gingivalis M5-1-2 and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and the fourfold infection of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, T. denticola ATCC 35405, T. forsythia ATCC 43037 and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. CONCLUSION: Anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of IL-6 and IL-8 by epithelial cells. Despite a continuous epithelial expression of IL-8 mRNA by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation of cytokines by bacterial proteases. Mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. Further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  - Biofilm formation enhances the oxygen tolerance and invasiveness of Fusobacterium nucleatum in an oral mucosa culture model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study evaluates the survival capability of Fusobacterium  nucleatum strains in an aerobic environment and compares the invasive capability of F. nucleatum in biofilm and planktonic forms in an organotypic cell culture (OCC) model. METHODS: Biofilms of F. nucleatum American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25586 or Anaerobe Helsinki Negative (AHN) 9508 were produced by culturing on semipermeable membranes on brucella agar plates. The oxygen tolerance of the F. nucleatum strains was examined by incubating 3-day-old anaerobically grown biofilms in an aerobic environment (CO(2) [5% in air] incubator) for an additional 48 hours. The OCC model was constructed by seeding keratinocytes on a fibroblast-containing collagen gel. In invasion assays, a 3-day-old anaerobically grown biofilm (and planktonic bacteria in solution as the control) was placed upside down on the top of OCC and incubated under 5% CO(2) for 24 hours. Invasion of the bacteria and morphologic changes in OCC were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin, Ki-67, and periodic acid-Schiff stainings. RESULTS: In biofilms, both F. nucleatum strains continuously increased their cell numbers in an aerobic environment for 48 hours. After incubating the bacterial biofilm in contact with the OCC model, F. nucleatum AHN 9508 was able to pass through the epithelial/basement membrane barrier and invade the collagen matrix. The invasiveness of biofilm F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 was limited to the epithelium. Cytotoxic effects and invasiveness of F. nucleatum on the OCC were much stronger when the bacteria were in biofilms than in the planktonic form. CONCLUSION: Biofilm formation regulates the survival and invasiveness of F. nucleatum in an aerobic environment.
TI  - Full-mouth antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in Fusobacterium nucleatum-infected periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to clinically and microbiologically evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a full-mouth procedure in Fusobacterium nucleatum-infected patients with periodontitis. METHODS: In the present study, PDT is administered adjuvantly after scaling and root planing (SRP) to patients with localized chronic periodontitis (LCP). Twenty-four patients, in whom only F. nucleatum was detected by baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after SRP, were randomly assigned to PDT and control groups. PDT was carried out once as a full-mouth disinfection in the test group. The control group was treated with the photosensitizer solution, but without laser irradiation. In all subjects, the clinical parameters plaque index, reddening, bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were determined at the baseline examination and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after PDT. Quantitative analysis of the F. nucleatum DNA concentration was performed by competitive PCR. All clinical indices were calculated for each test and control subject as were the median and interquartile range of each group. RESULTS: In patients with LCP who received PDT treatment, significant reductions in reddening, BOP, and mean PD and CAL were observed during the observation period and with respect to controls. Four and 12 weeks after PDT, the mean PD and CAL showed significant differences from baseline values and from those of the control group. In the PDT group, 12 weeks after treatment, the F. nucleatum DNA concentration was found to be significantly reduced compared to the baseline level. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the adjuvant application of the described PDT method is appropriate to reduce periodontal inflammatory symptoms and to successfully treat infection with F. nucleatum.
TI  - Supernatants from oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts modulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter activation induced by periodontopathogens in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  - Bacterial and host cell products during coinfections of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1-positive (HIV-1(+)) patients regulate HIV-1 recrudescence in latently infected cells (e.g. T cells, monocytes/macrophages), impacting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) failure and progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A high frequency of oral opportunistic infections (e.g. periodontitis) in HIV-1(+) patients has been demonstrated; however, their potential to impact HIV-1 exacerbation is unclear. We sought to determine the ability of supernatants derived from oral epithelial cells (OKF4) and human gingival fibroblasts (Gin-4) challenged with periodontal pathogens, to modulate the HIV-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages. BF24 monocytes/macrophages transfected with the HIV-1 promoter driving the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, or Treponema denticola in the presence of supernatants from OKF4 or Gin4 cells either unstimulated or previously pulsed with bacteria. CAT levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytokine production was evaluated by Luminex beadlyte assays. OKF4 and Gin4 supernatants enhanced HIV-1 promoter activation particularly related to F. nucleatum challenge. An additive effect was observed in HIV-1 promoter activation when monocytes/macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with gingival cell supernatants and bacterial extracts. OKF4 cells produced higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukins -6 and -8 in response to F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. Preincubation of OKF4 supernatants with anti-GM-CSF reduced the additive effect in periodontopathogen-induced HIV-1 promoter activation. These results suggest that soluble mediators produced by gingival resident cells in response to periodontopathogens could contribute to HIV-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages, albeit this effect is most notable following direct stimulation of the cells with oral gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. While n-3 PUFA have been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. The n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, ALAEE, EPAEE, DHAEE were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. This study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three major n-3 PUFA, EPA, DHA, and ALA, and their ester derivatives. Our experimental data indicated that n-3 PUFA and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. This study suggested that n-3 PUFA could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.
TI  - Endodontic photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source: an in vitro and ex vivo study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (PAD) using toluidine blue and an LED lamp was tested on endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and after inoculation into extracted teeth. Irradiation time was limited to 30 seconds. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of PAD on planktonic suspensions of Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedius was analyzed using Poisson regression. Moreover, cultures of S. intermedius were inoculated into prepared root canals of extracted molars. The effect of PAD performed immediately after inoculation or after overnight bacterial incubation was determined by a 2-sample t test. RESULTS: Photoactivated disinfection yielded significant reductions (P < .001) in the viable counts of all organisms in planktonic suspension. The PAD treatment of S. intermedius in root canals yielded a mean log10 reduction of 2.60 (P < .001) immediately after inoculation and of 1.38 (P < .001) after overnight incubation. CONCLUSION: Photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source strongly reduces the number of viable endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and in root canals.
TI  - Effect of alkaline growth pH on the expression of cell envelope proteins in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic organism that plays a central role in the development of periodontal diseases. The progression of periodontitis is associated with a rise in pH of the gingival sulcus which promotes the growth and expression of virulence factors by periodontopathic bacteria. We have previously reported that the expression of specific cytoplasmic proteins is altered by a shift in growth pH. In the present study we have compared cell envelope protein expression of F. nucleatum during chemostat growth at pH 7.2 and 7.8. From a total of 176 proteins resolved from the cell envelope, 15 were found to have altered expression in response to an increase in growth pH and were identified by MS. Upregulated proteins included an outer membrane porin which has been identified as playing a role in virulence, a periplasmic chaperone which assists in the folding of outer membrane proteins, and a transporter thought to be involved with iron uptake. Proteins downregulated at pH 7.8 were consistent with our previous findings that the bacterium reduces its catabolism of energy-yielding substrates in favour of energy-storage pathways. Among the downregulated proteins, two transporters which are involved in the uptake of C4 dicarboxylates and phosphate were identified. A putative protease and an enzyme associated with the metabolism of glutamate were also identified. A high proportion of the cell envelope proteins suggested by these data to play a role in the organism's response to alkaline growth pH may have arisen by lateral gene transfer. This would support the hypothesis that genes that provide an ability to adapt to the changing conditions of the oral environment may be readily shared between oral bacteria.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  - In recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used in periodontal therapy. However, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of PDT on the periodontal tissues. This microbiological study examined the effects of PDT on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (SRP) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting PDT or SRP for use in different quadrants of the mouth. For the present study, PDT was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an Nd:YA G laser (1,064 nm). Microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. Significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. The diode laser with SRP presented long-term positive results, while PDT showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of Rosa damascena extract on selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of a plant-derived extract (2 percent Rosa damascena extract) with 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 2 percent chlorhexidine (CHX) on selected endodontic pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2 percent rose extract and 2 percent CHX for test microorganisms, except F. nucleatum, were lower than that of 5.25 percent NaOCl. All solutions were able to kill all test microorganisms after one minute.
TI  - Potentiation of bacterial killing activity of zinc chloride by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate.
AB  - Zinc has antimicrobial activity and zinc salts including zinc chloride (ZnCl(2))  have been used for the control of oral malodor. In this study, we hypothesized that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a zinc ionophore, may enhance antimicrobial efficacy of ZnCl(2). The bactericidal effectiveness of ZnCl(2) alone (0.5-8 mM) or in combination with PDTC (1 or 10 microM) was evaluated by in vitro short (1 h) time-killing assays against Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Only a slight viability decrease was observed with ZnCl(2) or PDTC alone after 1-h incubation. By contrast, combination of ZnCl(2) and PDTC could achieve a more than 100-fold viability reduction compared with ZnCl(2) or PDTC alone in F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. Therefore, PDTC greatly enhanced the bactericidal activity of ZnCl(2) against the oral malodor-producing bacteria. These results suggest that use of PDTC may be useful for enhancing bactericidal activity of antimalodor regimens of zinc salts.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Interplay of protease-activated receptors and NOD pattern recognition receptors in epithelial innate immune responses to bacteria.
AB  - Protease-activated receptors (PARs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a role in innate immunity, but little is known about interaction between these receptors. The goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. Human gingival epithelial cells (GECs) were transfected with siRNA specific for PAR1 or PAR2, then stimulated with periopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen Streptococcus gordonii. PAR1 or PAR2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated NOD1 and NOD2 expression with P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum stimulation (p<0.01), as well as enhanced TLR2 and TLR4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize TLR2 or TLR4, respectively. Involvement of PARs for induction of CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. Furthermore, results from multiple cytokine ELISA array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. Our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters.
TI  - Oral biofilm architecture on natural teeth.
AB  - Periodontitis and caries are infectious diseases of the oral cavity in which oral biofilms play a causative role. Moreover, oral biofilms are widely studied as model systems for bacterial adhesion, biofilm development, and biofilm resistance to antibiotics, due to their widespread presence and accessibility. Despite descriptions of initial plaque formation on the tooth surface, studies on mature plaque and plaque structure below the gum are limited to landmark studies from the 1970s, without appreciating the breadth of microbial diversity in the plaque. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization to localize in vivo the most abundant species from different phyla and species associated with periodontitis on seven embedded teeth obtained from four different subjects. The data showed convincingly the dominance of Actinomyces sp., Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Spirochaetes, and Synergistetes in subgingival plaque. The latter proved to be new with a possibly important role in host-pathogen interaction due to its localization in close proximity to immune cells. The present study identified for the first time in vivo that Lactobacillus sp. are the central cells of bacterial aggregates in subgingival plaque, and that Streptococcus sp. and the yeast Candida albicans form corncob structures in supragingival plaque. Finally, periodontal pathogens colonize already formed biofilms and form microcolonies therein. These in vivo observations on oral biofilms provide a clear vision on biofilm architecture and the spatial distribution of predominant species.
TI  - Quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens in female patients with and without chronic periodontitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Chronic periodontitis is a highly prevalent endogenous polymicrobial disease. To  better understand the etiology of the disease a quantitative approach is mandatory and real-time PCR is the molecular technique currently preferred to achieve this purpose. Taking into account that such a kind of study is still scarce, we aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal microbiota and chronic periodontitis. A total of 60 low-income age-matched female adults, 30 with chronic periodontitis and 30 without periodontal disease, were enrolled. DNA obtained from subgingival specimens was used for quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia by real-time PCR. A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens, and F. nucleatum were detected in all subjects, P. gingivalis was observed in 70.0% and 46.6% and P. intermedia in 90.0% and 80.0% of chronic periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy subjects, respectively. P. gingivalis mean count was significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in periodontally healthy individuals. Accurate detection and quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens was feasible using a simple and fast real-time PCR protocol. Although P. gingivalis and P. intermedia have been found more commonly in chronic periodontitis patients, no statistical difference was observed between periodontally diseased and healthy groups. Quantitative data indicated association between P. gingivalis and chronic periodontitis. However, because of its uneven distribution, it should not be solely taken as a marker of periodontal status.
TI  - Vaccination targeting surface FomA of Fusobacterium nucleatum against bacterial co-aggregation: Implication for treatment of periodontal infection and halitosis.
AB  - The mechanical therapy with multiple doses of antibiotics is one of modalities for treatment of periodontal diseases. However, treatments using multiple doses of antibiotics carry risks of generating resistant strains and misbalancing the resident body flora. We present an approach via immunization targeting an outer membrane protein FomA of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), a central bridging organism in the architecture of oral biofilms. Neutralization of FomA considerably abrogated the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms and production of volatile sulfur compounds mediated by an inter-species interaction of F. nucleatum with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Vaccination targeting FomA also conferred a protective effect against co-infection-induced gum inflammation. Here, we advance a novel infectious mechanism by which F. nucleatum co-opts P. gingivalis to exacerbate gum infections. FomA is highlighted as a potential target for development of new therapeutics against periodontal infection and halitosis in humans.
TI  - Lemierre's syndrome, reemergence of a forgotten disease: a case report.
AB  - Lemierre's syndrome is a rare disorder of young adults caused by the anaerobic bacterium, Fusobacterium necrophorum and occasionally by other Fusobacterium species (F. nucleatum, F. mortiferum and F. varium etc). The condition is characterized by a primary oropharyngeal infection with evidence of septic thrombophlebitis, exhibited by positive blood cultures, clinical or radiographic evidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis, and at least one metastatic focus. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome is reported to be nearly one in a million. In the pre-antibiotic era, Lemierre's syndrome followed a fulminant, often fatal course. During the 1960s and 1970s, the syndrome was rarely reported when penicillin was commonly prescribed to treat oropharyngeal infections. Today, antibiotic-resistant organisms are a major concern, thus causing more prudent prescribing of antibiotics. We present a case report of a 27-year-old man with worsening pharyngitis, which illustrates that subsequent reemergence of this often forgotten disease may become more common in clinical setting.
TI  - Lemierre syndrome: a Japanese patient returning from Thailand.
AB  - After returning from Thailand, a 23-year-old Japanese man was admitted because of fever, sore throat, neck pain, and chest pain. Contrasted-enhanced CT scanning of his neck revealed an absence of flow through the right internal jugular vein representing thrombosis, and moreover, an increase in wall thickness of the right internal jugular vein and enhancement of the surrounding tissue representing thrombophlebitis. Lung abscesses were also identified by a chest CT scan. Fusobacterium nucleatum was cultured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. He was diagnosed with Lemierre syndrome, and a good result was obtained by the administration of antibiotics. Physicians are encouraged to be aware of this syndrome when they manage patients complaining of neck pain and fever.
TI  - The relationship between physiologic halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria of the tongue and gingival sulcus.
AB  - To determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. Halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) = H(2)S + CH(3)SH + (CH(3))(2)S]; Halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (PlCR), plaque index (PlI), and tongue coat status. Significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for PlCR, PlI, tongue coat status, VSC amounts, and Halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. Significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total VSC, H(2)S and CH(3)SH amounts, and Halimeter values were observed only for T. denticola and F. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. Thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.
TI  - Central role of the early colonizer Veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. Bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. Lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. Fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. Of six species tested, only the initial colonizer Actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. The initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. The early colonizer Veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. The biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when Veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. All three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., A. oris, Veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer Porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. Further specificity was seen when Fusobacterium nucleatum (a middle colonizer), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and P. gingivalis did not grow with S. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of Veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. We propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.
TI  - Effects of a mouthwash with chlorine dioxide on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized placebo-controlled 7-day trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown the oxidizing properties and microbiological efficacies of chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Its clinical efficacies on oral malodor have been evaluated and reported only in short duration trials, moreover, no clinical studies have investigated its microbiological efficacies on periodontal and malodorous bacteria. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the inhibitory effects of a mouthwash containing ClO2 used for 7 days on morning oral malodor and on salivary periodontal and malodorous bacteria. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized, double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 15 healthy male volunteers, who were divided into 2 groups. Subjects were instructed to rinse with the experimental mouthwash containing ClO2 or the placebo mouthwash, without ClO2, twice per day for 7 days. After a one week washout period, each group then used the opposite mouthwash for 7 days. At baseline and after 7 days, oral malodor was evaluated with Organoleptic measurement (OM), and analyzed the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S), the main VSCs of human oral malodor, were assessed by gas chromatography (GC). Clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices, and tongue coating index. The samples of saliva were microbiologically investigated. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-Invader method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The baseline oral condition in healthy subjects in the 2 groups did not differ significantly. After rinsing with the mouthwash containing ClO2 for 7 days, morning bad breath decreased as measured by the OM and reduced the concentrations of H2S, CH3SH and (CH3)2S measured by GC, were found. Moreover ClO2 mouthwash used over a 7-day period appeared effective in reducing plaque, tongue coating accumulation and the counts of Fusobacterium nucleatum in saliva. Future research is needed to examine long-term effects, as well as effects on periodontal diseases and plaque accumulation in a well-defined sample of halitosis patients and broader population samples. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00748943.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
AB  - This investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. Microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. Ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. The triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest MICs and significantly inhibited Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). In the ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. Similarly, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). No significant differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices (p > 0.5).
TI  - Effects of methyl gallate and gallic acid on the production of inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 by oral epithelial cells stimulated with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Interactions between periodontal bacteria and human oral epithelial cells can lead to the activation and expression of a variety of inflammatory mediators in epithelial cells. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a filamentous human pathogen that is strongly associated with periodontal diseases. This study examined the effects of methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) on the production of inflammatory mediators, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, by oral epithelial cells stimulated by F. nucleatum. In a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, live F. nucleatum induced high levels of gene expression and protein release of IL-6 and IL-8. The effects of MG and GA were examined by treating KB oral epithelial cells with MG and GA and stimulating them with F. nucleatum. MG and GA inhibited significantly the increases in the IL-6 and IL-8 gene and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. These Compounds also inhibited the growth of F. nucleatum. No visible effects of MG and GA on the adhesion and invasion of KB cells by F. nucleatum were observed. In conclusion, both MG and GA inhibit IL-6 and IL-8 production from F. nucleatum-activated KB cells.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of a Genius Nd:YAG laser.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the Nd:YAG laser (Genius, MOlsgaard Dental, Copenhagen, Denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. METHODS: Suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra) were prepared in small Eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a Nd:YAG laser for five different periods of time. Laser settings used: Power 6 Watt (on a scale of 1-12 W), Frequency 50 Hz, Pulse duration 250 mus. After exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. RESULTS: After 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. After 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. CONCLUSION: In this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of Nd:YAG laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  - AIM: The dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. Human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. The aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 secretion induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HGECs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Primary HGECs challenged with live P. gingivalis produced high levels of IL-1beta, while challenge with live A. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of IL-8. The opportunistic pathogen F. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal S. gordonii is the least stimulatory. CONCLUSION: We conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria induce different cytokine response profiles in primary HGECs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.
TI  - Use of a novel assay to evaluate enzymes that produce hydrogen sulfide in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - To evaluate enzymes that produce hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in species of Fusobacterium nucleatum, we developed an assay based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with renaturation followed by active staining. This assay provided precise insight into the enzymes that produce H(2)S in terms of their number and molecular weights.
TI  - Efficacy of a low-concentration chlorhexidine mouth rinse in non-compliant periodontitis patients attending a supportive periodontal care programme: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and microbiological efficacy of a 0.05% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetyl-pyridinium chloride mouth rinse in supportive periodontal care (SPC) in patients with inadequate plaque control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis under SPC with an inadequate plaque control (Turesky index >1). After supragingival prophylaxis and oral hygiene reinforcement, participants rinsed twice a day for 3 months with the test or placebo solutions, in addition to conventional hygiene. Primary clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices. As secondary outcomes, periodontal and microbiological variables were studied. ancova and chi(2) tests were used to compare the variables. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (22 placebo and 25 test group) participated. After 3 months, plaque levels increased in the placebo group, while diminished in the test group (p<0.001). Similar effects were found for bleeding on probing. The other clinical parameters did not show significant differences. Microbiological variables demonstrated inter-group significant reductions in subgingival counts of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia and a decrease of the total bacterial counts in saliva. CONCLUSIONS: The tested mouth rinse demonstrated efficacy in reducing plaque and gingivitis, as well as in decreasing the microbial load in saliva and gingival sulcus.
TI  - Substrate-dependent proton antiport in neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.
AB  - Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl(-)-independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium ion-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl(-) dependent. We reasoned that the negative charge--provided either by Cl(-) or by the transporter itself--is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na(+) gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na(+)/substrate symport elicited H(+) efflux, indicative of Na(+)/substrate symport-coupled H(+) antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl(-) dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions.
TI  - [Pelvic actinomycosis: a misleading picture].
AB  - Pelvic actinomycosis is a rare chronic suppurative granulomatous disease associated with an intrauterine contraceptive device. Next pelvic organs can be affected but also more distant organs, to lead to different clinical situations. The diagnosis is therefore often difficult. We report here the case of a woman who presents a particular extensive pelvic actinomycosis diagnosed after surgical treatment with important morbidity. This case shows the interest of evoking the diagnosis in an evocative clinical context, doing the necessary exams to confirm the hypothesis, favouring medical treatment and reserving surgical treatment for particular situations.
TI  - In vitro killing activity of crevicular concentrations of tinidazole plus common  oral antibiotics against high-density mixed inocula of periodontal pathogens in strict anaerobic conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Odontogenic infections are polymicrobial. This study explores the in  vitro killing activity by concentrations similar to those found in crevicular fluid of tinidazole in combination with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and levofloxacin against four groups of high-density mixed inocula of anaerobes (Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella spp.) and facultative (Capnocytophaga spp. and Streptococcus spp.) isolates of periodontal pathogens. METHODS: Killing curves were assessed under strict anaerobic conditions with antibiotics alone and in combination with tinidazole at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid against approximately 10(7) colony forming units (CFU)/ml inoculum (1:1:1:1:1 proportion of the five bacterial isolates) of the four bacterial groups. Group 1 did not include beta-lactamase-producing strains; groups 2, 3, and 4 included one, two, and three beta-lactamase-producing strains, respectively. RESULTS: In single-drug experiments, at 48 hours, tinidazole alone did not show significant killing of the entire bacterial population, whereas reductions in the initial inocula > or =2.09 log(10) CFU/ml with clindamycin, > or =3.26 log(10) CFU/ml with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and > or =3.83 log(10) CFU/ml with levofloxacin were obtained. When combined with tinidazole, reductions were significantly higher for all antibiotics: > or =5.28 log(10) CFU/ml with clindamycin, > or =4.78 log(10) CFU/ml with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and > or =6.17 log(10) CFU/ml with levofloxacin. CONCLUSION: In addition to its high activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens, tinidazole offered synergism with other antibiotics against the large strict anaerobic subpopulation and the small facultative subpopulation of a high-density mixed inocula of odontogenic pathogens under strict anaerobic conditions, similar to those of odontogenic infections.
TI  - Microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. The main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) within 48 hours. METHODS: This was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. Fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours; then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). Pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. Six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were followed for 6 months. After treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; P = 0.005; month 6). Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. However, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. Lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for Porphyromonas gingivalis (P = 0.013) and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (P = 0.007). However, even subjects testing negative for A. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. The presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (A. actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum spp., P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and T. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth SRP with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.
TI  - Differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors SLPI, elafin,  SCCA1, and SCCA2.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (SLPI), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (SCCA1 and SCCA2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. To determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (GECs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants of various periopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. DESIGN: The gene expression and secretion of SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were determined using real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The direct effects of periopathogens and P. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by Western Blot. The effect on the innate immune response of GECs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hBD2) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20). RESULTS: We found that SLPI, SCCA2, elafin, hBD2, and CCL20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to P. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in response to stimulation by other bacteria. P. gingivalis reduced the secretion of SLPI and elafin significantly in GECs, and degraded recombinant SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2. Differential degradation patterns of SLPI, elafin, SCCA1, and SCCA2 were observed with different bacteria as well as P. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by P. gingivalis. In addition, pretreatment of GECs with SLPI, SCCA1, or SCCA2 partially blocked hBD2 and CCL20 mRNA expression in response to P. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. The balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.
TI  - Osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and DNA-DNA hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible after radiation therapy. DESIGN: Bacterial DNA was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, transformed into Escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. RESULTS: From the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. The predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FG014, uncultured bacterium clone RL178, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella spp. The study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in ORN. In contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of ORN in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. To better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with ORN is necessary.
TI  - Preterm low birthweight and the role of oral bacteria.
AB  - Preterm and low birthweight (PTLBW) continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity across the world. In recent years, maternal periodontal disease has been implicated as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is conflicting evidence to support such an outcome as illustrated by descriptive, case control and randomised controlled trials involving pregnant women from across the world, using different measurement tools to determine the level of periodontal disease. Whilst considering the literature, there is evidence for both arguments, based on the effect of periodontal inflammatory by products. Bacteria associated with periodontal disease are not dissimilar to those known to be associated with genito-urinary bacterial infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several groups have demonstrated the apparent translocation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonus gingivalis, Treponema denticola to the foetal placental unit whereby a maternal or foetal response has been detected resulting in premature birth or low birthweight. The normal process of parturition involves a cascade of events including a build-up of inflammatory mediators as linked to inflammation, whereby the maternal environment becomes hostile and threatens the well-being of the infant, and the foetus expelled. The question remains therefore, is there a greater risk of delivering a PTLBW infant when the mother has detectable periodontal disease, or is the release of inflammatory mediators and their translocation via the haematogenous route sufficient to induce a poor pregnancy outcome? The data investigated would suggest that there is a positive outcome when certain oral gram-negative bacteria create a cumulative effect sufficient to trigger early delivery, which represents the final straw to result in preterm or low birthweight delivery. There is equally sufficient epidemiological evidence that does not support this outcome, but it is agreed that maintaining oral health during pregnancy is beneficial to the mother and her infant.
TI  - NOD1 and NOD2 mediate sensing of periodontal pathogens.
AB  - In bacterial infection, Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2 induce innate immune responses by recognizing fragments of the bacterial component peptidoglycan (PGN). To determine the roles of these receptors in detection of periodontal pathogens, we stimulated human embryonic kidney cells expressing NOD1 or NOD2 with heat-killed Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum or their soluble PGNs (sPGNs). All bacteria and their sPGNs could stimulate activation of NF-kappaB. However, there were differences in NOD1- and NOD2-stimulatory activities among the species of bacteria. P. gingivalis showed weaker NOD1- and NOD2-stimulatory activities than did other bacteria. These differences in activities were confirmed by production of interleukin-8 from oral epithelial cells stimulated with sPGNs. These findings indicate that both NOD1 and NOD2 might be involved in the recognition of periodontal pathogens, and that the weak NOD-stimulatory property of P. gingivalis might be helpful for survival in the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Bacterial adhesins to host components in periodontitis.
AB  
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum envelope protein FomA is immunogenic and binds to the salivary statherin-derived peptide.
AB  - We have previously shown that one of the minimal active regions of statherin, a human salivary protein, for binding to Fusobacterium nucleatum is a YQPVPE amino acid sequence. In this study, we identified the FomA protein of F. nucleatum, which is responsible for binding to the statherin-derived YQPVPE peptide. Overlay analysis showed that a 40-kDa protein of the F. nucleatum cell envelope (40-kDa CE) specifically bound to the YQPVPE peptide. The equilibrium association constant between the affinity-purified 40-kDa CE and the YQPVPE peptide was 4.30 x 10(6). Further, the purity and amino acid sequence analyses of the purified 40-kDa CE revealed approximately 98.7% (wt/wt) purity and a high degree of homology with FomA, a major porin protein of F. nucleatum. Thus, a FomA-deficient mutant failed to bind to the YQPVPE peptide. In addition, increased levels of a FomA-specific mucosal IgA antibody (Ab) and plasma IgG and IgA Abs were seen only in mice immunized nasally with cholera toxin (CT) and the purified 40-kDa FomA protein. Interestingly, saliva from mice that received FomA plus CT as a mucosal adjuvant nasally prevented in vitro binding of F. nucleatum to statherin-coated polyvinyl chloride plates. Taken together, these results suggest that induction of specific immunity to the 40-kDa FomA protein of F. nucleatum, which specifically binds to the statherin-derived peptide, may be an effective tool for preventing the formation of F. nucleatum biofilms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Identification of bacteria enduring endodontic treatment procedures by a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse-capture checkerboard approach.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16S ribosomal RNA-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. METHODS: Samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (S1), after chemomechanical preparation with NaOCl as the irrigant (S2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (S3). Bacterial presence was first screened by a DNA-based single PCR assay. RNA extracts were subjected to RT-PCR, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. RESULTS: Bacteria were found in all S1 samples. Detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal RNA, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. The most prevalent taxa in S1 were Olsenella uli (67%), Pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), Streptococcus species (53%), and Bacteroidetes clone X083 (53%). Streptococcus species (47%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and O. uli (33%) prevailed in S2, whereas Streptococcus species (47%), Propionibacterium acnes (27%), and O. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in S3. CONCLUSIONS: The present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. Although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.
TI  - Transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  - PURPOSE: Prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. Infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. The aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. Subgingival plaque samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. Samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. Detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The detection rates for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and F. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that colonization by A. actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and F. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.
TI  - Application of rpoB and zinc protease gene for use in molecular discrimination of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is classified into five subspecies that inhabit the human oral cavity (F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme, F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii, and F. nucleatum subsp. animalis) based on several phenotypic characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization patterns. However, the methods for detecting or discriminating the clinical isolates of F. nucleatum at the subspecies levels are laborious, expensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, the nucleotide sequences of the RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene (rpoB) and zinc protease gene were analyzed to discriminate the subspecies of F. nucleatum. The partial sequences of rpoB (approximately 2,419 bp), the zinc protease gene (878 bp), and 16S rRNA genes (approximately 1,500 bp) of the type strains of five subspecies, 28 clinical isolates of F. nucleatum, and 10 strains of F. periodonticum (as a control group) were determined and analyzed. The phylogenetic data showed that the rpoB and zinc protease gene sequences clearly delineated the subspecies of F. nucleatum and provided higher resolution than the 16S rRNA gene sequences in this respect. According to the phylogenetic analysis of rpoB and the zinc protease gene, F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii and F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme might be classified into a single subspecies. Five clinical isolates could be delineated as a new subspecies of F. nucleatum. The results suggest that rpoB and the zinc protease gene are efficient targets for the discrimination and taxonomic analysis of the subspecies of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Fusobacterium bacteremia: clinical significance and outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fusobacterium bacteremia is uncommon, accounting for approximately 0.9% of patients with bacteremia. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of blood cultures positive for Fusobacterium spp., risk factors for mortality, and the impact of antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a 5-year retrospective study in which the medical records of patients with Fusobacterium bacteremia treated at the Division of Infectious Diseases, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, from 2002 to 2006 were analyzed. RESULTS: Fusobacterium spp. accounted for 0.74% of 16,676 positive blood cultures. 123 patients were included in the study, 53 of whom had polymicrobial bacteremia (43.1%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most common species identified (41.5%). The mean age +/- standard deviation of the patients was 62.6 +/- 18.9 years. The most common sources of bacteremia were the gastrointestinal tract, lower respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue. Thirty four patients (27.6%) had no definite loci of infection. The overall mortality rate was 40.7% (50 patients), which was not associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy (p = 0.950), Fusobacterium spp., source of infection, or polymicrobial bacteremia. Shock, lack of fever at presentation, and underlying diseases (heart failure, renal insufficiency, or malignancy) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Fusobacterium bacteremia was associated with a high mortality rate for patients with renal insufficiency, heart failure, or malignancy. Delayed start of appropriate antimicrobial therapy did not impact the outcomes.
TI  - Methamphetamine cytotoxicity and effect on LPS-stimulated IL-1beta production by  human monocytes.
AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) abuse is associated with "METH mouth", characterized by rampant dental decay and destruction of periodontal bone and soft tissues. In periodontitis, monocyte/macrophages, stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), produce interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), contributing to bone and soft tissue degradation. Effects of METH on monocyte/macrophages and its role in periodontitis are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine METH cytotoxicity and effects on constitutive and LPS-stimulated IL-1beta production in THP-1 human monocytes. METH significantly reduced cell viability, assessed by activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, by 20-40% after 24h, with recovery at longer periods. Brief exposure to METH caused <10% cytotoxicity (measured by an assay that detects membrane damage). LPS from E. coli or the periodontopathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.) significantly increased IL-1beta production (measured by ELISA). Despite cytotoxicity of some METH concentrations, METH had no significant effect on constitutive IL-1beta production. However, METH generally increased LPS-stimulated IL-1beta levels, reaching statistical significance at 5x10(-5)M METH ( approximately 50% to >100% increase). The study suggests that METH potentiation of periodontopathogen LPS stimulation of IL-1beta in monocytes could contribute to periodontitis in METH abusers, consistent with other studies suggesting a role for increased IL-1beta in deleterious effects of METH.
TI  - Acute appendicitis is characterised by local invasion with Fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is a local intestinal inflammation with unclear origin. The aim was to test whether bacteria in appendicitis differ in composition to bacteria found in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We investigated sections of 70 appendices using rRNA-based fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Four hundred caecal biopsies and 400 faecal samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions were used as controls. A set of 73 group-specific bacterial probes was applied for the study. RESULTS: The mucosal surface in catarrhal appendicitis showed characteristic lesions of single epithelial cells filled with a mixed bacterial population ('pinned cells') without ulceration of the surroundings. Bacteria deeply infiltrated the tissue in suppurative appendicitis. Fusobacteria (mainly Fusobacterium nucleatum and necrophorum) were a specific component of these epithelial and submucosal infiltrates in 62% of patients with proven appendicitis. The presence of Fusobacteria in mucosal lesions correlated positively with the severity of the appendicitis and was completely absent in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. Main faecal microbiota represented by Bacteroides, Eubacterium rectale (Clostridium group XIVa), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups and Akkermansia muciniphila were inversely related to the severity of the disease. The occurrence of other bacterial groups within mucosal lesions of acute appendicitis was not related to the severity of the appendicitis. No Fusobacteria were found in rectal swabs of patients with acute appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS: Local infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum is responsible for the majority of cases of acute appendicitis.
TI  - Sonic extracts from a bacterium related to periapical disease activate gelatinase A and inactivate tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.
AB  - AIM: To examine the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (SBEs) from three related to periapical disease bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum) on the activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) and the inactivation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). METHODOLOGY: Each SBE was added to cultures of human periodontal ligament (PL) cells or HT1080 cells and their supernatants were analysed by zymography for MMP-2. Each SBE was added to PL cell cultures, and the amount of TIMP-1 was determined by ELISA. P. gingivalis SBE was incubated with HT1080 cell culture supernatants, and the amounts of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were determined by ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed with the paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: In extracts of PL cells that had been incubated in the presence of P. gingivalis SBE, one representing pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) and a band corresponding to the active MMP-2 (66 kDa) were observed; but in the other extracts it was not detected. When HT1080 cells were treated with P. gingivalis SBE, the pro-MMPs was processed into 86- and 66-kDa fragments, but in the other extracts, the processing did not occur when the other SBEs were used. When PL cells were incubated with the same SBEs, the amount of TIMP-1 was markedly decreased (P < 0.01), but in the other extracts, it was not. The amounts of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner when HT1080 cell culture supernatant was incubated with P. gingivalis SBE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that P. gingivalis SBE may cause connective tissue to be destroyed, contributing to the process of periapical disease, by activating pro-MMP-2 as well as by inactivating TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.
TI  - Hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (VSCs) produced by oral bacteria. This study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. METHODS: L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (METase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta C-S) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. Enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. The enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing L-cysteine or DL-homocysteine were assayed. RESULTS: With L-cysteine as the substrate, Streptococcus anginosus FW73 produced the most hydrogen sulfide, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 33277 and W83 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the P. gingivalis strains. Finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. Using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. However, further innovation is required for practical use.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of periodontal pathogens obtained from frequent antibiotic  users.
AB  - The occurrence of bacterial strains resistant to different antimicrobials is a growing problem in Latin American countries. The aim was to measure the antimicrobial susceptibility of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Prophyromona gingivalis, isolated from chronic periodontitis patients. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with generalized- moderate or advanced- chronic periodontitis were consecutively recruited from patients attending the Periodontal Specialist Program, Javeriana University, according to specific criteria, including no recent antibiotic consumption. All patients filled out a questionnaire on antibiotic intake. The deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant was sampled. Pooled samples were mixed, diluted and plated on enriched brucella agar plates. After anaerobic incubation, identification of the target bacteria was performed, based on colony morphology, gram staining, aerotolerance and biochemical reactions (RapID Ana II, Remel, U.S.A.). Following identification, the bacteria were subjected to antimicrobial testing, using amoxicillin, tetracycline, doxycicline, azithromycin and metronidazole (E-test, AbBiodisk, Sweden). The minimal inhibitory concentrations obtained were compared with a reference standard to determine antimicrobial resistance. Amoxicillin-resistant species were tested for beta-lactamase production. Forty-four percent of the patients used antibiotics without any medical prescription, 40% used antibiotics at least once a year. The presence of eleven species was confirmed after a series of biochemical tests: four Fusobacterium nucleatum, five Prevotella intermedia and two Prophyromona gingivalis. All strains were resistant to metronidazole, five were resistant to tetracycline and azithromicin, and two strains were resistant to doxycicline and amoxicillin. The strains resistant to amoxicillin were positive for beta-lactamase production, Antimicrobial resistance, particularly against metronidazole, was a common phenomenon for the bacterial isolates analyzed in this Colombian sample.
TI  - Autoaggregation response of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative oral bacterial species associated with periodontal disease progression. This species is perhaps best known for its ability to adhere to a vast array of other bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Numerous studies of F. nucleatum have examined various coaggregation partners and inhibitors, but it is largely unknown whether these interactions induce a particular genetic response. We tested coaggregation between F. nucleatum ATCC strain 25586 and various species of Streptococcus in the presence of a semidefined growth medium containing saliva. We found that this condition could support efficient coaggregation but, surprisingly, also stimulated a similar degree of autoaggregation. We further characterized the autoaggregation response, since few reports have examined this in F. nucleatum. After screening several common coaggregation inhibitors, we identified l-lysine as a competitive inhibitor of autoaggregation. We performed a microarray analysis of the planktonic versus autoaggregated cells and found nearly 100 genes that were affected after only about 60 min of aggregation. We tested a subset of these genes via real-time reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed the validity of the microarray results. Some of these genes were also found to be inducible in cell pellets created by centrifugation. Based upon these data, it appears that autoaggregation activates a genetic program that may be utilized for growth in a high cell density environment, such as the oral biofilm.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial flora in persistent apical periodontitis lesions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms are able to survive and induce persistent infection  in periapical tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of the microflora of persistent apical periodontitis lesions. METHODS: Twenty apical lesion samples were obtained from 20 patients with chronic apical periodontitis by root end surgery and processed using aerobic or anaerobic culture techniques. All isolated strains were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four strains were isolated, belonging to 31 bacterial species obtained from the 20 apical lesions that were isolated. The majority of the strains were facultative anaerobes (51.6%). Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated from 16.2, 9.5, 6.8 and 5.4% of the samples, respectively. Fifteen samples harboured more than one species. The predominant association was P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: The microbiota of persistent apical periodontitis lesions is composed by diverse types of microorganisms with biofilm-forming capacity, including P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. Diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. Predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. The aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. METHODS: During a 12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. RESULTS: No clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. In sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between P. gingivalis and T. forsythia (r = 0.55, P < 0.001) and T. denticola and T. forsythia (r = 0.43, P = 0.04). The odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of P. gingivalis and T. denticola. CONCLUSION: Monitoring the proportions of P. gingivalis and T. denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.
TI  - Involvement of cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha in MMP-9 up-regulation.
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is important in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha) is involved in MMP-9 up-regulation in human monocytes. We tested the hypothesis that cPLA(2)alpha also regulates MMP-9 induction by Fusobacterium nucleatum and by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) in gingival epithelial cells. While PMA induced MMP-9 expression considerably, F. nucleatum did so moderately. This time-course study demonstrated that MMP-9 mRNA up-regulation occurred at 3 hours, whereas MMP-9 secretion and activity in cell-free supernatants occurred at 12 hours. cPLA(2)alpha mRNA was constitutively expressed in gingival epithelial cells. Transient activation of cPLA(2) by Ser505 phosphorylation was observed in the nuclei upon stimulation, suggesting its role as a transcription factor, while cPLA(2) protein expression remained unchanged. Induction of MMP-9 expression and activity was significantly inhibited by 1 muM of the specific cPLA(2)alpha inhibitor (P < 0.01). These findings demonstrate the involvement of cPLA(2)alpha in MMP-9 up-regulation.
TI  - Microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  - The inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. Bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. It was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. In this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by human cells were investigated. The beneficial species, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the IL-8 production triggered by A. actinomycetemcomitans. The inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. In contrast, the commensal Streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum increased IL-8 production by the host cells. These results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (PDT) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (UST) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. In a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. They were treated either with UST (n = 29) or PDT (n = 25). Clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. For UST, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for PDT from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. Microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. PDT is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.
TI  - Differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis. Host cell invasion by P. gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on P. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. P. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line Ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. Among the pathogens tested, only Fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote P. gingivalis invasion (P<0.01). This increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. In contrast, co-infection with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or Tannerella forsythia attenuated P. gingivalis invasion. The fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. These results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by P. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.
TI  - Kinetic characterization and quaternary structure of glutamate racemase from the  periodontal anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Cofactor-independent glutamate racemases (GRs) that supply the d-glutamate required for biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan that encapsulates bacterial cells are attractive targets for the development of antibacterial drugs. Recombinant GR from Fusobacterium nucleatum (FnGR), a Gram-negative anaerobe involved in periodontal disease, was overproduced, purified, and characterized. Unlike most other GRs, FnGR is a pseudosymmetric enzyme, catalyzing the racemization of glutamate enantiomers with similar kinetic parameters (k(cat)(L-->D)=17.4+/-0.8s(-1), K(m)(L-->D)=1.04+/-0.07mM, k(cat)(D-->L)=26+/-1s(-1), and K(m)(D-->L)=1.7+/-0.1mM; [corrected] pH optimum approximately 8.5). Mutational analysis of residue 151 (A151V) located at the entryway to the active site revealed that FnGR is very sensitive to increased steric bulk at this position. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Ferguson plot analyses, and cross-linking studies, indicated that FnGR existed predominately as dimers. Unlike Bacillus subtilis GR, the presence of glutamate did not significantly alter the position of the monomer-dimer equilibrium of FnGR.
TI  - An unusual autopsy case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) formation is thought to originate from the transmission of infection via three major routes including the biliary tract, portal vein and hepatic artery. However, about 50% of PLA cases are considered to be cryptogenic. Here we report an unusual autopsy case of PLA associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. A 59-year-old female suddenly developed cardiopulmonary arrest and died. Despite macroscopic and microscopic examinations, the infectious routes and source of infection were unidentified, and the case appeared to be cryptogenic. Since this patient had suffered severe periodontitis for a long period of time, we investigated the involvement of periodontal infection in PLA formation by performing immunohistochemical analyses. We identified several periodontopathic bacterial species in the PLA of this patient, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Thus, we demonstrate here that periodontal infection is a potential source of infection in the formation of PLA.
TI  - Mobilization and prevalence of a Fusobacterial plasmid.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic rod found in dental plaque biofilms, and is an opportunistic pathogen implicated in periodontitis as well as a wide range of systemic abscesses and infections. Genomic analyses of F. nucleatum indicate considerable genetic diversity and a prominent role for horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of the species. Several plasmids isolated from F. nucleatum, including pFN1, harbor relaxase gene homologs that may function in plasmid mobilization. In this investigation we examined the RP4-mediated mobilization properties of pFN1 and the prevalence of pFN1-related sequences in a panel of F. nucleatum clinical isolates. The fusobacterial plasmid pFN1 was mobilized by RP4 at a high frequency. Deletion analyses were used to delineate the core mobilon of pFN1, which consisted of the relaxase gene (rlx), an upstream open reading frame ORF4 and a region of DNA upstream of ORF4 with potential nic sites. To examine the prevalence of pFN1 in a panel of clinical isolates, total DNA isolated from the strains was hybridized with pFN1 replication (repA) and rlx gene probes. DNA from strains harboring plasmids known to be homologous to pFN1 hybridized with both the repA and rlx probes. Five additional strains were rlx-positive but repA-negative, indicating a greater prevalence of rlx-related genes in comparison with repA-related genes. Plasmid or plasmid-related sequences were identified in 11.5% of the strains examined. These findings demonstrate mobilization properties of a fusobacterial plasmid that may be important in horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Mutualistic biofilm communities develop with Porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. We report here that P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. Integration of P. gingivalis into multispecies communities was investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. In flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using species-specific primers. P. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinomyces oris, as well as with Veillonella sp. (early colonizer), Fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). In three-species flow cells, P. gingivalis grew with Veillonella sp. and A. actinomycetemcomitans but not with S. oralis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Also, it grew with Veillonella sp. and F. nucleatum but not with S. oralis and F. nucleatum, indicating that P. gingivalis and S. oralis are not compatible. However, P. gingivalis grew in combination with S. gordonii and S. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. Collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of P. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum endocarditis mimicking polymyalgia rheumatica.
AB  - A case of Fusobacterium nucleatum endocarditis in an 80-year-old man is reported. The patient presented with a headache and nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms and was misdiagnosed as having polymyalgia rheumatica. The diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was delayed because of an insidious presentation, typical in infections with low virulence micro-organisms. The musculoskeletal symptoms, unresponsive to protracted corticosteroids, completely resolved with intravenous ampicillin treatment. Rheumatologic symptoms may hinder the correct diagnosis of subacute infective endocarditis. An atypical evolution of a common rheumatic disorder such as polymyalgia rheumatica should alert physicians to the possibility of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Maternal periodontal disease and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 expression.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to examine the relationship between maternal periodontal disease and plasma angiogenic factor expression of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt)-1. METHODS: This was a nested case-control study of 220 women, including 45 healthy women with evidence of active periodontal disease, 98 women without evidence of active periodontal disease, 13 women with fetal exposure to oral pathogens, and 64 women without fetal exposure to oral pathogens. Active periodontal disease was defined as the presence of moderate/severe periodontal disease and evidence of periodontal disease progression. Fetal exposure to oral pathogens was determined by fetal immunoglobulin M (IgM) umbilical cord seropositivity. Maternal plasma was collected at <26 weeks of gestation; umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery. sFlt-1 was measured with an immunoradiometric assay. Demographic and medical data were chart abstracted. Maternal variables and sFlt-1 concentrations were compared between cases and controls using the Student t and chi(2) tests and analysis of variance. RESULTS: The median sFlt-1 concentration at the time of enrollment for all women was 2,374 pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 1,504 to 3,194 pg/ml). Women with evidence of fetal exposure to oral pathogens had significantly higher sFlt-1 concentrations compared to IgM-negative fetuses (3,383 pg/ml [IQR: 2,610 to 4,244 pg/ml] versus 2,123 pg/ml [IQR: 1,456 to 3,011 pg/ml]; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Fetal exposure to oral pathogens was associated with increased plasma concentrations of sFlt-1 early in pregnancy.
TI  - Contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. Although this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. METHODS: Biofilms of Streptococcus sanguinis, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in NaOCl, EDTA, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. The number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. The majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. The most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was NaOCl. Iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. The effectiveness of NaOCl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.
TI  - The effect of lactoferrin on oral bacterial attachment.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. We hypothesized that Lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. The objective was to investigate the effect of Lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. METHODS: Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. Glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3 ml/min) with and without Lf (100 microg/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3 h, 37 degrees C). Attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) with Lf-coated (20-100 microg/ml) and uncoated glass slides. The effects of beta-lactoglobulin, 2,2'-dipyridyl (25-100 microg/ml), an iron chelator, and FeCl3 on attachment were also examined. RESULTS: Lf inhibited the initial attachment of S. gordonii (50.3%, P < 0.05) but not that of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. However, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing S. gordonii (i.e. S. gordonii/F. nucleatum or S. gordonii/P. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, P < 0.05) in the presence of Lf. beta-Lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of S. gordonii. In the presence of 100 microm 2,2'-dipyridyl, attachment of S. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. No reduction in attachment was noted in S. gordonii pretreated with Lf (100 microg/ml) and FeCl3 (20-200 microm). CONCLUSION: Lf suppresses initial attachment of S. gordonii and S. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. This may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.
TI  - Oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can integrate into T cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. Reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger HIV reactivation leading to HIV recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active antiretroviral therapies. METHODS: This study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate HIV promoter activation in various cell models of HIV latency. RESULTS: T cells (1G5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of HIV promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. Direct bacterial challenge of the T cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. Challenge of macrophages (BF24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except Streptococcus mutans. Dendritic cells showed increases in HIV reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate HIV from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = T cells. Expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of intraradicular bacterial composition by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the bacterial community structures associated with endodontic infections using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and to investigate the correlation of whole community profiles with the manifestation of particular clinical features. METHODS: Intraradicular samples were collected from 34 subjects and classified into three study groups based on the observed clinical symptoms: acute (n = 16), sub-acute (n = 8), and asymptomatic (n = 10). Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample, submitted to polymerase chain reaction using a fluorescently labeled 16S ribosomal DNA forward primer, and digested with two tetrameric endonucleases (HhaI and MspI). The terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) were subsequently discriminated in an automated DNA sequencer, and the results were filtered using a statistics-based criterion. RESULTS: Totals of 138 (HhaI) and 145 (MspI) unique T-RFs were detected (means 13.1 and 11.9) and there was high inter-subject variability in the bacterial assemblages. Odds-ratio analysis unveiled the existence of higher order groups of positively associated T-RFs, restating the concept that intricate ecological relationships may take place in the root canal space. A significantly greater T-RF prevalence was detected in acute cases, suggesting a straight correlation between species richness and spontaneous pain. CONCLUSION: Overall, no T-RFLP profile representing a specific bacterial consortium could be associated with the manifestation of symptoms of endodontic origin.
TI  - Quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time PCR.
AB  - The present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. Before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group A were taken first with a paper point half length (HP) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (FP) at the same site. In group B sampling sequence was reversed. Analysis by real-time PCR enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (TBC). Statistical analysis included t test, Kappa, and Spearman's correlations. Higher TBC could be harvested by use of FP than by HP (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, CI [-1.515, -0.068], SD 0.770, p = 0.034; after therapy: -0.563, CI [-1.151, 0.024], SD 0.625, p = 0.059). The plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. Both, for TBC as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between HP and FP (Kappa, Spearman correlation: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; Fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; Porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; Prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; Treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and Tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). The recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of the periodontal lesion.
TI  - Use of 2-D electrophoresis and ESI mass spectrometry techniques to characterize Fusobacterium nucleatum proteins up-regulated after oxidative stress.
AB  - The genus Fusobacterium belongs to the Fusobacteriaceae family and is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobic bacterium found in the human oral microbiota. Even that Fusobacterium nucleatum cannot grow under aerobic conditions, they may exhibit aerotolerance as an adaptive response which could figure as an important virulence factor, during the stages of infection, when these anaerobes are shifted to aerobic conditions. In this regard, little is known about bacterial oxidative stress adaptive response and the influence of this adaptation on the host-bacteria relationship. We aimed to use both techniques 2-DE and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) to characterize proteins in F. nucleatum, after oxidative stress. We related three different proteins which were up-regulated by oxidative stress. As its genome is already sequenced, these proteins were found in data base search, by homology. Thus, by using techniques as ESI-Q/TOF-MS, in addition to 2-DE, the opportunity exists to gain a more holistic view of the bacterial proteome of human pathogens, to achieve a better understanding of species diversity and to elucidate the role of specific proteins in disease. This work represents one of the first studies using genetic and physiological approaches to understand the phenomenon of oxidative stress in F. nucleatum.
TI  - Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  - Oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. In this study, the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time PCR. Forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. Approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and DNA was obtained. Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific TaqMan probe/primer sets. Total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial DNA were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. All periodontal bacteria except for the F. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their DNA represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial DNA obtained from periodontitis patients. Porphyromonas gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected most often. The presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. In addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial DNA could be observed. The significant number of periodontopathic bacterial DNA species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.
TI  - Bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. The presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. This investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months after bone augmentation. METHODS: Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. Radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. RESULTS: The presence of periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia [previously T. forsythensis], Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra [previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros], Campylobacter rectus, enteric Gram-negative rods, and Dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, PCR, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. The PCR-positive triad, P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. The effect on the grafting outcome translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation. Specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.
TI  - [Preliminary study on the discrimination of putative periodontal pathogens with a metabonomics method].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of identifying oral pathogenic bacteria by comparing the metabolic profiling of putative periodontal pathogens and try to find a convenient and rapid way to discriminate oral microorganisms. METHODS: Suspensions of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum with same density were prepared and cultured respectively at liquid BHI medium. Then the growth quantity was measured periodically through turbidimetry and the growth curves of the inoculated bacteria were completed. The culture solutions of stable growth phase were sampled and characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance 1H-NMR). The data of 1H-NMR spectroscope results were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The PCA showed the obvious clustering phenomena and the points of three groups differentially centralized to three clusters. Therefore, the NMR-based metabonomics profiles could discriminate the three different kinds of bacteria. CONCLUSION: The metabonomics is a potential classable method to identify the oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Mixed infection involving Actinomyces, Aggregatibacter, and Fusobacterium species presenting as perispinal tumor.
AB  - A representative case in which a polymicrobial infection involving Fusobacterium  nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii and Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans was initially diagnosed as malignancy in an edentulous patient. Additional history obtained after the nature of the syndrome was elucidated revealed that he had had his two remaining teeth extracted four months prior to this episode.
TI  - Change in diet and oral hygiene over an 8-week period: effects on oral health and oral biofilm.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor changes in oral health and oral biofilm composition in vivo during an experiment simulating prehistoric lifestyle and diet and poor oral hygiene. Thirteen subjects lived for a period of 8 weeks under Neolithic conditions. The following clinical parameters were recorded before and after the project: gingival and plaque index (Loe and Silness, Acta Odontol Scand 21:533, 1963; Silness and Loe, Acta Odontol Scand 22:121-135, 1964), probing pocket depth, and bleeding upon probing. In addition, supragingival plaque samples were collected both before and after the project and were analysed quantitatively using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The following plaque bacteria were evaluated: Streptococcus spp., Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinomyces naeslundii. The plaque index increased significantly from 1.12 up to 1.55 over the 8-week period (gingival index before, 0.46; after, 0.93; p < 0.05). A strong correlation of both indices was recorded before (r = 0.77) and after (r = 0.83) participation in the study. Each of the children in the study showed a progression of carious lesions and/or new areas of demineralisation. The probing pocket depth and bleeding upon probing were not affected. All subjects yielded an intra-individual shift in biofilm composition. The proportion of F. nucleatum decreased across all subjects. The proportion of Veillonella spp. increased among the children. Poor oral hygiene and change of diet lead to an increase in oral plaque and gingival inflammation. The inter-individual comparison indicated a shift in bacterial composition.
TI  - Proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. Proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. METHODS: Endodontic specimens were aseptically obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. Protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-LC-MS/MS followed by a database search. RESULTS: Proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. Identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors, and antibiotic-resistance proteins. CONCLUSIONS: LC-MS/MS offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. The array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans builds mutualistic biofilm communities with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Veillonella species in saliva.
AB  - Human oral bacterial pathogens grow in attached multispecies biofilm communities. Unattached cells are quickly removed by swallowing. Therefore, surface attachment is essential for growth, and we investigated multispecies community interactions resulting in mutualistic growth on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We used two model systems, saliva-coated transferable solid-phase polystyrene pegs (peg biofilms) and flow cells with saliva-coated glass surfaces. Fluorescent antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in flow cells, and quantitative real-time PCR with species-specific primers was used to quantify the biomass in peg biofilms. Veillonella sp. strain PK1910, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans JP2, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 were unable to grow as single species in flow cells. Only A. actinomycetemcomitans grew after 36 h when peg biofilms remained submerged in saliva from the time of inoculation. Mixed-species coaggregates were used for two- and three-species inoculation. The biomass in two-species biofilms increased in both systems when Veillonella sp. strain PK1910 was present as one of the partners. Enhanced growth of all strains was observed in three-species biofilms in flow cells. Interestingly, in flow cells F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans exhibited mutualism, and, although F. nucleatum was unable to grow with either of the other species in the peg system, F. nucleatum stimulated the growth of Veillonella sp. and together these two organisms increased the total biomass of A. actinomycetemcomitans in three-species peg biofilms. We propose that mutualistic two-species and multispecies oral biofilm communities form in vivo and that mutualism between commensal veillonellae and late colonizing pathogens, such as aggregatibacteria, contributes to the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - Comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard DNA hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  - AIM: To compare polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-IDent test) and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and 3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. Samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. Similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. Differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty samples were evaluated using both techniques. Regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the PCR-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. The highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). Both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. CONCLUSION: Detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum enters normal human oral fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum, a commensal opportunistic oral bacterium, is capable of invading gingival epithelial cells, but the entrance into human primary oral fibroblast cells has not been documented. This study evaluated the ability of three strains of F. nucleatum (F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii) to enter gingival fibroblasts (GFs) and periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PLFs). METHODS: GFs and PLFs were cocultured for various periods of time with different strains of F. nucleatum. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, together with confocal laser scanning microscopy, were used to visualize the entrance and presence of bacteria in host cells. Flow cytometry was performed to compare the load of internalized bacteria in GFs and PLFs exposed for 3 and 5 hours to live F. nucleatum labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. RESULTS: All three strains of F. nucleatum were found entering and located in the cytoplasm of GFs and PLFs after 1 hour of exposure. Flow cytometry tests revealed a significant increase in the fluorescent signal, compared to baseline, derived from bacteria internalized in fibroblasts exposed for 3 hours (P <0.001); a further increase was found at 5 hours. The greatest bacterial mass in exposed fibroblasts of both types was of F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum; the smallest was of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii. Although not statistically significant, PLFs had a higher bacterial load than corresponding GFs. CONCLUSION: F. nucleatum was capable of entering GFs and PLFs in a manner that is dependent on the cell type and the bacterial strain.
TI  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the prevalence and copy number of epstein-barr virus and cytomegalovirus DNA in subgingival plaque at individual healthy and periodontal disease sites.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in plaque from patients with periodontal disease provides support for the theory that these viruses play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. This study sought to further define this relationship by determining the prevalence of these viruses at individual disease and healthy sites of patients with periodontal disease and to determine whether the presence and amount of viral DNA correlate with disease severity. METHODS: Subgingival plaque from three healthy and three disease sites of 65 patients who had chronic periodontitis were evaluated for the presence and amount of EBV, CMV, and Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patient serum was evaluated for antibodies against EBV and CMV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: EBV DNA was detected in 18.5% of subgingival plaque samples (72/390) and in at least one of the six plaque samples in 44.6% (29/65) of the patients. CMV DNA was detected in one plaque sample (0.3%). EBV was significantly more prevalent in disease sites (28.2%; 55/195) than in healthy sites (8.7%; 17/195; P = 0.002). However, neither EBV prevalence nor its amount correlated with increased probing depth >5 mm or attachment loss >2 mm, whereas the amount of F. nucleatum DNA did. Sites positive for EBV had a median copy number of eight. Antibodies against EBV and CMV were detected in 85.7% and 78.6% of persons evaluated, respectively. CONCLUSION: EBV was infrequent and CMV was rarely present in individual subgingival sites affected by chronic periodontitis.
TI  - A 21-year-old man with fever and abdominal pain after recent peritonsillar abscess drainage.
AB  - Lemierre syndrome an extremely rare and unreported disease typically results from oropharyngeal infection and/or local tissue trauma with invasion of the parapharyngeal soft tissue with bacteria. Once local tissue invasion occurs, internal jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis with or without metastatic complications may occur. The etiology of Lemierre syndrome is generally Fusobacterium necrophorum, reported to be present in approximately 80% of the cases. The outcome of Lemierre syndrome in the preantibiotic era was nearly always fatal. The outcome today with the appropriate antibiotic coverage is quite good. The management of a patient with suspected Lemierre syndrome should be aggressive and comprehensive. Blood cultures as well as cultures from infection sites should be obtained. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound are all appropriate modalities to detect the presence of internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis. Treatment of Lemierre syndrome consists of prolonged antibiotic therapy (4 to 6 weeks) with appropriate anaerobic coverage. Typical antibiotics include penicillins, metronidazole, or clindamycin. Surgical drainage of metastatic abscesses is often needed ensure resolution of this disease process. Persistent sore throat syndrome caused by F necrophorum has been reported in the literature and the General Practitioners should be aware of this entity because they may see this in their practice.
TI  - Starvation response and growth in serum of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella intermedia, and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  - The microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. We hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. This study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella intermedia and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. All species did not survive 1 day in water. In 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. They required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. The results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. These findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of enamel in situ investigated using fluorescence in situ  hybridization.
AB  - Oral biofilms are one of the greatest challenges in dental research. The present  study aimed to investigate initial bacterial colonization of enamel surfaces in situ using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) over a 12 h period. For this purpose, bovine enamel slabs were fixed on buccal sites of individual splints worn by six subjects for 2, 6 and 12 h to allow biofilm formation. Specimens were processed for FISH and evaluated with confocal laser-scanning microscopy, using probes for eubacteria, Streptococcus species, Veillonella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces naeslundii. The number of adherent bacteria increased with time and all tested bacterial species were detected in the biofilm formed in situ. The general percentage composition of the eubacteria did not change over the investigated period, but the number of streptococci, the most frequently detected species, increased significantly with time (2 h: 17.7+/-13.8 %; 6 h: 20.0+/-16.6 %; 12 h: 24.7+/-16.1 %). However, < or =1 % of the surface was covered with bacteria after 12 h of biofilm formation in situ. In conclusion, FISH is an appropriate method for quantifying initial biofilm formation in situ, and the proportion of streptococci increases during the first 12 h of bacterial adherence.
TI  - [Detection of luxS gene of quorum sensing signal system in periodontal pathogen].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the presence and distribution of luxS gene in quorum sensing signal system in the periodontal pathogens. METHODS: The total DNA of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Actinobacillus acitinomycetimcomtans (Aa) were extracted. The presence of luxS was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The products of PCR were detected by electrophoresis, sequenced and identified by a Blast search of the GenBank database. RESULTS: Electrophoresis, sequencing and Blast searching indicated that the PCR products of Pg were highly consistent with the luxS gene in GenBank. The sequencing result of Fn was also identified with the target gene. The PCR product of Aa was the same as reference through electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: Pg, Fn, Aa contain luxS gene. Further studies may be required to investigate the functions of luxS in the periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Systemic immune responses in pregnancy and periodontitis: relationship to pregnancy outcomes in the Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT) study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT) Study. This article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. METHODS: Serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola. RESULTS: At baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly lower total serum levels of IgG antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (P = 0.0018), to P. gingivalis (P = 0.0013), and to F. nucleatum (P = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. These differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. Changes in IgG levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. In addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of IgG antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. Changes in IgG antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.
TI  - Fetal exposure to oral pathogens and subsequent risk for neonatal intensive care  admission.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal periodontal infection has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. In utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens was also recognized as deleterious to the fetus. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fetal exposure to oral pathogens and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of maternal oral health and pregnancy outcome. Fetal immunoglobulin M against oral pathogens was detected in umbilical cord serum by immunoblot. The presence of at least one oral pathogen-specific antibody was considered seropositivity. The cord level of C-reactive protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and categorized as detectable versus undetectable. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between cord serum seropositivity or detectable C-reactive protein and NICU admission and length of stay. RESULTS: Of 650 infants, 45 (6.9%) were admitted to the NICU. The admission rate was higher among seropositive infants compared to seronegative infants (11% versus 5%; P = 0.0019). Seropositive infants were also more likely than seronegative infants to stay >3 or >7 days (8% versus 3% and 6% versus 2%; P = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). Adjusting for gestational age, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for NICU admission was 2.14 (1.01 to 4.54); for a length of stay >3 or >7 days, it was 2.38 (1.01 to 5.60) and 3.29 (1.13 to 9.58), respectively. The NICU admission rate was not significantly higher for those with detectable versus undetectable umbilical cord serum C-reactive protein (8% versus 6%; P = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: In utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens increases the risk for NICU admission and the length of stay. Interventions that interrupt fetal exposure to oral pathogens may reduce these risks.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, the first Gram-negative bacterium demonstrated to produce polyglutamate.
AB  - Poly-gamma-glutamate has been described in many Gram-positive organisms. When anchored to the surface, it is a capsule and as such a virulence factor. Based on sequence similarities, few Gram-negative organisms have been suggested to synthesize poly-gamma-glutamate. For the first time, a Gram-negative bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, is shown to produce and secrete poly-gamma-glutamate. Putative poly-gamma-glutamate-synthesizing genes from Gram-negative organisms have been compared with their Gram-positive homologs by in silico analysis, i.e., gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Clusters of three instead of four genes were highlighted by our screen. The products of the first two genes display similarity with their Gram-positive equivalents, yet the sequences from the Gram-negative organisms can be distinguished from those of the Gram-positives. Interestingly, the sequence of the predicted product of the third gene is conserved among Gram-negative bacteria but displays no similarity to that of either the third or fourth gene of the Gram-positive operons. It is suggested that, like for Gram-positive bacteria, poly-gamma-glutamate has a role in virulence for pathogens and one in survival for other Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Methods for optimizing DNA extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time PCR.
AB  - Methods for the optimal extraction of genomic DNA for real-time PCR enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, Parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of DNA content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time PCR approach. Evidence was obtained that P. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded DNA from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. This nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C overnight. A final purification of the DNA to remove any potential PCR inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of DNA by real-time PCR and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
TI  - Proteomics of Porphyromonas gingivalis within a model oral microbial community.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen that resides in a  complex multispecies microbial biofilm community known as dental plaque. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that P. gingivalis can assemble into communities in vitro with Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum, common constituents of dental plaque. Whole cell quantitative proteomics, along with mutant construction and analysis, were conducted to investigate how P. gingivalis adapts to this three species community. RESULTS: 1156 P. gingivalis proteins were detected qualitatively during comparison of the three species model community with P. gingivalis incubated alone under the same conditions. Integration of spectral counting and summed signal intensity analyses of the dataset showed that 403 proteins were down-regulated and 89 proteins up-regulated. The proteomics results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using DAVID. Significant decreases were seen in proteins involved in cell shape and the formation of the cell envelope, as well as thiamine, cobalamin, and pyrimidine synthesis and DNA repair. An overall increase was seen in proteins involved in protein synthesis. HmuR, a TonB dependent outer membrane receptor, was up-regulated in the community and an hmuR deficient mutant was deficient in three species community formation, but was unimpaired in its ability to form mono- or dual-species biofilms. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results indicate that P. gingivalis can assemble into a heterotypic community with F. nucleatum and S. gordonii, and that a community lifestyle provides physiologic support for P. gingivalis. Proteins such as HmuR, that are up-regulated, can be necessary for community structure.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. Therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. This study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. STUDY DESIGN: DNA extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. Detected taxa included Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), Bacteroidetes clone X083 (26%), Streptococcus species (21%), Olsenella uli (10.5%), Synergistes clone BA121 (10.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), Dialister clone BS016 (5%), Filifactor alocis (5%), Parvimonas micra (5%), and Treponema denticola (5%). Of these, only Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121 were found at levels above 10(5). CONCLUSION: Occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a bacteriocin produced by an oral Fusobacterium nucleatum isolate.
AB  - AIMS: To purify and partially characterize a bacteriocin produced by a Fusobacterium nucleatum strain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following protein precipitation the effect of different treatments on a bacteriocin produced by a F. nucleatum strain named P12.2 isolated from a patient with periodontitis was evaluated. The antagonistic activity of the intracellular fraction obtained at 80% ammonium sulphate was preserved at pH values from 6.0 to 9.0 and showed to be sensitive to high temperatures and to treatment with proteases. The fraction was submitted to sequential steps of gel filtration, ion exchange, and reverse phase chromatography, and SDS-PAGE. Data obtained by mass spectrometry revealed that the molecular mass of the protein was 27,296 Da. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time a bacteriocin produced by a F. nucleatum strain was purified and characterized. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description on characterization of a bacteriocin produced by F. nucleatum. It is possible that the bacteriocin plays a role in the regulation of population levels of periodontopathic organisms.
TI  - Mouse model of experimental periodontitis induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis/Fusobacterium nucleatum infection: bone loss and host response.
AB  - AIM: To compare the effect of oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum versus infection with both bacteria on mouse periodontal tissues, and to characterize the inflammatory response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were orally infected with P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum or both. At 42 days post-infection, alveolar bone loss was quantified using micro-computerized tomography. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta levels induced by the infection were quantified using the subcutaneous chamber model. RESULTS: Mice orally infected with F. nucleatum/P. gingivalis exhibited significantly more bone loss compared with that of mono-infected and sham-infected mice. F. nucleatum/P. gingivalis infection also increased the levels of TNF-alpha and IL1beta compared with the levels found in the mono-infected groups. CONCLUSIONS: Polymicrobial infection with P. gingivalis/F. nucleatum aggravates alveolar bone loss and induces a stronger inflammatory response compared with that observed upon infection with either bacterium alone. The results suggest that oral infection of mice with a mixture of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum may be superior to mono-infection models of experimental periodontitis.
TI  - Polymicrobial infections, biofilms, and beyond.
AB  
TI  - Human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. Viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. Because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. METHODS: Macrophages preinfected with HCMV or EBV were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. Bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. The virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. RESULTS: Both HCMV and EBV significantly diminished the TNF-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. CONCLUSION: Infection by HCMV or EBV inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - Multi-species biofilm formation on dental materials and an adhesive patch.
AB  - PURPOSE: This laboratory study assessed the influence of surface roughness and contact time on the formation of a multi-species biofilm on dental materials (adhesive patch, composite, amalgam and enamel). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rough and smooth specimens of each material were prepared and the mean surface roughness was assessed profilometrically. The biofilms were then allowed to grow either for 15 min or 15 h respectively on saliva-preconditioned specimens of each material, and colony-forming units on blood agar were counted (N = 9/group) Surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: No difference was found in the biofilm formation rate among all the materials that were tested. After a short incubation period, a statistical significant difference between smooth and rough samples could be detected on amalgam and on the resin composite material (P < or = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surface roughness may influence the initial biofilm adherence, but differences vanish following growth and maturation. The multi-species biofilm offers a reliable laboratory model for studying plaque formation.
TI  - TGF-beta1 Inhibits TLR-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  - TGF-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. Odontoblasts extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from TGF-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. This study aimed to determine the role of TGF-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. We show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4 on the cell surface. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum activated both TLRs, but TLR4 played a greater role. Lack of cell-surface TLR2 was associated with poor response to Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus casei. TGF-beta1 inhibited TLR2 and TLR4 expression and attenuated odontoblast responses. Our findings suggest that the balance between TLR-mediated inflammation and TGF-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in pulpal inflammation.
TI  - Decreased interleukin-2 responses to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compromised T-cell responses to periodontal pathogens may contribute  to the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). In this study, we attempted to characterize T-helper cell (Th1, Th2, and Th17) responses in patients with GAgP and healthy controls upon stimulation with disease-relevant pathogens. METHODS: Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from 10 white patients with GAgP and 10 white controls were stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 33277 (Pg), Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 49256 (Fn), and similar bacteria isolated from the participants' inherent oral flora. Tetanus toxoid (TT) was used as control antigen. The resulting production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-2, -4, -5 and -17 and the induced proliferation of CD4+ T cells were measured. RESULTS: MNCs from patients with GAgP exhibited decreased IL-2 responses to Pg and Fn. No difference was observed between patients with GAgP and controls with regard to CD4+ T-cell proliferation or the production of IFN-gamma and IL-4, -5, and -17, irrespective of whether type strains or bacteria isolated from the participants' oral cavity were used for stimulation. Moreover, similar proliferative and cytokine responses to TT were observed. Notably, smoking patients with GAgP exhibited significantly lower IFN-gamma responses to the bacteria and to TT than non-smoking patients or controls. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased IL-2 responses of patients with GAgP to Pg and Fn combined with adequate IL-2 responses to TT suggest an impaired antigen-specific T-cell reactivity with periodontal pathogens in GAgP. The decreased IFN-gamma responses of smokers within the patient group suggest that smoking may aggravate this impairment.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Complementation of the fadA mutation in Fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates that the surface-exposed adhesin promotes cellular invasion and placental colonization.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative oral anaerobe implicated in periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcome. The organism colonizes the mouse placenta, causing localized infection and inflammation. The mechanism of placental colonization has not been elucidated. Previous studies identified a novel adhesin from F. nucleatum, FadA, as being involved in the attachment and invasion of host cells. The fadA deletion mutant F. nucleatum 12230 US1 was defective in host cell attachment and invasion in vitro, but it also exhibited pleiotropic effects with altered cell morphology and growth rate. In this study, a fadA-complementing clone, F. nucleatum 12230 USF81, was constructed. The expression of FadA on USF81 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescent labeling. USF81 restored host cell attachment and invasion activities. The ability of F. nucleatum 12230, US1, and USF81 to colonize the mouse placenta was examined. US1 was severely defective in placental colonization compared to the wild type and USF81. Thus, FadA plays an important role in F. nucleatum colonization in vivo. These results also represent the first complementation studies for F. nucleatum. FadA may be a therapeutic target for preventing F. nucleatum colonization of the host.
TI  - Development of strain-specific PCR primers for the identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme ATCC 51190(T) and subsp. vincentii ATCC 49256(T).
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop the strain-specific PCR primers for Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme ATCC 51190(T) and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii ATCC 49256(T) based on the nucleotide sequence of the Fs17 and Fv35 DNA probes, respectively. The strain specificity was tested against 10 type strains of Fusobacterium spp. or subsp., 21 clinical isolates of F. nucleatum from Koreans, and five type strains of distinct Fusobacterium species. Primer sensitivity was determined by testing serial dilutions (4 ng-4 fg) of the purified genomic DNA from each of the type strains. PCR showed that two pairs of PCR primers, Fs17-F14/Fs17-R14 and Fv35-F1/Fv35-R1 primers, could produce strain-specific amplicons from F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme ATCC 51190(T) and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii ATCC 49256(T), respectively. The two PCR primer sets could detect as little as 0.4 pg or 4 pg of the genomic DNA of each target strain. These results suggest that the two sets of PCR primers could be used to identify F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme ATCC 51190(T) and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii ATCC 49256(T), particularly for ascertaining the authenticity of the strain.
TI  - The OxyR homologue in Tannerella forsythia regulates expression of oxidative stress responses and biofilm formation.
AB  - Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic periodontal pathogen that encounters constant oxidative stress in the human oral cavity due to exposure to air and reactive oxidative species from coexisting dental plaque bacteria as well as leukocytes. In this study, we sought to characterize a T. forsythia ORF with close similarity to bacterial oxidative stress response sensor protein OxyR. To analyse the role of this OxyR homologue, a gene deletion mutant was constructed and characterized. Aerotolerance, survival after hydrogen peroxide challenge and transcription levels of known bacterial antioxidant genes were then determined. Since an association between oxidative stress and biofilm formation has been observed in bacterial systems, we also investigated the role of the OxyR protein in biofilm development by T. forsythia. Our results showed that aerotolerance, sensitivity to peroxide challenge and the expression of oxidative stress response genes were significantly reduced in the mutant as compared with the wild-type strain. Moreover, the results of biofilm analyses showed that, as compared with the wild-type strain, the oxyR mutant showed significantly less autoaggregation and a reduced ability to form mixed biofilms with Fusobacterium nucleatum. In conclusion, a gene annotated in the T. forsythia genome as an oxyR homologue was characterized. Our studies showed that the oxyR homologue in T. forsythia constitutively activates antioxidant genes involved in resistance to peroxides as well as oxygen stress (aerotolerance). In addition, the oxyR deletion attenuates biofilm formation in T. forsythia.
TI  - Are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  - Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. A number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. In the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (CP) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (PR) (n = 21). The control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. A total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. The samples were analyzed by PCR of 16S rRNA gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, a Treponema denticola-like phylogroup (Treponema phylogroup II), Treponema lecithinolyticum, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium spp., and Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as Capnocytophaga ochracea. Our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. However, these species were also frequently detected in the PR group. For most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. T. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between GAP and CP patients and between GAP patients and PR subjects. C. ochracea was associated with the PR subjects, regardless of the probing depth. These results indicate that T. lecithinolyticum may be a diagnostic marker for GAP and C. ochracea for periodontal health. They also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.
TI  - Evidence for pseudoknot formation of class I preQ1 riboswitch aptamers.
AB  - All in a knot. The smallest riboswitch forms a pseudoknot in solution. This is demonstrated for preQ(1) class I aptamers by mutational analysis in combination with (1)H NMR-based structure probing. How pseudoknot formation mediates the mRNA response through its expression platform is now open for investigation.
TI  - Bacterial culture and DNA Checkerboard for the detection of internal contamination in dental implants.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface by the conventional bacterial culture and DNA Checkerboard hybridization method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty Branemark-compatible implants with a 3.75-mm diameter and external hexagonal platform were randomly placed in two groups of ten implant-abutment assemblies each. One group was used to analyze bacterial counts by DNA Checkerboard hybridization and the other by a conventional bacterial culture. Suspensions of Fusobacterium nucleatum (3 microl) were injected into the grooved internal cylinders of each implant assembly, and the abutment was connected by a 32 Ncm torque. The combined implant-abutments were individually placed in tubes containing the CaSaB culture medium and incubated in a bacteriological constant temperature oven for 14 days. The samples were observed daily as to the presence of turbidity, and after the designated time the microorganisms were collected from the implant interiors and analyzed by the two methods. RESULTS: After 14 days, six implant-abutment assemblies showed turbidity. Both methods indicated reduced microorganism counts in samples from the interior of the implant-abutment assemblies after incubation in the culture medium; however, the number of counts of F. nucleatum was higher by the DNA Checkerboard method when compared to the group analyzed by conventional bacterial cultures (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The DNA Checkerboard method was shown to be more sensitive than conventional cultures in the detection of microorganisms.
TI  - Characterization of the complex bacterial communities colonizing biliary stents reveals a host-dependent diversity.
AB  - This study provides a comprehensive survey of the spatial and temporal bacterial  composition of biliary stent biofilms. The bacterial diversity, distribution and dynamics of 59 biliary and 4 pancreatic stent communities from 40 patients being treated at two different hospitals, which implant stents either simultaneously or consecutively, were characterized by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Fifty-one phylotypes belonging to 5 bacterial phyla and 24 bacterial families were detected across 63 stents. This is a much broader diversity than previously detected through culture-dependent methods, particularly in regard to the diversity of obligate anaerobes. Stent bacterial diversity was patient-dependent and more similar when stents were implanted simultaneously rather than consecutively. Stent bacterial community composition differed between hospitals specifically because of the difference in abundance of Bifidobacteria. Co-colonization of Veillonella sp., Streptococcus anginosus and organisms closely related to Fusobacterium nucleatum revealed a potentially important attachment and survival strategy that has yet to be reported in biliary stents. This work reveals a more complete survey of the identities of bacterial species that form biofilms in biliary stents, their co-colonization patterns and the natural variation in species composition between different patients, hospitals and locations along the stent. Consideration of the community composition from individual patients will allow tailoring of prophylactic antibiotic treatments and thus will make the management of stent biofilms more effective.
TI  - TLR2 sensing of F. nucleatum and S. sanguinis distinctly triggered gingival innate response.
AB  - Gingival tissue faces constant exposure to micro-organisms. It functions as part  of the host response, an anti-microbial barrier that recognizes and discriminates between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of cell wall extracts from different periodontal bacteria, commensals Streptococcus sanguinis and Fusobacterium nucleatum and the pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, on the innate immune response of gingival keratinocytes and the role of TLR2 in regulating this. We assayed mRNA levels to determine the expression of human beta-defensins (hbetaD2, hbetaD3), interleukin-1alpha, -1beta, 6 and 8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. F. nucleatum extracts induced beta-defensin and inflammatory marker mRNA expression at higher levels than P. gingivalis. Extracts from the Gram-positive commensal S. sanguinis did not upregulate the host response. TLR2 extinction inhibited the upregulation of beta-defensin and cytokine transcripts by F. nucleatum extracts but, in contrast, led to a weak induction of hbetaD3 after challenge with S. sanguinis extracts. Although F. nucleatum strongly induces innate immune and inflammatory mediators, S. sanguinis limits their expression through TLR2. Together, our data demonstrate that gingival keratinocytes recognize and discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative commensal extracts, in part through TLR2, to activate different signaling pathways of the innate immune host response.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 requires Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 43146 for growth on saliva in a three-species community that includes Streptococcus oralis 34.
AB  - Formation of dental plaque is a developmental process involving initial and late  colonizing species that form polymicrobial communities. Fusobacteria are the most numerous gram-negative bacteria in dental plaque, but they become prevalent after the initial commensal colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces, have established communities. The unusual ability of these bacteria to coaggregate with commensals, as well as pathogenic late colonizers, has been proposed to facilitate colonization by the latter organisms. We investigated the integration of Fusobacterium nucleatum into multispecies communities by employing two in vitro models with saliva as the sole nutritional source. In flow cell biofilms, numbers of cells were quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilms were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) using species-specific primers. Unable to grow as single-species biofilms, F. nucleatum grew in two-species biofilms with Actinomyces naeslundii but not with Streptococcus oralis. However, enhanced growth of fusobacteria was observed in three-species biofilms, indicating that there was multispecies cooperation. Importantly, these community dynamics yielded an 18-fold increase in the F. nucleatum biomass between 4 h and 18 h in the flow cell inoculated with three species. q-PCR analysis of static biofilms revealed that maximum growth of the three species occurred at 24 h to 36 h. Lower numbers of cells were observed at 48 h, suggesting that saliva could not support higher cell densities as the sole nutrient. Integration of F. nucleatum into multispecies commensal communities was evident from the interdigitation of fusobacteria in coaggregates with A. naeslundii and S. oralis and from the improved growth of fusobacteria, which was dependent on the presence of A. naeslundii.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  - The plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. A quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus oralis (P <0.05) and of Porphyromonas gingivalis and S. oralis. Amylase significantly (P <0.05) increased the coaggregation of A. naeslundii versus Fusobacterium nucleatum and A. naeslundii versus P. gingivalis. Concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). Similar dosing and analysis of multiple Sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. A short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. Whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. In summary, although hydrolytic enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. In contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on experimental periodontitis in the mouse.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is an infective disease caused predominantly by gram-negative anerobes. The host inflammatory response to these bacteria causes alveolar bone loss, which characterizes periodontitis. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have recognized anti-inflammatory effects; their oxygenated derivatives are key mediators in reducing inflammation. In this study we tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with tuna fish oil rich in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, would reduce alveolar bone loss in mice inoculated with periodontopathic bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult mice were fed experimental diets containing either 10% tuna oil or Sunola oil for 57 d. After 14 d, 35 mice on each diet were inoculated orally with Porphyromonas gingivalis, with a mixture of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with carboxymethylcellulose or remained untreated. The mice were killed, and soft tissue biopsies from the oral cavity of treated mice were used to determine the polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. The maxilla was removed, stained and digitally imaged to assess bone loss around the upper molars. RESULTS: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were significantly higher in oral soft tissues of mice fed tuna oil compared with the control group. Mice fed tuna oil and inoculated with P. gingivalis or with the combination of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis exhibited 72% and 54% less alveolar bone loss respectively, compared with the treatment control group. CONCLUSION: Alveolar bone loss was inversely related to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid tissue levels. In conclusion, fish oil dietary supplementation may have potential benefits as a host modulatory agent in the prevention and/or adjunctive management of periodontitis.
TI  - Effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biofilms of six bacterial species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs according to the Zurich Biofilm Model. Xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. At the end of their designated incubation times, some HA discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. Aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific media. After a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C, the colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. RESULTS: CLSM images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of HA discs. Culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. This study shows that xylitol is not only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.
TI  - Endodontic microorganism susceptibility by direct contact test.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the duration of the antimicrobial  effect of endodontic sealers by means of the Direct Contact Test. The sealers tested were: Endomethasone - Septodont, Endomethasone C-Septodont, Endion-Voco, Diaket-ESPE, Pulp Canal Sealer-SybronEndo, and AH26-Dentsply DeTrey. The endodontopathic microorganisms (MO) confronted were: Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Candida albicans (Ca), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). Test specimens of each sealer were prepared and placed on the surface of agar plates that had been inoculated with each MO, and after predetermined periods, transfers were made from the contact area between the test specimen and the cultured agar and from the area that had not been in contact with the test specimens (control). The results were read as presence/absence of microbial growth and analyzed statistically using the Kruskal-Wallis test. It was concluded that the structural features and virulence of endodontopathic microorganisms determine their response to the sealers, independently of the time during which sealers act and the mechanism by which the antiseptic reaches the microorganism, which in this case was by direct contact.
TI  - Coenzyme recognition and gene regulation by a flavin mononucleotide riboswitch.
AB  - The biosynthesis of several protein cofactors is subject to feedback regulation by riboswitches. Flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-specific riboswitches, also known as RFN elements, direct expression of bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) and related compounds. Here we present the crystal structures of the Fusobacterium nucleatum riboswitch bound to FMN, riboflavin and antibiotic roseoflavin. The FMN riboswitch structure, centred on an FMN-bound six-stem junction, does not fold by collinear stacking of adjacent helices, typical for folding of large RNAs. Rather, it adopts a butterfly-like scaffold, stapled together by opposingly directed but nearly identically folded peripheral domains. FMN is positioned asymmetrically within the junctional site and is specifically bound to RNA through interactions with the isoalloxazine ring chromophore and direct and Mg(2+)-mediated contacts with the phosphate moiety. Our structural data, complemented by binding and footprinting experiments, imply a largely pre-folded tertiary RNA architecture and FMN recognition mediated by conformational transitions within the junctional binding pocket. The inherent plasticity of the FMN-binding pocket and the availability of large openings make the riboswitch an attractive target for structure-based design of FMN-like antimicrobial compounds. Our studies also explain the effects of spontaneous and antibiotic-induced deregulatory mutations and provided molecular insights into FMN-based control of gene expression in normal and riboflavin-overproducing bacterial strains.
TI  - New bacterial compositions in root-filled teeth with periradicular lesions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and detect microorganisms of root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions. Specimens were sampled from patients undergoing root canal retreatment. The bacteria were characterized by morphologic and biochemical analysis and by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microorganisms were detected in 10 of 18 teeth. The majority of positive samples revealed a mixed culture of 2-8 species. In 2 teeth Enterococcus faecalis was the only detected species. For the first time Vagococcus fluvialis was detected in root canals. Solobacterium moorei and Fusobacterium nucleatum were the most prevalent species. Presence of F. nucleatum was associated with the presence of S. moorei in 5 of 7 cases. In all teeth with Parvimonas micra and Dialister invisus, F. nucleatum and S. moorei were found. Moreover, members of additional different genera were detected delivering bacterial compositions that have been not described yet.
TI  - A novel vaccine targeting Fusobacterium nucleatum against abscesses and halitosis.
AB  - An abscess in a gum pocket, resulting from bacterial infection, is a common source of chronic halitosis. Although antibiotics are generally prescribed for abscesses, they require multiple treatments with risks of creating resistant bacterial strains. Here we develop a novel vaccine using ultraviolet-inactivated Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), a representative oral bacterium for halitosis. A gum pocket model, established by continuous inoculation of F. nucleatum, was employed to validate the vaccine potency. Mice immunized with inactivated F. nucleatum effectively minimized the progression of abscesses, measured by swollen tissues of gum pockets. Most notably, the immunized mice were capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the production of volatile sulfur compounds of F. nucleatum. The novel vaccine inducing protective immunity provides an alternative option to conventional antibiotic treatments for chronic halitosis associated with abscesses.
TI  - [Bacteriological analysis of subgingival plaque in adolescents].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in characteristics of periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with puberty gingivitis and its relevance with clinical symptoms. METHODS: A total of 108 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 30 patients with puberty gingivitis (Group G), 9 cases of chronic periodontitis (Group P) and 15 healthy controls (Group H). The age of the 54 participants was from 11 to 17. The black-pigmented bacteria (BPB), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Actinomyces were detected using bacterial culture. The probing depth (PD), gingival index (GI), bleeding index (BI) and attachment loss (AL) were also recorded. RESULTS: In all these three groups, the detection rates of black-pigmented bacteria were: 3%, 30% and 100%; Fn were: 30%, 68% and 94%, statistically significantly different (P < 0.01). The lgCFU/ml of black-pigmented bacteria and Actinomyces was higher in mild-moderate group [(3.8 +/- 0.7) and (5.3 +/- 0.9)] than in Group H (P < 0.001). The lgCFU/ml of black-pigmented bacteria and Fn significantly was higher in severe inflammation group [(4.7 +/- 1.2) and (4.4 +/- 0.8)] than in the mild-moderate group (P < 0.01). The lgCFU/ml of black-pigmented bacteria, Fn and Aa was higher in severe gingivitis group [(6.6 +/- 1.0), (5.5 +/- 1.0) and (4.2 +/- 1.7)] than in mild gingivitis group (P < 0.01). The detection rate and lgCFU/ml of black-pigmented bacteria, Fn and Aa were both positively correlated with BI, PD and AL. CONCLUSIONS: In the stage of severe gingivitis, the periodontal pathogens increased markedly, suggesting that risk of further destruction of periodontal tissue may exist.
TI  - Intracellular replication of fusobacteria requires new actin filament formation of epithelial cells.
AB  - We examined survival and replication of fusobacteria inside epithelial cells. Subconfluent cultures of HaCaT keratinocytes were infected with five bacterial strains representing three Fusobacterium species: F. nucleatum, F. necrophorum, and F. mortiferum. Adhesion and invasion of the bacteria were assayed before and after antibiotic treatment that killed the adhered and extracellular bacteria. The number of live fusobacteria was examined by bacterial culturing after sonication of the epithelial cells. The role of host cell cytoskeleton functions was examined by treating the epithelial cells with cell function inhibitors. Number of viable epithelial cells was measured with the CellTiter96 kit. The tested Fusobacterium species adhered to and invaded the epithelial cells, and multiplied intracellularly for several hours. Thereafter, the intracellular number of bacteria rapidly declined. Concomitantly, viable fusobacteria were detected in the culture medium. Treatment of the infected epithelial cells with an actin formation inhibitor markedly reduced the number of living intracellular fusobacteria. Newly formed actin filaments were seen by confocal microscopy in the epithelial cells associated with the invaded bacteria. Fusobacteria infection did not reduce the number of viable epithelial cells in culture. Thus, fusobacteria are able to adhere to and invade epithelial cells, and survive under aerobic conditions. This property may enable them to survive in mucosa and participate in various disease processes of oral and pharyngeal tissues.
TI  - The microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  - As the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. We hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. Abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. Other frequently found taxa included Olsenella uli, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121), and newly named species (Prevotella baroniae and Dialister invisus). Several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. Findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - Short-term clinical and microbiological evaluations of peri-implant diseases before and after mechanical anti-infective therapies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of mechanical anti-infective therapies for mucositis and peri-implantitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects with at least one dental implant were assigned to healthy (n=10), mucositis (n=12) or peri-implantitis (n=13) groups. Implants with mucositis or peri-implantitis were decontaminated by means of teflon curettes and abrasive sodium carbonate air-powder, performed by an open flap for peri-implantitis and without surgery for mucositis. Visible plaque (PI), marginal bleeding (MB), bleeding on probing (BOP), suppuration (SUP), probing depth (PD) and relative clinical attachment level (rCAL) were assessed at baseline and at 3 months after therapies. At the same time points, submucosal plaque samples were collected from each implant and analyzed by Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 bacterial species. RESULTS: All clinical parameters improved at 3 months post-therapy in mucositis and peri-implantitis groups (P<0.05). The mean reduction in rCAL (+/-SD) was 1.4+/-1.2 mm and 2.3+/-1.6 mm, and it was 1.3+/-1.2 mm and 3.1+/-1.7 mm in PD (+/-SD) for mucositis and peri-implantitis, respectively. Levels of Treponema denticola, Tanerella forsythia and Parvimonas micra, and of Fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, were significantly reduced after peri-implantitis therapy and after mucositis therapy, respectively (P<0.05). In addition, counts of Porphyromons gingivalis, Treponema socranskii and the proportions of red complex were reduced in both groups at 3 months after treatments (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Mechanical therapies alone were effective in treating mucositis and peri-implantitis over a period of 3 months. The open debridement procedure showed clinical and microbiological benefits on the treatment of peri-implantitis and could be safely used as a standard control group for future studies.
TI  - Periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. METHODS: DNA gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of 8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. The 8 pathogens examined were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (AA), Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), Prevotella intermedia (PI), Tannerella forsythia (TF), Eikenella corrodens (EC), Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN), Treponema denticola (TD), and Campylobacter rectus (CR). Chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. Logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. RESULTS: For 6 (PI, TF, EC, FN, TD, CR) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. No pathogen level was significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (EC, FN, TD, CR) posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of clinical Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium periodonticum isolates from the human gut.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic rod that is part of the normal human microflora, and has also been associated with various infections. Bacterial strains belonging to the species are typically heterogeneous in both phenotype and genotype, which can hinder their identification in a clinical setting. The majority of F. nucleatum isolates originate from oral sites, however the species is also a resident of the human gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to compare F. nucleatum isolates from human intestinal biopsy samples to try and determine whether isolates from this site are divergent from oral isolates. We used a variety of phenotypic and genotypic markers to compare 21 F. nucleatum and Fusobacterium periodonticum isolates from the GI tract to oral isolates and recognized type strains in order to study heterogeneity within this set. 16S rDNA and rpoB gene sequence analysis allowed us to build phylogenetic trees that consistently placed isolates into distinct clusters. 16S rDNA copy number analyses using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) demonstrated potential for use as a method to examine clonality amongst species. Phenotypic analyses gave variable results that were generally unhelpful in distinguishing between phylogenetic clusters. Our results suggest that a) F. periodonticum isolates are not restricted to the oral niche; b) phenotypic classification is not sufficient to subspeciate isolates; c) heterogeneity within the species is extensive but constrained; and d) F. nucleatum isolates from the gut tend to identify with the animalis subspecies.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 2 and NALP2 mediate induction of human beta-defensins by fusobacterium nucleatum in gingival epithelial cells.
AB  - We previously reported that infection by Fusobacterium nucleatum strongly induced the expression of both human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) and HBD-3 by gingival epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to characterize the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and regulatory mechanisms involved in the induction of HBD-2 and -3 expression by F. nucleatum in gingival epithelial cells. Immortalized human gingival epithelial HOK-16B cells were infected with live or heat-killed F. nucleatum, and the expression of HBDs and interleukin-8 (IL-8) was examined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Live, but not heat-killed, F. nucleatum invaded HOK-16B cells, as seen by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Live F. nucleatum induced both HBD-2 and -3 efficiently, whereas heat-killed bacteria induced only HBD-3 at a reduced level. Knockdown of NACHT-LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 2 (NALP2), the most abundant intracellular PRR in HOK-16B cells, by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly reduced the induction of HBD-3 but not HBD-2 and IL-8. In addition, knockdown of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by RNAi reduced the upregulation of HBD-2 and -3 but not IL-8. Heat-killed F. nucleatum was hindered in its ability to activate TLR2 and JNK signaling pathways. Theses data show that TLR2 and NALP2 mediate the induction of HBDs by F. nucleatum in gingival epithelial cells, but thresholds for the two HBD genes are different.
TI  - [Detection of periodontal pathogenic bacteria DNA in coronary atheromatous plaques from patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to observe the coexistence of periodontal bacteria DNA (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella. forsythensis) in coronary atheromatous plaques and subgingival plaques in patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft. METHODS: Coronary atheromatous plaque and subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 51 patients and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with specific primers for periodontal bacteria. RESULTS: P. gingivalis (33%), T. forsythensis (31%), P. intermedia (18%) and F. nucleatum (12%) were detected while A. actinomycetemcomitans was negative and not found in coronary atheromatous plaques; T. forsythensis (84%), F. nucleatum (78%), P. intermedia (59%), P. gingivalis (39%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (22%) were detected in subgingival plaque samples. Coexistence of periodontal bacteria DNA in coronary atheromatous and subgingival plaque samples was evidenced in 32 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of T. forsythensis, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, P. gingivalis in coronary atheromatous plaques and the subgingival plaque samples in CAD patients could suggest a potential role for periodontal pathogenic bacteria in atherosclerosis disease process.
TI  - Tinidazole inhibitory and cidal activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tinidazole against anaerobic periodontal pathogens (25 Prevotella buccae, 18 Prevotella denticola, 10 Prevotella intermedia, 6 Prevotella melaninogenica, 5 Prevotella oralis, 10 Fusobacterium nucleatum and 8 Veillonella spp.) was determined by agar dilution. MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were 8 microg/mL for Veillonella spp., 4 microg/mL for P. intermedia, 2 microg/mL for P. buccae, 1 microg/mL for Fusobacterium spp. and 0.5 microg/mL for other Prevotella spp. Cidal activity was studied by killing curves with tinidazole and amoxicillin (alone and in combination) at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid (41.2 microg/mL tinidazole and 14.05 microg/mL amoxicillin) against an inoculum of ca. 10(7)colony-forming units/mL of four bacterial groups, each one composed of four different strains of the following periodontal isolates: Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Veillonella spp. (anaerobes) and one amoxicillin-susceptible Streptococcus spp. (facultative) in a proportion of 1:1:1:1. When only beta-lactamase-negative Prevotella or Fusobacterium strains were tested, significantly higher reductions were found with amoxicillin (>4 log reduction at 48 h) versus controls. The presence of beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella spp. or F. nucleatum strains rendered amoxicillin inactive (no reductions at 48 h), with no differences from controls. Amoxicillin+tinidazole produced >3 log reduction at 24h and >4 log reduction at 48 h regardless of the presence or not of beta-lactamase-positive strains. The presence in crevicular fluid of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactamase-positive periodontal pathogens may have ecological and therapeutic consequences since it may protect beta-lactamase-negative periodontal pathogens from amoxicillin treatment. In vitro, tinidazole offered high antianaerobic activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative periodontal pathogens, avoiding amoxicillin inactivation.
TI  - Proteolytic Activities of Oral Bacteria on ProMMP-9 and the Effect of Synthetic Proteinase Inhibitors.
AB  - Tissue reactions to bacteria lead to proinflammatory reactions involving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Synthetic protease inhibitors may offer new possibilities to regulate bacterial proteases. We investigated proteolytic activities of certain periodontal bacteria, their effects on the latent proMMP-9, and the effects of synthetic MMP inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc. The strains studied were Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptoccus micros, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. Their gelatinolytic activities and the effects of certain synthetic MMP inhibitors and Pefabloc were analyzed by zymography. Bacterial effects on proMMP-9 conversion were investigated by Western immunoblot. All investigated periodontal bacteria produced gelatinolytic cell-bound and extracellular proteinases which could fragment latent proMMP-9, suggesting co-operative processing cascades in oral tissue remodeling. A. actinomycetemcomitans produced the weakest gelatinolytic activity. Synthetic proteinase inhibitors exhibited slight but clear reductive effects on the bacterial proteolytic activities. We conclude that targeted anti-proteolytic treatment modalities against bacterial-host proteolytic cascades can be developed.
TI  - Synergistic pathogenicity of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in the mouse subcutaneous chamber model.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum are often coisolated from sites of infection, such as suppurative apical periodontitis. The synergistic pathogenicity of mixed infection of P. gingivalis HG 405 with F. nucleatum PK 1594 was studied in the mouse subcutaneous chamber model in groups of seven animals. The minimal dose for P. gingivalis HG 405 that was required to infect 100% of the chambers was reduced by 1,000-fold when animals were inoculated in the same chamber with 1 x 10(9)F. nucleatum PK 1594 (p < 0.001). To benefit from the presence of the fusobacteria, P. gingivalis HG 405 had to be coinoculated; inoculation in separate chambers for the same animal had no such effect (p < 0.001). Subinfective F. nucleatum inocula also benefited from the association with P. gingivalis HG 405 and uniformly established an infection when this partner was present (p < 0.001). These results suggest that the frequent and natural coexistence of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum in diseased sites may express such a synergism in successful establishment and survival of small inocula.
TI  - Enhanced attachment of Porphyromonas gingivalis to human fibroblasts mediated by  Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis are often co-isolated from endodontic infection sites. The present study tested the hypothesis that adhesin-mediated reactions might contribute to this phenomenon. F. nucleaum PK1594 and P. gingivalis PK1924 were selectively labeled with fluorochromes and allowed to adhere to human fibroblasts, either each strain alone or sequentially. The number of bacteria of each type adhering to individual fibroblasts was determined. Sugar inhibition profile of this adherence was explored. Attachment of P. gingivalis to human fibroblasts increased by nearly 10-fold when F. nucleatum was present (P < .001). Galactose, lactose, and fucose inhibited this enhanced attachment (P < .001), as well as that of F. nucleatum alone (P < .001). The results suggest that F. nucleatum might be a primary colonizer of the host tissues and serve as mediator for enhanced attachment of P. gingivalis to the host cells. This might explain in part the common co-occurrence of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis in endodontic mixed infections.
TI  - Characterization of coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 with six Porphyromonas gingivalis strains.
AB  - Coaggregation is a key mechanism in biofilm formation. The aim of this study was  to characterize the coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 with six Porphyromonas gingivalis strains in terms of kinetics and sugars inhibition. This coaggregation was quantitatively characterized by using a kinetic coaggregation assay. Sugar inhibition profiles were also quantitatively defined. Four types of interactions among these coaggregation partners were found: (1) fast coaggregation that was substantially inhibited by galactose, lactose, and fucose (strain PK1924); (2) fast coaggregation that was not inhibited by any of the sugars tested (strain 274); (3) slow coaggregation that was either substantially or partially inhibited by the sugars mentioned (strains HG405 and W50, respectively); and (4) strains that did not coaggregate with the fusobacteria (ATCC33277 and A7436). These results suggest that adhesin(s) other than the well-known galactose-mediated ones may be involved in coaggregation between F. nucleatum PK1594 and P. gingivalis strains.
TI  - Coaggregation of Treponema denticola with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum is mediated by the major outer sheath protein of Treponema denticola.
AB  - Coagreggation of Treponema denticola with either Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum was characterized and the role of the major outer sheath protein (MSP) in the coaggregation process of these bacteria was evaluated. The MSP of T. denticola was found to be able to bind to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum cells and this binding could be inhibited by MSP in a concentration-dependent manner. While sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of MSP revealed that it is a glycoprotein, monosaccharide analysis showed that MSP contains: Glc (44.4), Gal (20.4%) GlcN (1.3%), GalN (31.6%) and Fuc (9.2%). Peptide N-glycosidase F deglycosylation of MSP was found to inhibit its binding to F. nucleatum but not to P. gingivalis cells. Sugar-binding studies showed that the requirements for the binding of both T. denticola and MSP to F. nucleatum cells are similar to those of the F. nucleatum galactose-binding lectin. These data suggest that MSP acts as an adhesin during the coaggregation process of T. denticola with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum through its protein and carbohydrate moieties, respectively.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum enhances invasion of human gingival epithelial and aortic endothelial cells by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Invasion by Porphyromonas gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. Porphyromonas gingivalis have direct access to the systemic circulation and endothelium in periodontitis patients by transient bacteremia. Periodontitis can be described as one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans. In the present study, P. gingivalis strains were tested for their ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line (Ca9-22) and human aortic endothelial cells in coinfection with Fusobacterium nucleatum using antibiotic protection assays. Coinfection with F. nucleatum resulted in 2-20-fold increase in the invasion of host cells by P. gingivalis strains. The invasive abilities of P. gingivalis strains were significantly greater when incubated with a F. nucleatum clinical isolate (which possesses strong biofilm-forming ability), than when incubated with a F. nucleatum-type strain. In inhibition assays with metabolic inhibitors, a difference in inhibition profiles was observed between mono- and polymicrobial infections. Collectively, our results suggest that F. nucleatum facilitates invasion of host cells by P. gingivalis. Investigations of polymicrobial infection of host cells should improve our understanding of the role of P. gingivalis in periodontal infection and proatherogenic mechanisms.
TI  - Oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in HEp-2 cells by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. P. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. The failure of host defenses to eliminate P. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in P. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. There is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. An in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on P. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. Oral pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of P. aeruginosa into HEp-2 cells from one- to threefold. In contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on P. aeruginosa invasion. P. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from HEp-2 cells than did P. aeruginosa alone. P. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of HEp-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. These results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster P. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.
TI  - Frequency, microbial interactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum isolated from primary endodontic infections.
AB  - This study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a Brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the E-test. One hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. Five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. F. nucleatum was found in 38 root canals and was associated with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., and Eubacterium spp. F. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with Peptostreptococcus prevotii. The simultaneous presence of F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). They were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. Fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. Amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in Brazil.
TI  - The Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane protein RadD is an arginine-inhibitable adhesin required for inter-species adherence and the structured architecture of multispecies biofilm.
AB  - A defining characteristic of the suspected periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum is its ability to adhere to a plethora of oral bacteria. This distinguishing feature is suggested to play an important role in oral biofilm formation and pathogenesis, with fusobacteria proposed to serve as central 'bridging organisms' in the architecture of the oral biofilm bringing together species which would not interact otherwise. Previous studies indicate that these bacterial interactions are mediated by galactose- or arginine-inhibitable adhesins although genetic evidence for the role and nature of these proposed adhesins remains elusive. To characterize these adhesins at the molecular level, the genetically transformable F. nucleatum strain ATCC 23726 was screened for adherence properties, and arginine-inhibitable adhesion was evident, while galactose-inhibitable adhesion was not detected. Six potential arginine-binding proteins were isolated from the membrane fraction of F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 and identified via mass spectroscopy as members of the outer membrane family of proteins in F. nucleatum. Inactivation of the genes encoding these six candidates for arginine-inhibitable adhesion and two additional homologues revealed that only a mutant derivative carrying an insertion in Fn1526 (now designated as radD) demonstrated significantly decreased co-aggregation with representatives of the gram-positive 'early oral colonizers'. Lack of the 350 kDa outer membrane protein encoded by radD resulted in the failure to form the extensive structured biofilm observed with the parent strain when grown in the presence of Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556. These findings indicate that radD is responsible for arginine-inhibitable adherence of F. nucleatum and provides definitive molecular evidence that F. nucleatum adhesins play a vital role in inter-species adherence and multispecies biofilm formation.
TI  - Naturally occurring phenolic antibacterial compounds show effectiveness against oral bacteria by a quantitative structure-activity relationship study.
AB  - Natural and synthetic phenolic compounds were evaluated against oral bacteria. A  quantitative structure-active relationship approach was applied to the germ-kill activity for a range of phenolic compounds. The lipophilicity and steric effects were found to be two key factors in determining germ-kill activity. The optimum lipophilicity, measured by the logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient, or log P, was found to be 5.5 for Fusobacterium nucleatum , a Gram-negative type of oral bacteria that causes bad breath. The optimum log P was found to be 7.9 for Streptococcus mutans , a Gram-positive type of oral bacteria that causes tooth decay. The steric effect of substituents ortho to the phenolic group was found to be critical in reducing antibacterial activity despite having increased lipid solubility approaching the optimum lipophilicity value. The antibacterial activity of phenolic compounds is likely exerted by multiple functions, primarily comes from its ability to act as a nonionic surface-active agent therefore disrupting the lipid-protein interface.
TI  - Crystal structure of FadA adhesin from Fusobacterium nucleatum reveals a novel oligomerization motif, the leucine chain.
AB  - Many bacterial appendages have filamentous structures, often composed of repeating monomers assembled in a head-to-tail manner. The mechanisms of such linkages vary. We report here a novel protein oligomerization motif identified in the FadA adhesin from the Gram-negative bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 2.0 angstroms crystal structure of the secreted form of FadA (mFadA) reveals two antiparallel alpha-helices connected by an intervening 8-residue hairpin loop. Leucine-leucine contacts play a prominent dual intra- and intermolecular role in the structure and function of FadA. First, they comprise the main association between the two helical arms of the monomer; second, they mediate the head-to-tail association of monomers to form the elongated polymers. This leucine-mediated filamentous assembly of FadA molecules constitutes a novel structural motif termed the "leucine chain." The essential role of these residues in FadA is corroborated by mutagenesis of selected leucine residues, which leads to the abrogation of oligomerization, filament formation, and binding to host cells.
TI  - Factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. I. Plaque mass.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. This study was designed to examine the relationship between total DNA probe counts of supragingival biofilm samples, clinical parameters and supragingival biofilm composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 187 systemically healthy adult subjects (n = 4745 samples). All samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The relationship between total DNA probe counts and microbial composition was examined by subsetting the data into 10 groups based on 10 percentile increments of the total DNA probe counts. Differences among groups in terms of species counts and proportions were sought, as well as relationships of total plaque DNA probe count and clinical parameters. RESULTS: There was a wide distribution in mean total DNA probe counts among the 187 subjects. With increasing total plaque levels there was a change in the proportions of individual species and microbial complexes. 'Small plaques' were characterized by high proportions of species in the yellow, orange, purple and 'other' complexes; plaques of moderate mass were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces and purple complex species, while 'large plaques' exhibited increased proportions of green and orange complex species. Measures of gingival inflammation, pocket depth and recession were significantly positively associated with total DNA probe counts. Increased plaque numbers were related to increased pocket depth irrespective of presence or absence of gingival inflammation. CONCLUSION: The proportions of individual species and microbial complexes in supragingival biofilms are influenced by the total numbers of organisms in the biofilm.
TI  - Uncultivated bacteria as etiologic agents of intra-amniotic inflammation leading  to preterm birth.
AB  - Intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (PTB). However, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. This may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. In this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with PTB were examined by both culture and 16S rRNA-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by PTB and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. No bacterial DNA was amplified in AF collected from the asymptomatic women. Among the 46 samples associated with PTB, bacterial DNA was amplified from all (16/16) of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. In the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by PCR and clone analysis. Altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. They included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) spp., a Bergeyella sp., a Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides spp., and a species of the order Clostridiales. To examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an AF proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but PCR positive. Women who were PCR positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their AF, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. Previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of PTB.
TI  - Participation of glutathione in the elimination of Porphyromonas gingivalis in vivo.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glutathione is involved in immune responses such as cell proliferation and bactericidal activity. The aim of this study was to see whether glutathione influences the intraperitoneal elimination of Porphyromonas gingivalis in Fusobacterium nucleatum-immunized mice. METHODS: Mice were immunized with P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum, and then P. gingivalis was inoculated into the peritoneal cavity of the mice. After various lengths of time, the numbers of bacteria were determined by a colony-forming assay and by polymerase chain reaction. The effect of glutathione on the elimination of P. gingivalis was explored by changing the intracellular glutathione level. Furthermore, we examined the effects of glutathione on the peritoneal levels of interferon-gamma, a macrophage activator, and of nitrite, a derivative of nitric oxide that acts as an antimicrobial agent when produced by macrophages and neutrophils. RESULTS: Inoculated P. gingivalis was eliminated more rapidly from F. nucleatum-immunized mice than from P. gingivalis-immunized mice. Interferon-gamma levels in peritoneal lavage fluid and glutathione levels in peritoneal exudate cells were higher in F. nucleatum-immunized mice than in P. gingivalis-immunized mice. When P. gingivalis-immunized mice were given glutathione monoethylester (a derivative of glutathione that is converted to glutathione intracellularly through hydrolysis) into the peritoneal cavity, the elimination of P. gingivalis was accelerated. On the other hand, when F. nucleatum-immunized mice were given L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis) into the peritoneal cavity, the elimination of P. gingivalis was suppressed. CONCLUSION: In F. nucleatum-immunized mice, glutathione may have a key role in the defense against P. gingivalis infections.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - Comparison of culture methods and multiplex PCR for the detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in biofilm associated with severe forms of periodontitis.
AB  - Conventional culture methods and Multiplex PCR, both of which we have been used for a long time in our clinical microbiology laboratory, were compared for their ability to detect a selected panel of periodontopathic bacteria: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. Tests were performed in a single subgingival sample taken from a periodontal diseased site with a probing depth equal to or greater than 6mm. The results were compared site-by-site, taking into account the quality and the presence or absence of pathogens. 529 samples of subgingival plaque were analysed and the prevalence of the six species monitored varied in relation to the species itself and the method of detection. The most represented species is F. nucleatum, with a percentage of positive variability between 44.9% PCR and 46.5% culture test. Generally, the lowest prevalence was determined by culture test, with the exception of E. corrodens and F. nucleatum, which, unlike other bacteria, have been seen in higher percentages in culture with respect to PCR. For both methods, there was a good degree of accuracy in the determination of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, and P. gingivalis. It becomes weak for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. Both culture and PCR techniques introduced many methodological problems when applied in oral microbiology, but the ideal technique for accurate detection of pathogens in subgingival plaque samples has yet to be developed.
TI  - Granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. The chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (CXCL6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. Previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. Nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. In this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 arrays. The expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridizations. RESULTS: Among all known chemokines, GCP-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mRNA (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). Increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth, but not with attachment loss. Immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. CONCLUSION: The level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.
TI  - Periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (OPT) study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent clinical trial (Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy [OPT] Study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. The present study evaluated seven target bacteria, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the OPT Study and their association with birth outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. Subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and at 29 to 32 weeks. We analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). Samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Changes in bacterial counts and proportions during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. In full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (P <0.01) counts of all target species except for A. actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced levels of periodontal pathogens. Baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.
TI  - [Multiple brain abscesses of odontogenic origin caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum].
AB  - Infection caused by the anaerobic gram-negative rod Fusobacterium nucleatum belongs to endogenous infections. A 41-year-old man developed multiple brain abscesses of odontogenic origin. The main causes were poor oral hygiene and no dental check-ups. Pus aspired from a site in the brain contained DNA of the bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. Several teeth with periapical abscesses were extracted. Initially, the patient was treated empirically with a combination of cefotaxime and metronidazole (18 days). Subsequently, co-trimoxazole and rifampicin were administered (8 months). Four and eight months after the onset of the disease, MRI scans revealed only persistent residual changes in the brain parenchyma; the patient was asymptomatic, with no neurological signs and back at work.
TI  - Olfactory perception of cysteine-S-conjugates from fruits and vegetables.
AB  - Volatile sulfur compounds have a low odor threshold, and their presence at microgram per kilogram levels in fruits and vegetables influences odor quality. Sensory analysis demonstrates that naturally occurring, odorless cysteine- S-conjugates such as S-( R/ S)-3-(1-hexanol)- l-cysteine in wine, S-(1-propyl)- l-cysteine in onion, and S-(( R/ S)-2-heptyl)- l-cysteine in bell pepper are transformed into volatile thiols in the mouth by microflora. The time delay in smelling these volatile thiols was 20-30 s, and persistent perception of their odor occurred for 3 min. The cysteine- S-conjugates are transformed in free thiol by anaerobes. The mouth acts as a reactor, adding another dimension to odor perception, and saliva modulates flavors by trapping free thiols.
TI  - Effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  - We have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar bone lost through periodontal disease. The objective of the present study was to determine any antibacterial effect of ESWT on oral bacteria. Monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of ESWT at energy flux densities (EFD) of 0.12 mJ/mm(2), 0.22 mJ/mm(2), and 0.3 mJ/mm(2). Following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. ESWT showed a significant microbicidal effect for Streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of Porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mJ/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). In addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower EFDs. No significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at EFDs and pulses tested (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that low-energy ESWT may be bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections: clinical spectrum and incidence of invasive disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinically significant infections caused by members of the genus Fusobacterium are rare. We sought to describe the spectrum of clinical disease and epidemiology of these conditions presenting to an acute hospital over a five year period. METHODS: Clinical records relating to consecutive laboratory isolates of Fusobacterium species were reviewed and cases classified according to pre-specified definitions of primary site and invasive infection. RESULTS: 78 Fusobacterium isolates were identified, 25 of which were associated with invasive disease, most commonly in men (76% of cases). Invasive Fusobacterium necrophorum infection of the head and neck was not observed in patients over 50. Invasive intra-abdominal disease was not observed amongst those under 60. 2 cases of Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteraemia were identified in neutropenic children. One retroperitoneal abscess may have represented secondary infection due to periodontitis. Obstetric infections were the most common clinical syndromes associated with isolates from the female genital tract. The incidence of invasive head and neck disease in the population aged 15-50 was 6.7 per million/year. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fusobacterial infections are rare, affect distinct patient groups and are associated with good clinical outcomes in the majority of cases.
TI  - Stimulation of epithelial cell matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2, -9, -13) and interleukin-8 secretion by fusobacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial pathogens involved in periodontal diseases exert their destructive effects primarily by stimulating the host cells to increase their secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This study aimed to determine the epithelial cell matrix metalloproteinase and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion upon exposure to fusobacteria. METHODS: Eight different oral and non-oral Fusobacterium strains were incubated with HaCaT epithelial cells. Gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis were performed to detect collagenase 3 (MMP-13), gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), and IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells. RESULTS: All Fusobacterium strains, especially Fusobacterium necrophorum ATCC 25286, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, and Fusobacterium varium ATCC 51644, increased MMP-9 and MMP-13 secretion. Fusobacterium simiae ATCC 33568, and to a lesser extent F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum, increased epithelial MMP-2 secretion. F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum also increased IL-8 secretion. F. varium ATCC 27725, a strain that only weakly stimulated MMP production, strongly increased the IL-8 production, suggesting that their expression is differently regulated. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the pathogenic potential of fusobacteria may partly result from their ability to stimulate secretion of MMP-9, MMP-13, and IL-8 from epithelial cells.
TI  - Molecular identification and quantification of bacteria from endodontic infections using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It was the aim of the present study to evaluate root canal samples  for the presence and numbers of specific species as well as for total bacterial load in teeth with chronic apical periodontitis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: Forty adult patients with one radiographically documented periapical lesion were included. Twenty teeth presented with primary infections and 20 with secondary infections, requiring retreatment. After removal of necrotic pulp tissue or root canal filling, a first bacterial sample was obtained. Following chemo-mechanical root canal preparation a second sample was taken and a third sample was obtained after 14 days of intracanal dressing with calcium hydroxide. Analysis by real-time PCR enabled the quantification of total bacterial counts and of nine selected species. RESULTS: Root canals with primary infections harbored significantly more bacteria (by total bacterial count) than teeth with secondary infections (P < 0.05). Mean total bacterial count in the retreatment group was 2.1 x 10(6) and was significantly reduced following root canal preparation (3.6 x 10(4)) and intracanal dressing (1.4 x 10(5)). Corresponding values for primary infections were: 4.6 x 10(7), 3.6 x 10(4), and 6.9 x 10(4). The numbers of the selected bacteria and their detection frequency were also significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Root canals with primary infections contained a higher bacterial load. Chemo-mechanical root canal preparation reduced bacterial counts by at least 95%.
TI  - Rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by MALDI-TOF-MS.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. All the references and 10 clinical isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. All the strains were then analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS. RESULTS: The reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic MALDI-TOF-MS spectra with peaks between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. On visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. Obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. The reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. The spectra of the Prevotella intermedia strains identified with MALDI clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of Prevotella nigrescens, proving that MALDI-TOF-MS is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. The quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (Mathworks:/Matlab Reference Manual v2007a/, Statistical toolbox). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MALDI-TOF-MS might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. It may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.
TI  - The role of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production by macrophage cells stimulated with root canal pathogens.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periapical lesions arise as a result of the activation and interaction of the host immune responses against root canal infection. Recently identified Toll-like receptors (TLR) seem to be involved in the recognition and development of immune responses against a myriad of microorganisms. However, very little information is available on the role of TLR in the induction of periapical lesions. METHOD: The role of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in the activation of murine macrophages stimulated using Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was investigated. The production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are involved in the production of ROS by activated macrophages. The microorganisms induced similar levels of NO production by TLR-2-competent and TLR-2-deficient macrophages, regardless of the addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), ruling out a role for TLR-2 in the NO production induced by these bacteria. Only P. anaerobius induced NO production by TLR-4-competent macrophages without the addition of IFN-gamma. However, after IFN-gamma addition, F. nucleatum induced macrophage NO production. Therefore, NO production stimulated by IFN-gamma and these microorganisms seems to be TLR-4-independent. CONCLUSION: TLR-2 seems to be involved in the induction of ROS production by macrophages in response to prevalent root canal bacteria, while only F. nucleatum induced ROS production by TLR-4-competent macrophages. Both microorganisms significantly induced large amounts of NO independent of TLR-2 and TLR-4. We conclude that microorganisms may participate in the induction and progression of periapical lesions through NO and ROS production by activated macrophages.
TI  - [Bacteremia after periodontal procedures].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteremia frequently occurs after oral surgery and odontology procedures. Periodontitis may affect the incidence and bacterial spectrum of bacteremia. Periodontal disease may be a significant risk factor for the development of certain systemic diseases. This study has aimed to evaluate the frequency of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the bloodstream following scaling and root planing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with generalized chronic periodontitis were included in the study. Two samples of peripheral blood were drawn for culture at different times: pre-treatment and immediately after odontology treatment (full-mouth scaling). RESULTS: None of the 13 patients had bacteremia before the procedures. Bacteremia after scaling occurred in 10/13 (76.9 %) of periodontitis patients. The anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella spp., Micromonas micros and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were the most predominant microorganism. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that periodontal procedures induce bacteremia and may represent risk of developing systemic complications. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis is crucial for its prevention.
TI  - [Characterization and antibacterial effect of Ag-nHA-nTiO2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (Ag-nHA-nTiO2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (PA66) by co-polymerization method. The purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. METHODS: The morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. RESULTS: XRD results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (HA). A homogeneous distribution of the Ca, P, Ti and Ag element in the membrane was confirmed by EDX. Both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by SEM and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. The bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of S. aureus and 56.31% of E. coli were killed. However, 91.84% of P. gingivalis, 90.64% of F. nucleatum and 90.49% of S. mutans were killed and pictures of SEM showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. CONCLUSION: The nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
TI  - Identification of a methioninase inhibitor, myrsinoic acid B, from Myrsine seguinii Lev., and its inhibitory activities.
AB  - A methioninase inhibitor from Myrsine seguinii was purified and identified as myrsinoic acid B. Its inhibitory activities as to crude methioninase from periodontal bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola were determined. The IC50 values were 10.5, 82.4, and 30.3 microM respectively.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of PDT to non-surgical periodontal treatment. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). Full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing depth (PD), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. Primary outcome variables were changes in PD and CAL. Microbiologic evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to CAL, PD, FMPS, or microbiologic changes. At 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly greater improvement in FMBS was found in the test group. CONCLUSION: The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Laboratory maintenance of fusobacteria.
AB  - This unit describes routine laboratory handling of fusobacteria. Different media  that can be used to grow or enrich Fusobacterium nucleatum and other species of this genus are described. The growth and stock conditions as well as the susceptibility of F. nucleatum to oxygen in a pure culture are also discussed.
TI  - Rapid quantification of periodontitis-related bacteria using a novel modification of Invader PLUS technologies.
AB  - The Invader PLUS technology is a sensitive, rapid method for the detection and quantification of nucleic acid. While the original technology is based on the amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the target sequence followed by its detection using the Invader technology, the current modification allows simultaneous PCR amplification and Invader reaction. The PCR primers and the Invader probes are designed to operate at the same temperature. This allows simpler design and faster results. This technology has been applied for the quantification of six periodontitis-related bacteria (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Toreponema denticola, Tannerella forsythensis and Fusobacterium nucleatum). Direct comparison of this modified Invader PLUS with real-time PCR demonstrated similar linear range. Furthermore, testing of 64 volunteers showed a good correlation between both technologies with correlation factors r2 spanning between 0.827 and 0.987. We demonstrated here that the proposed improvement of the Invader PLUS allows the detection and quantification of DNA sequences using a simple design and protocol that can be implemented in clinical testing.
TI  - The influence of mineral trioxide aggregate on adaptive immune responses to endodontic pathogens in mice.
AB  - This study assessed the influence of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) on adaptive immune responses. BALB/c mice were immunized with heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in MTA or other control adjuvants, and serum IgG responses to Fn were measured. Either Fn- or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Pa)-reactive memory T cells (Tm) were preincubated in vitro with/without MTA and restimulated with Fn or Pa. Tm proliferation and cytokine production were assessed. Compared with control groups, immunoglobulin G-antibody responses were upregulated in mice immunized with Fn in MTA in a similar manner to animals immunized with Fn in Freund's adjuvant or aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Although MTA did not affect the upregulated expression of interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or RANKL by Tm, it suppressed the proliferation of Pa- or Fn-Tm and inhibited their production of Th1- or Th2-signature cytokines. MTA upregulated the adaptive humoral immune responses but had little or no effect on pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production by Tm.
TI  - Antiviral, antibacterial and vitamin C-synergized radical-scavenging activity of  Sasa senanensis Rehder extract.
AB  - Sasa senanensis Rehder extract (SE) showed slightly higher cytotoxicity against human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and human glioblastoma cell lines, as compared with human oral normal cells (gingival fibroblast, pulp cell, periodontal ligament fibroblast), and was more cytotoxic to human myelogenous and T-cell leukemia cell lines. SE showed a bacteriostatic effect on Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, but almost completely eliminated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) produced by these bacteria. SE protected human T-cell leukemia MT-4 cells from the cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and its anti-HIV activity was much higher than that of tannins and flavonoids, comparable with that of natural and synthetic lignins. SE also protected the MDCK cells from the cytopathic effect of influenza virus infection. SE synergistically enhanced the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity of vitamin C. The present study suggests the functionality of SE as a complementary alternative medicine.
TI  - [Study of adherence of periodontal pathogens to collagen-treated hydroxyapatite].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability of oral bacteria to adhere to tooth surface is associated  with their pathogenicity. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of 4 strains of periodontal pathogens attaching to collagen-treated hydroxyapatite (C-HA) beads in order to evaluate the ability of the main periodontal pathogens to form the biofilm on root surface. METHODS: The binding amount and binding percentage of 4 strains to C-HA were measured and compared by 3H-labeled binding assay. 4 strains of periodontal pathogens were Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) ATCC 10953, Porphyrin gingivalis (P. gingivalis) ATCC 33277, Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia) ATCC 25611 and Hemophilic actinomycetemcomitans (H. actinomycetemcomitans) ATCC 29523. RESULTS: The differences of the percentage of relative adherence between F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, as well as between H. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29523 and P. intermedia ATCC 25611 could not be observed. However, the percentage of relative adherence of F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 was higher than that of P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and H. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29523 (P<0.001), no matter cultured 24 h or 48 h. No significant difference of the percentage of the relative adherence of each stain between 24 h and 48 h cultured time could be found. CONCLUSION: F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis exhibited strong binding ability to C-HA. Their adherence to root surface may play an important role in their local aggregation, biofilm formation during the development and recurrence of the periodontitis.
TI  - Protein-lipid interactions with Fusobacterium nucleatum major outer membrane protein FomA: spin-label EPR and polarized infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - FomA, the major outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum, was expressed  and purified in Escherichia coli and reconstituted from detergent in bilayer membranes of phosphatidylcholines with chain lengths from C(12:0) to C(17:0). The conformation and orientation of membrane-incorporated FomA were determined from polarized, attenuated total reflection, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and lipid-protein interactions with FomA were characterized by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of spin-labeled lipids. Approximately 190 residues of membranous FomA are estimated to be in a beta-sheet configuration from IR band fitting, which is consistent with a 14-strand transmembrane beta-barrel structure. IR dichroism of FomA indicates that the beta-strands are tilted by approximately 45 degrees relative to the sheet/barrel axis and that the order parameter of the latter displays a discontinuity corresponding to hydrophobic matching with fluid C(13:0) lipid chains. The stoichiometry ( N b = 23 lipids/monomer) of lipid-protein interaction from EPR demonstrates that FomA is not trimeric in membranes of diC(14:0) phosphatidylcholine and is consistent with a monomeric beta-barrel of 14-16 strands. The pronounced selectivity of interaction found with anionic spin-labeled lipids places basic residues of the protein in the vicinity of the polar-apolar membrane interfaces, consistent with current topology models. Comparison with similar data from the 8- to 22-stranded E. coli outer membrane proteins, OmpA, OmpG, and FhuA, supports the above conclusions.
TI  - Third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. Full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. Presence or absence of third molars was noted. Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. Subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization. We analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. All subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. Differences between subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. Statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by Rank analysis of covariance. Significance was set at 0.05 without correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Most of the 26 subjects were African American (61%), on Medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). The 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [SD 6.4] vs 23.7 years [SD 3.9]). In the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. In the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. Differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for T. forsythia and P. nigrescens (P = .04), and for P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (P < .06). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of a glycosyltransferase homolog from an oral pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum as a human glycan-modifying enzyme.
AB  - Bacterial glycosyltransferases have drawn growing attention as economical enzymes for oligosaccharide synthesis, with their easy expression and relatively broad substrate specificity. Here, we characterized a glycosyltransferase homolog (Fnu_GT) from a human oral pathogen, Fusobacterium nucleatum. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Fnu_GT belongs to the glycosyltransferases family II. The recombinant Fnu_GT (rFnu_GT) expressed in Escherichia coli displayed the highest glycosylation activity when UDP-galactose (Gal) was used as a donor nucleotide-sugar with heptose or Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as an acceptor sugar. Interestingly, rFnu_GT transferred the galactose moiety of UDP-Gal to a nonreducing terminal GlcNAc attached to the trimannosyl core glycan, indicating its potential as an enzyme for humantype N-glycan synthesis.
TI  - Periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type I: report of three cases within a family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentin dysplasia type I (DDI) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. It is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (PAL). In this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of DDI but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. METHODS: A 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of DDI. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The mother presented 34.9% of sites with PD > or =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with CAL > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with BOP; both daughters presented no sites with PD or CAL >3 mm and <10% of sites with BOP. Microbiologic analysis detected Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. The daughters showed high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (Fusobacterium periodonticum and F. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (Streptococcus gordonii) and purple (Veillonella parvula) complexes. The mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (N. mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Treponema denticola, and V. parvula). CONCLUSION: A combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid PAL and to provide oral health in patients with DDI.
TI  - [Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli involved in the etiopathogeny of the abscesses of superficial fascial spaces of the face and neck].
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify at species level the strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) from pus samples collected in patients with abscesses of fascial spaces of the face and neck. Microscopy of Gram-stained smears and cultures were performed in each specimen. The strictly anaerobic GNB strains were identified using the conventional methods of diagnosis and the Rapid ID 32 A system. In addition, the other strains isolated in association with these bacteria were identified at least to genus level. The 28 anaerobic GNB isolates belonged to: Fusobacterium nucleatum and different species of Prevotella (4 species) and Bacteroides (3 species). CONCLUSIONS: The anaerobic GBN strains were recovered--either alone or in association with other migroorganisms--in more than half of all investigated samples and represented about 40% of all isolates. The most frequently isolated species were P> melaninogenica and B. ureolyticus.
TI  - Comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (S1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (S2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (S3) to compare microbial changes. METHOD: Twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. Chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% CHX gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [M1: Ca(OH)(2) paste; M2: 2% CHX gel; and M3: Ca(OH)(2) paste plus 2% CHX gel] were used for 7 days. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. Aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS: The species most frequently identified by checkerboard in S1 were: Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, Parvimonas micra and Enterococcus faecalis. In S2 and S3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (E. faecalis). Microorganisms were not identified after use of M2 for 7 days. The quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) CFU/ml in S1, mean CFU was reduced by 99.96% in S2, and there was no statistical difference between the CFU in S2 and S3. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main root canal.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - Differential gender effects of a reduced-calorie diet on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dietary manipulation, including caloric restriction, has been shown to impact host response capabilities significantly, particularly in association with aging. This investigation compared systemic inflammatory and immune-response molecules in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Monkeys on continuous long-term calorie-restricted diets and a matched group of animals on a control ad libitum diet, were examined for systemic response profiles including the effects of both gender and aging. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that haptoglobin and alpha1-antiglycoprotein levels were elevated in the serum of male monkeys. Serum IgG responses to Campylobacter rectus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly elevated in female monkeys. While only the antibody to Fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly affected by the calorie-restricted diet in female monkeys, antibody levels to Prevotella intermedia, C. rectus and Treponema denticola demonstrated a similar trend. CONCLUSION: In this investigation, only certain serum antibody levels were influenced by the age of male animals, which was seemingly related to increasing clinical disease in this gender. More generally, analytes were modulated by gender and/or diet in this oral model system of mucosal microbial challenge.
TI  - Rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  - Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia. Primers were designed from the 16S ribosomal RNA gene for each pathogen, and the LAMP amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees C. To simplify the manipulation of LAMP examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were tested as templates besides extracted DNA template. The detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted DNA template. However, LAMP methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. LAMPs for A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity compared with the conventional real-time PCR method. These findings suggest the usefulness of the LAMP method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, and the possibility of LAMP examination without the DNA extraction step.
TI  - [Relationship between herpesviruses and periodontal pathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence rates of human cytomegalovirus(HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus-1(EBV-1) in subgingival plaque and analyze the relationship between herpesviruses, periodontal pathogenic bacteria and periodontal clinical parameters in Chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis(AgP). METHODS: A total of one hundred and twenty subgingival plaque samples were collected from 89 AgP patients and 31 healthy subjects. HCMV and EBV-1 were detected using nested polymerase chain reaction(PCR).Contemporaneously, 8 periodontal pathogenic bacteria including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans(Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis(Pg), Tannerella forsythensis(Tf), Prevotella intermedia(Pi), Campylobacter rectus(Cr),Fusobacterium nucleatum(Fn), Treponema denticola(Td), Prevotella nigrescens(Pn) were detected by 16S rRNA based PCR. RESULTS: HCMV was more frequently detected in AgP patients (43.8%) than in healthy controls (12.9%, P<0.01). The prevalence rates of HCMV and EBV-1 in AgP patients with 6-8 kinds of bacteria detected were 54.4% and 17.4%, respectively, significantly higher than those with 3-5 kinds of bacteria detected (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of HCMV and EBV was higher in AgP patients than in healthy controls. Herpesviruses and periodontal pathogenic bacteria may cooperate synergistically in the development of AgP, which could be considered as a pathogenetic consortium in future investigation of periodontaltitis.
TI  - Experimental evidence supports the abscess theory of development of radicular cysts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to experimentally induce inflammatory  cysts in an animal model so as to test the hypothesis that radicular cysts develop via the "abscess pathway." METHODOLOGY: Twenty-eight perforated custom-made Teflon cages were surgically implanted into defined locations in the back of 7 Sprague Dawley rats. A week after the implantation of the cages, a known quantity of freshly grown, close allogeneic oral keratinocytes in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was injected into each cage. One cage per animal was treated as the control that received only epithelial cells. The remaining 3 cages of each animal were trials. Seven days post epithelial cell inoculation; a suspension of 0.2 mL of Fusobacterium nucleatum (10(8) bacteria per mL) was injected into each of the 3 trial cages. Two, 12, and 24 weeks after the inoculation of the bacteria, the cages were taken out, and the tissue contents were fixed and processed by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy. Sixteen of the 21 trial cages could be processed and yielded results. RESULTS: Inoculations of epithelial cells followed 1 week later by F. nucleatum into tissue cages resulted in the development inflammatory cysts in 2 of the 16 cages. The 2 cages contained a total of 4 cystic sites. None of the control cages showed the presence of any cyst-like pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory cysts were induced by initiating acute inflammatory foci (abscess/necrotic area) by bacterial injection that got enclosed by a proliferating epithelium. This finding provides strong experimental evidence in support of the "abscess theory" of development of radicular cysts.
TI  - Coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. The aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. Stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. While 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less common (4% incidence). Coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from Bacteroides fragilis with Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis with C. perfringens. Oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from B. adolescentis with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii with C. perfringens and F. nucleatum with Lactobacillus paracasei. Heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. It also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. Single-species biofilms of Streptococcus gordonii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of S. gordonii -- F. nucleatum and F. nucleatum -- P. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. Seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. The viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. Susceptibility tests and viability assays showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. These findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. Moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.
TI  - [Periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  - The prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high. A mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in CVD. Cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. The objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to CVD and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. The hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be founded in (I) shared infections etiology, (II) shared inflammatory response, (III) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (IV) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of CVD markers. Streptococcus species in the S. mitis group, and S. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. Other periodontal bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). Other bacteria in CVD and periodontitis include Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chlamydia pneumoniae and P. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. Associations between periodontitis and CVD have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. Other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. Thus, physicians caring for subjects at CVD risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. Dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at CVD risk.
TI  - The anti-endotoxic effects of the KSL-W decapeptide on Escherichia coli O55:B5 and various oral lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the KSL-W decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled KSL-W to detect adsorbed Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. A commercially available recombinant Factor C lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after KSL-W exposure to E. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using E. coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microM) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microM) for the KSL-W peptide when compared with its analog control. Significant inhibition of E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of KSL-W with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. Recombinant Factor C enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microM. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the KSL-W decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.
TI  - Photodynamic treatment of endodontic polymicrobial infection in vitro.
AB  - We investigated the photodynamic effects of methylene blue on multispecies root canal biofilms comprising Actinomyces israelii, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia in experimentally infected root canals of extracted human teeth in vitro. The 4 test microorganisms were detected in root canals by using DNA probes. Scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of biofilms in root canals before therapy. Root canal systems were incubated with methylene blue (25 microg/mL) for 10 minutes followed by exposure to red light at 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 J/cm(2). Light was delivered from a diode laser via a 250-microm diameter polymethyl methacrylate optical fiber that uniformly distributed light over 360 degrees. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) achieved up to 80% reduction of colony-forming unit counts. We concluded that PDT can be an effective adjunct to standard endodontic antimicrobial treatment when the PDT parameters are optimized.
TI  - Quercetin in a lotus leaves extract may be responsible for antibacterial activity.
AB  - In the course of a search for chemotherapeutic agents inhibiting suspected peridontitis bacteria, extracted and purified substances from lotus leaf were identified by antimicrobial activity tests with use of the broth micro-dilution methods on 96-microwell plate. The antimicrobial activity of extracts was tested against five microorganisms, namely: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Actinomyces viscosus 19246, Porphyromonas gingivalis 33277, Fusobacterium nucleatum 25586, and Actinomyces naeslundii wvl 45. The most active antimicrobial extract was subjected to spectroscopic analysis using UV, mass spectrometry, and by (1)H, (13)C-, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our data showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the most active extract were 0.625, 1.25, 1.25, 0.625 and 2.5 mg/mL for A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and A. naeslundii, respectively. The component that had a greatest antimicrobial activity was determined to be quercetin. Thus, we conclude that quercetin extracted from lotus leaves may be a potential antibacterial agent for periodontitis.
TI  - [Alterations of salivary flow rate and oral main pathogens in miniature pig with  bilateral parotid gland atrophy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of bilateral parotid gland atrophy on the whole  saliva flow rate and the growth of main oral pathogens in different sites of oral cavity. METHODS: Ten healthy miniature pigs were divided into two groups. The parotid glands of test group (n = 5) were bilaterally ablated by methyl violet. Another healthy five miniature pigs served as the control group. Whole saliva was collected and the whole saliva flow rate detected in both groups at 12 and 24 months respectively after parotid atrophy. The total numbers of oral main pathogens in the first molar, cuspid sub-gingival bacteria plaque and whole saliva were also detected. RESULTS: The whole saliva flow rate was significantly decreased at both 12 and 24 months respectively after atrophy of bilateral parotid gland in miniature pig. Pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in different sites oral cavity were increased after bilateral parotid gland atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral ablation of the parotid glands led to a significant decrease of whole saliva flow rate. The total numbers of main oral pathogens were increased in different sites of oral cavity.
TI  - Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans display surface variations consistent with observed intergeneric coaggregation.
AB  - Adherence of yeasts to other microorganisms and epithelial cell surfaces is important in their colonization. Comparative studies based on the coaggregation of Candida dubliniensis versus Candida albicans with Fusobacterium nucleatum and other oral bacteria suggested differences in the surfaces of these yeasts. Transmission electron microscopy was used to test the hypothesis that there are morphologic variations in the cell surface of these two species. C. dubliniensis type strain CD36 and C. albicans ATCC 18804 were grown on Sabouraud's dextrose agar at various growth temperatures. In some experiments suspensions of yeast cells were treated with dithiothreitol. Fixation for transmission electron microscopy was accomplished using dimethylsulfoxide and alcian blue added to 3% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldahyde in cacodylate buffer. The cell wall of both species was predominantly electron lucent and was visibly differentiated into several layers. A thin electron dense outer layer was seen with clearly visible fibrillar structures, closely associated to the cytoplasmic membrane. The length of the fibrils of the C. albicans cells grown at 37 degrees C was approximately two times greater than those of the cells grown at 25 degrees C. The fibrils of the 37 degrees C-grown cells were thin, distinct and tightly packed whereas those of the 25 degrees C-grown cells appeared blunt, loosely spaced and aggregated. C. dubliniensis demonstrated short, blunt fibrils appearing similar to those of the 25 degrees C-grown C. albicans cells. C. dubliniensis showed no difference in the density, length and arrangement of fibrils between the 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C growth temperatures. The shortest and most aggregated fibrils seen were of the 45 degrees C-grown C. albicans cells. Dithiothreitoltreated 37 degrees C-grown C. albicans cells revealed a distorted and partially destroyed fibrillar layer. In this investigation C. dubliniensis, unlike C. albicans, displayed an outer fibrillar layer that did not vary with variations in growth temperature. In addition, the fibrils on the C. dubliniensis cells were similar to those of the 25 degrees C-grown C. albicans in that they were considerably shorter and less dense than those of the 37 degrees C-grown C. albicans cells. It can be postulated, that C. dubliniensis exhibits constant cell surface characteristics consistent with hydrophobicity and that this property may give this species an ecological advantage. Therefore, C. dubliniensis may compete well in oral environments via enhanced attachment to oral microbes and other surfaces, perhaps even more efficiently than C. albicans.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of PDT in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. Twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (FMPS), full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), bleeding on probing (BOP) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival recession (REC), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Primary outcome variables were changes in PPD and CAL. Microbiological evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), Prevotella intermedia (P.i.), Tannerella forsythensis (T.f.), Treponema denticola (T.d.), Peptostreptococcus micros (P.m.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.), Campylobacter rectus (C.r.), Eubacterium nodatum (E.n.), Eikenella corrodens (E.c.), and Capnocytophaga species (C.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. No differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. At 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of PPD, CAL and FMPS. At 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of BOP was found in the test group. At 3 months after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of F.n. and E.n. in the test group. At 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of E.c. and C.s. were detected in the test group. The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PPD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to induce tissue-destructive molecules from human neutrophils.
AB  - AIM: The induction of tissue-destructive molecules from neutrophils by periodontopathic bacteria has been suggested as one of the mechanisms of periodontal destruction. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ability to stimulate neutrophils is an authentic characteristic of periodontopathic bacteria. METHODS: We evaluated, along with phagocytosis, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and interleukin-1beta by neutrophils in response to non-periodontopathic Streptococcus sanguinis and periodontopathic bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola, in the absence or presence of antibodies. Phagocytosis, the death of neutrophils, and intracellular ROS production were measured by flow cytometry and the concentrations of MMP-8 and interleukin-1beta secreted into medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: S. sanguinis and F. nucleatum induced greater production of ROS, MMP-8, and interleukin-1beta than did T. denticola. The levels of tissue-destructive molecules produced by neutrophils had a positive correlation with phagocytosis. Opsonization of bacteria with antibodies significantly increased phagocytosis and ROS production and release, thus increasing both bacterial clearance and potential tissue damage. CONCLUSION: The ability of oral bacteria to induce tissue-destructive molecules from neutrophils is not an inherent characteristic of periodontopathic bacteria, which would provide a new insight into the role of neutrophils in periodontal destruction.
TI  - Effects of age and oral disease on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  - This report evaluated systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in a cohort of  Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) maintained as a large family social unit, including an age range from <1 year to >24 years. We hypothesized that the systemic host responses would be affected by the age, gender, and clinical oral presentation of the population, each contributing to inflammatory and immune responses that would reflect chronic oral infections. The results demonstrated that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, including missing teeth, increased significantly with age. Generally, minimal differences in clinical parameters were noted between the genders. Systemic inflammatory mediators, including acute-phase reactants, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), cytokines/chemokines, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), demonstrated significant differences among the various age groups of animals. Levels of many of these were increased with age, although PGE(2), RANTES, bactericidal permeability-inducing factor (BPI), MMP-1, and MMP-9 levels were significantly increased in the young group ( approximately 1 to 3 years old) relative to those for the older animals. We observed that in the adult and aged animals, levels of the systemic inflammatory mediators related to gingival inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction were significantly elevated. Serum antibody levels in response to a battery of periodontal pathogens were generally lower in the young animals, <50% of those in the adults, and were significantly related to aging in the cohort. The levels of antibodies, particularly those to Porphorymonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Tannerella forsythia, were most significantly elevated in animals with periodontal disease, irrespective of the age of the animal. These results provide a broad description of oral health and host responses in a large cohort of nonhuman primates from very young animals to the aged of this species. The findings afford a base of data with which to examine the ontogeny of host responses at mucosal sites, such as the gingival tissues.
TI  - [Prediction on the efficacy of fluoroquinolones for anaerobic infections using Monte Carlo simulation].
AB  - Various analysis based on PK-PD (pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics) theory were performed for prediction on the efficacy of antimicrobial agents for infectious diseases. However, there have been few reports when causative organisms would be anaerobic bacteria. Although the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against anaerobes has been weak, gatifloxacin (GFLX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), and garenoxacin (GRNX) are considered as anti-anaerobic quinolones in recent days. Therefore, we investigated prediction on the efficacy of fluoroquinolones for anaerobic infections using Monte Carlo Simulation. Although the target attainment of fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, GFLX, and MFLX) on AUC/MIC value has not established yet, we have assumed 40 and 125 as the target attainment of AUC/MIC value. GFLX and MFLX would be effective against anaerobic infections caused by Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Micromonas micros, which are the causative organisms for respiratory tract infections. From these results, GFLX and MFLX would be effective against anaerobic infections in respiratory tract as anti-anaerobic fluoroquinolones.
TI  - A rare presentation of ventriculitis and brain abscess caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Anaerobic ventriculitis is rare, and usually seen in patients with predisposing factors such as otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis or recent neurosurgery. We report what we believe to be the first case of ventriculitis and brain abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum infection in a man with no significant predisposing factors. He was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Impact of growth conditions on susceptibility of five microbial species to alkaline stress.
AB  - The effects of different growth conditions on the susceptibility of five taxa to  alkaline stress were investigated. Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176, Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 were grown as planktonic cells, allowed to adhere to dentin for 24 hours, grown as monospecies or multispecies biofilms on dentin under anaerobic conditions with a serum-enriched nutrient supply at 37 degrees C for 5 days. In addition, suspended biofilm microorganisms and 5-day old planktonic multispecies cultures were used. Microbial recovery upon direct exposure to saturated calcium hydroxide solution (pH 12.5) for 10 and 100 minutes was compared with control exposure to physiologic saline. Planktonic microorganisms were most susceptible; only E. faecalis and C. albicans survived in saturated solution for 10 minutes, the latter also for 100 minutes. Dentin adhesion was the major factor in improving the resistance of E. faecalis and A. naeslundii to calcium hydroxide, whereas the multispecies context in a biofilm was the major factor in promoting resistance of S. sobrinus to the disinfectant. In contrast, the C. albicans response to calcium hydroxide was not influenced by the growth condition. Adherence to dentin and interspecies interactions in a biofilm appear to differentially affect the sensitivity of microbial species to calcium hydroxide.
TI  - A microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Veillonella parvula, Treponema socranskii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Campylobacter gracilis and in asymptomatic cases were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, E. faecalis, Eubacterium saburreum, and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts and counts of Tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of Propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. The data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of T. forsythia and the presence of pain.
TI  - Serum antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis chaperone HtpG predict health in periodontitis susceptible patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chaperones are ubiquitous conserved proteins critical in stabilization of new proteins, repair/removal of defective proteins and immunodominant antigens in innate and adaptive immunity. Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infection associated with infection by Porphyromonas gingivalis that culminates in the destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. We previously reported studies of serum antibodies reactive with the human chaperone Hsp90 in gingivitis, a reversible form of gingival disease confined to the oral soft tissues. In those studies, antibodies were at their highest levels in subjects with the best oral health. We hypothesized that antibodies to the HSP90 homologue of P. gingivalis (HtpG) might be associated with protection/resistance against destructive periodontitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: ELISA assays using cloned HtpG and peptide antigens confirmed gingivitis subjects colonized with P. gingivalis had higher serum levels of anti-HtpG and, concomitantly, lower levels of attachment loss. Additionally, serum antibody levels to P. gingivalis HtpG protein were higher in healthy subjects compared to patients with either chronic or aggressive periodontitis. We found a negative association between tooth attachment loss and anti-P. gingivalis HtpG (p = 0.043) but not anti-Fusobacterium nucleatum (an oral opportunistic commensal) HtpG levels. Furthermore, response to periodontal therapy was more successful in subjects having higher levels of anti-P. gingivalis HtpG before treatment (p = 0.018). There was no similar relationship to anti-F. nucleatum HtpG levels. Similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with a synthetic peptide of a region of P. gingivalis HtpG. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST: 1) anti-P. gingivalis HtpG antibodies are protective and therefore predict health periodontitis-susceptable patients; 2) may augment the host defence to periodontitis and 3) a unique peptide of P. gingivalis HtpG offers significant potential as an effective diagnostic target and vaccine candidate. These results are compatible with a novel immune control mechanism unrelated to direct binding of bacteria.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - [Microbiological and biochemical characteristics of inflammatory tissues in the periodontium].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate bacterial populations in subgingival and supragingival  plaque samples of patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases and activities of the lysosomal enzymes--lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase--in peripheral venous blood, in gingival crevicular fluid, and mixed nonstimulated saliva. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study included 60 patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases without any internal pathology and 24 periodontally healthy subjects. Molecular genetic assay (Micro-IDent plus, Germany) for complex identification of additional six periodontopathic bacteria was applied. The activity of lysozyme was determined turbidimetrically, the activity of alkaline phosphatase--spectrophotometrically with a "Monarch" biochemical analyzer, the activity beta-glucuronidase--according to the method described by Mead et al. and modified by Strachunskii. RESULTS: A statistically significant association between clinical and bacteriological data was found in the following cases: gingival bleeding in the presence of Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga spp. (P<0.01); pathological periodontal pockets in the presence of Peptostreptococcus micros (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), Fusobacterium nucleatum (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), Campylobacter rectus (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), and Capnocytophaga spp. (P<0.05); and satisfactory oral hygiene in the presence of all microorganisms investigated (P<0.05). The activity of lysozyme in gingival crevicular fluid and mixed nonstimulated saliva indicates the severity of periodontal inflammation. Based on clinical data, in assessing the amount of lysozyme in mixed nonstimulated saliva, sensitivity and specificity of 100% was found. Increased activities of lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase were found in peripheral venous blood of patients with inflammatory periodontal disease as compared to control group. CONCLUSIONS: The main principles of the treatment of periodontal inflammatory diseases should be based on microorganism elimination, creation of individual treatment means affecting microflora in the mouth and immune system of macroorganisms.
TI  - Bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study.
AB  - AIM: Various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. We tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 706 Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study (INVEST) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (BoP), pocket depth (PD) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. Eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (EB, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia); (ii) putative burden (PB, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Micromonas micros, Prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (HAB, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula). RESULTS: After mutual adjustment for EB, PB and HAB, the BoP prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of EB while BoP decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of HAB. Mean PD increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of EB (p<0.0001) and HAB ( p<0.0001), respectively. Among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile EB, 60% were collected from sites with PD < or =3 mm. CONCLUSION: Bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with BoP in sites with minimal PD and/or attachment level (AL). Species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with BoP.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Role of Porphyromonas gingivalis SerB in gingival epithelial cell cytoskeletal remodeling and cytokine production.
AB  - The SerB protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is a HAD family serine phosphatase that plays a critical role in entry and survival of the organism in gingival epithelial cells. SerB is secreted by P. gingivalis upon contact with epithelial cells. Here it is shown by microarray analysis that SerB impacts the transcriptional profile of gingival epithelial cells, with pathways involving the actin cytoskeleton and cytokine production among those significantly overpopulated with differentially regulated genes. Consistent with the transcriptional profile, a SerB mutant of P. gingivalis exhibited defective remodeling of actin in epithelial cells. Interaction between gingival epithelial cells and isolated SerB protein resulted in actin rearrangement and an increase in the F/G actin ratio. SerB protein was also required for P. gingivalis to antagonize interleukin-8 accumulation following stimulation of epithelial cells with Fusobacterium nucleatum. SerB is thus capable of modulating host cell signal transduction that impacts the actin cytoskeleton and cytokine production.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  - Culture-based studies have shown that Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (RC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the bacterial diversity of RC in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. Plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no RC and from 11 subjects with RC. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. From a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. The majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. Species of Selenomonas and Veillonella were common in all samples. The healthy microbiota included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia spp., Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus cristatus, and Kingella oralis. Lactobacilli were absent, S. mutans was present in one, and Actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. In contrast, the microbiota of the RC subjects was dominated by Actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, S. mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Selenomonas sp. clone CS002, Atopobium and Olsenella spp., Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Propionibacterium sp. strain FMA5. The bacterial profiles of RC showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. The data suggest that putative etiological agents of RC include not only S. mutans, lactobacilli, and Actinomyces but also species of Atopobium, Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Propionibacterium, and Selenomonas.
TI  - [Detection of periodontal pathogens in coronary atherosclerotic plaques].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible correlation between coronary heart disease and periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples and coronary atherosclerotic plaques were harvested from a total of 31 patients with periodontitis who scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery. The bacteria DNA was obtained from subgingival plaque samples and coronary atherosclerotic plaques using the chelex-100 method. The extracted DNA was examined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. RESULTS: In coronary atherosclerotic plaques samples from the 31 patients, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg, 38.7%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa, 0%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn, 22.6%), Prevotella intermedia (Pi, 12.9%), Bacteroides forsythus (Bf, 38.7%) were detected. The concordant presence of the same periodontal bacteria DNA in subgingival plaques and in coronary atherosclerotic plaques in the same patient was Pg 5 (16.1%), Aa 0 (0%), Pi 2 (6.5%), Fn 4 (12.9%) and Bf 8 (25.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of periodontal bacteria DNA in coronary atherosclerotic plaques could indicate that periodontal pathogenic bacteria may play a role in the coronary heart disease process.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess related to dental disease in an immunocompetent host.
AB  - A 59-year-old man with poor oral hygiene presented to our hospital because of fever and chills. Abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a liver abscess. The patient had no history of immunodeficiency and we confirmed the patient had no immunologic abnormalities. Blood culture revealed Fusobacterium nucleatum, a bacterium commonly found in the oral cavity. Even if a patient is immunocompetent, poor oral hygiene might be an independent risk factor for a pyogenic liver abscess. Professional mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC) and appropriate self-care are recommended as a prophylaxis against not only dental, but also systemic diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, BSA) against some bacterial samples (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). In the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). The agar diffusion test was the second model used. In half the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. Bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. Each test was repeated 10 times. In the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (CHX) did not eliminate E. faecalis at any tested time. CHX at 0.5% eliminated all strains except E. faecalis after immediate contact. All strains were eliminated by 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl. BSA did not interfere with the antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. In the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, BSA interfered with the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl and CHX. Under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% CHX was ineffective in eliminating E. faecalis, while 0.5% CHX, 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. The addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.
TI  - Thoracic vertebral actinomycosis: Actinomyces israelii and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Actinomyces spp. are considered rare pathogens in today's medicine, especially with thoracic vertebral involvement. Classic actinomycosis (50%) presents as an oral-cervicofacial ("lumpy jaw") infection. This report describes a case of spinal cord compression caused by Actinomyces israelii with the coisolation of Fusobacterium nucleatum. There are limited numbers of similar cases.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontal pathogens in subgingival lesions, atherosclerotic plaques and healthy blood vessels: a preliminary study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have reported different periodontal bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions, but their involvement in plaque formation remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of 20 periodontal bacteria in atherosclerotic samples and healthy blood vessels (used as controls) and to clarify their relationship in regard to clinical and bacteriological periodontal status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The day before vascular surgery the patients had a thorough periodontal examination and bacteriological samples were taken from periodontally diseased sites. Atheromatous plaques, internal mammary arteries and saphenous veins were harvested during surgery. A DNA-DNA hybridization procedure was used to screen periodontal and vascular samples for the 20 selected bacterial species. RESULTS: Periodontal samples from the severe periodontitis group were found to have a higher prevalence and biomass of bacterial species than the moderate periodontitis group. In vessel samples, the prevalence of the same 20 bacterial species analyzed together was similar in the two groups, except for saphenous veins. CONCLUSION: The presence of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic plaques and in apparently healthy vessels appeared to reflect a higher level of bacteremia rather than infection of endothelial cells.
TI  - Genotypic diversity of anaerobic isolates from bloodstream infections.
AB  - Accurate species determination for anaerobes from blood culture bottles has become increasingly important with the reemergence of anaerobic bacteremia and prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant microorganisms. Our knowledge of the taxonomical diversity of anaerobes that cause bloodstream infections is extremely limited, because identification historically has relied on conventional methods. Over a 5-year period, we profiled anaerobic bacteremia at a large tertiary care hospital with 16S rRNA gene sequencing to gain a better understanding of the taxonomical diversity of the bacteria. Of 316 isolates, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified 316 (100%) to the genus or taxonomical group level and 289 (91%) to the species level. Conventional methods identified 279 (88%) to the genus level and 208 (66%) to the species level; 75 (24%) were misidentified at the species level, and 33 (10%) results were inconclusive. High intragenus variability was observed for Bacteroides and Clostridium species, and high intraspecies variability was observed for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Sequence-based identification has potential benefits in comparison to conventional methods, because it more accurately characterizes anaerobes within taxonomically related clusters and thereby may enable better correlation with specific clinical syndromes and antibiotic resistance patterns.
TI  - Interactions between salivary Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  - Coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. Bifidobacterium adolescentis OLB6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii JCM8350, Streptococcus mitis OLS3293, Streptococcus sanguinis JCM5708, Veillonella parvula ATCC17745 or Porphyromonas gingivalis OB7124, but it did coaggregate with Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532. Subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using FISH revealed that B. adolescentis OLB6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. It did, however, adhere to biofilms of A. naeslundii, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with A. naeslundii nor with V. parvula. These results suggest that the adhesion of B. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. Heat- or proteinase K-treated F. nucleatum could not coaggregate with B. adolescentis. Similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase K-treated B. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. It is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of B. adolescentis and F. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. The data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.
TI  - Generation of indole/skatole during malodor formation in the salivary sediment model system and initial examination of the oral bacteria involved.
AB  - Gram negative anaerobic microbial degradation of proteins, peptides and amino acids in saliva leads to production of oral malodor. Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) from cysteine and indole/skatole (I/S) from tryptophan are two major components of breath odor. In this study, salivary mixed bacteria and oral pure cultures were compared for their ability to produce odor from cysteine, tryptophan and salivary supernatant. The VSC malodor inhibitor, zinc, was used to help identify the malodor processes involved. Salivary sediment and salivary supernatant were both obtained from wax-stimulated whole saliva. Gram positive (13) and Gram negative (12) oral pure cultures of common salivary bacteria were each grown in appropriate media and harvested. Incubation mixtures were prepared with salivary sediment at 16.7% (v/v) or bacterial pure cultures at 8.3% (v/v). Cysteine or tryptophan at 6 mM or salivary supernatant at 33.3% (v/v) was added. When included, zinc as ZnCl(2) was added at 6 mM. All incubations were carried out for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Odor generation was assessed organoleptically (0-4 severity scale); VSC was determined with a Halimeter (Interscan Corp., Chatsworth, CA) and I/S was determined using Kovac's colorimetric method. Organoleptic odor levels produced by salivary sediment mixed bacteria with the three substrates tested were comparable, though tryptophan and cysteine generated distinct and characteristic odors. With cysteine and supernatant, rapid and substantial VSC was generated; with tryptophan no such VSC formation was observed. Zinc inhibited VSC generation from cysteine and from salivary supernatant but had no effect on I/S from tryptophan. Surprisingly though, zinc which had no effect on I/S production from free tryptophan, reduced I/S production from supernatant. Of the 12 Gram negative bacteria, 75% produced I/S (mean 3.1 +/- 1.5 SEM mg ml(-1)); most was generated by Porphyromonas intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Gram positive pure cultures produced none. Comparable levels of organoleptic odor were produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis from tryptophan and cysteine. Malodor produced orally is complex because multiple microbial types, substrates, metabolic pathways and hence end products are involved. Zinc clearly inhibited I/S production in salivary supernatant, possibly by interfering with the release of tryptophan from peptides/proteins.
TI  - Tongue biofilm areal density and tongue coating index.
AB  - Two methods have been employed to measure the amount of tongue biofilm in humans: (1) areal density of microbes (cfu cm(-2)) (tongue scrape from a known/measured area), or (2) a tongue-coating index, where a human judge assesses the amount of 'coating' by visual inspection. The two methods were compared, both on human volunteers and on artificial biofilms. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm) and Peptostreptococcus micros (Pm) were obtained from stock cultures. Tongue scrape samples were obtained from four human volunteers in order to inoculate the in vitro matrices. A further 16 individuals (total n = 20) were co-measured for both visible tongue coating and quantitative biofilm (cfu cm(-2)). Tongue scrape suspensions were used to inoculate a cellulose matrix resting on a BHI-blood agar plate, periodically hydrated with sterile BHI and incubated for 10 days. Visual coating density images were recorded by camera. The relative light absorbance of standard suspensions of cells (pure species) was obtained by spectrophotometry across the visible spectrum. Biomatrix yields (log cfu cm(-2) +/- SD) for Fn, Pi, Sm and Pm were 7.07 (+/-0.04), 7.38 (+/-0.07), 7.25 (+/-0.10) and 7.41 (+/-0.011). Higher yields were obtained for tongue-scrape mixed cultures, ranging from 7.47 to 7.76. Biofilms (in vitro and in vivo) had different appearances when measured by human judges in terms of colour, pigmentation and opacity. There was no correlation (R(2) < 0.02) between the two methods. Biofilm matrices of similar population densities (ca approximately log 7.5) had widely different opacities depending on the species present.
TI  - Colonization pattern of periodontal bacteria in Japanese children and their mothers.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the time of  infection by anaerobic gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, and to clarify their transmission from mother to child. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-eight Japanese children (including 10 siblings), aged from 3 to 9 years, and 68 mothers, were enrolled in this study. Colonization by 11 periodontal bacterial species was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification of samples of subgingival plaque obtained from the children and their mothers. RESULTS: The detection rates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola increased in children after the age of 6 years. We found a high consistency in colonization by P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in 9 of the 10 siblings. The average number of bacterial species in plaque samples harboring Fusobacterium nucleatum and/or Fusobacterium periodonticum was significantly greater than in those without, in both children and mothers. Kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Campylobacter rectus and T. denticola in children was consistent with that in the mother. CONCLUSION: Periodontal bacterial colonization in Japanese children increased with age and was associated with F. nucleatum and/or periodonticum, and the bacterial flora in children was similar to that in their mothers.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype f O-polysaccharide mediates coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intergeneric bacterial coaggregation may play an important role  in plaque development. METHODS: In this study we investigated the coaggregation reaction between two periodontal pathogens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum. RESULTS: Previous studies showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b strains coaggregate with F. nucleatum strain PK1594, and that A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b O-polysaccharide (O-PS) is the receptor responsible for coaggregation between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype f O-PS has been shown to be structurally and antigenically related to serotype b O-PS. In the present study we show that A. actinomycetemcomitans strain CU1060N, a serotype f strain, also coaggregated with F. nucleatum PK1594. Like coaggregation between serotype b strains and F. nucleatum, coaggregation between CU1060N and F. nucleatum was inhibited by galactose. An O-PS mutant of CU1060N failed to coaggregate with F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: We concluded that A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype f O-PS, like serotype b O-PS, mediates coaggregation between A. actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacteria.
TI  - SMAP29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. SMAP29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of SMAP29, SMAP28, and three congeners (SMAP18A, SMAP18D, and SMAP14A). METHODS: The peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity against multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. Cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. RESULTS: SMAP28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, P < 0.05); however, the activity of SMAP28 and SMAP29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). The congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). Overall, F. nucleatum was the most susceptible organism, while P. gingivalis was the least susceptible. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. SMAP28 was the most cytotoxic, while SMAP14A was the least cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of SMAP29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other oral diseases.
TI  - A case report of a pyogenic liver abscess caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in a  patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis.
AB  - Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is a process with significant morbidity and mortality and is a rare complication in an aisled way in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In addition to hepatic cyst infection, intracystic hemorrhage is another complication seen in ADPKD patients; however, the liver parenchyma itself remains normal. A PLA located in normal liver tissue in these kinds of patients has not been previously reported. Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic bacterium with rare involvement other than in periodontal infections. A 58-year-old Caucasian male, who was on hemodialysis treatment from July 2004 due to end-stage renal disease secondary to ADPKD, was admitted with fever, rigor, chills, weakness, and abdominal pain of 10 days duration. During that time, ciprofloxacin 500 mg, twice daily, gentamycin 80 mg/48 h, and vancomycin 1 g/week, were prescribed, but treatment was interrupted by hospitalization. Physical examination on admission revealed that the patient had a fever of 39.8 degrees C, pallor, chills, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5.3 cm diameter collection with irregular configuration located in the caudate lobe. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a large multiloculated hepatic collection. The PLA was managed with antibiotics (metronidazole) and continuous catheter drainage (8Fr drainage catheters [Abocath-T, Abbott, Sligo, Ireland]) into the abscess. Fluid culture was positive for F. nucleatum. Complete remission was obtained after 12 days without complications. We describe a PLA by F. nucleatum, in a very rare location in an ADPKD patient undergoing hemodialysis without complicated cysts, managed with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage with satisfactory resolution.
TI  - In vitro antioxidant potential of medicinal plant extracts and their activities against oral bacteria based on Brazilian folk medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine antibacterial activities  of Cocos nucifera (husk fiber), Ziziphus joazeiro (inner bark), Caesalpinia pyramidalis (leaves), aqueous extracts and Aristolochia cymbifera (rhizomes) alcoholic extract against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei. The antioxidant activity and acute toxicity of these extracts were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The plant extracts antibacterial activity was evaluated in vitro and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth micro-dilution assay. The bacterial killing kinetic was also evaluated for all extracts. In addition, the antibacterial effect of the extracts was tested in vitro on artificial oral biofilms. The acute toxicity of each extract was determined in according to Lorke [Lorke D. A new approach to practical acute toxicity testing. Arch Toxicol 1983;54:275-87] and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH photometric assay [Mensor LL, Menezes FS, Leitao GG, Reis AS, Santos TC, Coube CS, et al. Screening of Brazilian plants extract for antioxidant activity by the use of DPPH free radical method. Phytother Res 2001;15:127-30]. RESULTS: MIC and the bactericidal concentrations were identical, for each evaluated extract. However, microbes of artificial biofilms were less sensitive to the extracts than the planktonic strains. A. cymbifera extract induced the highest bactericidal effect against all tested bacteria, followed by C. nucifera, Z. joazeiro and C. pyramidalis extracts, respectively. All extracts showed good antioxidant potential, being C. nucifera and C. pyramidalis aqueous extracts the most active ones. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, all oral bacteria tested (planktonic or in artificial biofilms) were more susceptible to, and rapidly killed in presence of A. cymbifera, C. pyramidalis and C. nucifera than Z. joazeiro extracts, respectively. Thus, these extracts may be of great interest for future studies about treatment of oral diseases, considering their potent antioxidant activity and low toxicity.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of OXA-63, a new class D beta-lactamase  from Brachyspira pilosicoli BM4442.
AB  - Brachyspira pilosicoli BM4442, isolated from the feces of a patient with diarrhea at the Hospital Saint-Michel in Paris, was resistant to oxacillin (MIC > 256 microg/ml) but remained susceptible to cephalosporins and to the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding resistance determinant revealed a coding sequence of 807 bp encoding a new class D beta-lactamase named OXA-63. The bla OXA-63 gene was chromosomally located and not part of a transposon or of an integron. OXA-63 shared 54% identity with FUS-1 (OXA-85), an oxacillinase from Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, and 25 to 44% identity with other class D beta-lactamases (DBLs) and contained all the conserved structural motifs of DBLs. Escherichia coli carrying the bla OXA-63 gene exhibited resistance to benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin but remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. Mature OXA-63 consisted of a 31.5-kDa polypeptide and appeared to be dimeric. Kinetic analysis revealed that OXA-63 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing oxacillin, benzylpenicillin, and ampicillin with catalytic efficiencies of 980, 250, and 150 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively. The enzyme did not apparently interact with oxyimino-cephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. Unlike FUS-1 and other DBLs, OXA-63 was strongly inhibited by clavulanic acid (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 2 microM) and tazobactam (IC50 of 0.16 microM) and exhibited low susceptibility to NaCl (IC50 of >2 M). OXA-63 is the first DBL described for the anaerobic spirochete B. pilosicoli.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - Relationship between Campylobacter rectus and periodontal status during pregnancy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In a previous study, we showed that the growth of Campylobacter rectus is stimulated by the presence of female sex hormones in the culture medium. In the present study, we examined the relationship between C. rectus levels in the saliva and the periodontal status of pregnant women. METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 22 pregnant and 15 non-pregnant women. Periodontal pocket depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the concentrations of suspected periodontopathogenic bacteria in the saliva samples. In addition, the concentration of estradiol in the saliva samples was measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The average age, number of teeth, and total number of bacteria in the saliva of subjects in both groups were similar. The percentage of sites with a PD = 4 mm and the salivary estradiol concentrations were significantly higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. In addition, the percentage of BOP sites and the C. rectus levels in the saliva of the pregnant women tended to be higher than in non-pregnant women, although these differences were not statistically significant. There were positive correlations between C. rectus levels and estradiol concentrations, and between C. rectus levels and the percentage of sites with PD = 4 mm in the pregnant women. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that C. rectus levels are higher in the oral flora of pregnant women and that this may be associated with increased salivary estradiol concentrations. This may contribute to periodontal disease progression during pregnancy.
TI  - Proteomic analysis of ampicillin-resistant oral Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fusobacterium nucleatum represents one of the predominant anaerobic species in the oral microbiota. Penicillin-resistant F. nucleatum have been isolated from intra- and extraoral infections. This study aimed to assess ampicillin resistance in F. nucleatum by investigating the synthesis of resistance-associated proteins. METHODS: Ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-susceptible F. nucleatum isolates were obtained from 22 dental plaque samples. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were used to investigate bacterial protein synthesis. Proteins exhibiting statistically significant quantitative changes between sensitive and resistant isolates were identified using peptide mass mapping and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Twenty-three F. nucleatum isolates were recovered from plaque samples and their ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged between 0.125 microg/ml and 256 microg/ml. Analysis of the bacterial cellular proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved 154-246 distinct protein spots (mean 212, n = 9). Between 32% and 83% of the protein spots were common for the F. nucleatum isolates. Comparisons of the protein profiles of sensitive and resistant isolates revealed the presence of a 29 kDa protein and significant increases in the synthesis of two proteins at 37 and 46 kDa in the ampicillin-resistant F. nucleatum isolates. These proteins were identified as a class D beta-lactamase, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ATP-binding protein and enolase, respectively. CONCLUSION: Synthesis of a class D beta-lactamase by ampicillin-resistant F. nucleatum isolates could complicate antimicrobial treatment because these enzymes might confer resistance to many classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. The differences observed in protein synthesis between ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-susceptible F. nucleatum may contribute to the antibiotic resistance and virulence of these bacteria.
TI  - Stimulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. Eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. METHODS: Microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. Growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by P. gingivalis. It was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with P. gingivalis. Enhancement of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxS. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by F. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of association between herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of human periodontitis may depend upon  cooperative interactions among herpesviruses, specific pathogenic bacteria and tissue-destructive inflammatory mediators. This study sought to identify associations among human cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and six putative periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontitis patients (nine with aggressive periodontitis and six with chronic periodontitis) and 15 periodontally normal subjects were included in the study. In each study subject, a microbiological sample was collected, using a curette, from the deepest periodontal probing depth of the dentition. A real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay was employed to determine the subgingival counts of human cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test, the Pearson correlation coefficient test and the single variable logistic regression test for odds ratio-based risk calculation. RESULTS: Human cytomegalovirus was detected in eight periodontitis lesions and in one normal periodontal site, Epstein-Barr virus was detected in nine periodontitis lesions and in two normal periodontal sites, and the study bacteria were detected in 6-15 periodontitis lesions and in 1-11 normal periodontal sites. Correlations were found between counts of human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, between counts of human cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and C. rectus, and between counts of Epstein-Barr virus and P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus counts were also positively associated with the level of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and gingival bleeding on probing. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that periodontal human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are associated with major periodontopathic bacteria and with the severity of periodontal disease. The finding of abundant herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions redefines the pathogenic paradigm of the disease. Understanding the interplay between herpesviruses and specific bacterial species in the pathogenesis of periodontitis may form the basis for new approaches to preventing, reducing or delaying tissue breakdown from periodontal infections.
TI  - Effect of photo-activated disinfection on endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  - AIM: To test the hypothesis that photo-activated disinfection (PAD) has a bactericidal effect on pathogens inoculated in root canals, with emphasis on biofilm formation/destruction. METHODOLOGY: Root canals of extracted teeth (n = 38) were prepared (size 30, 0.10 taper), autoclaved, divided into three groups and two negative controls inoculated (Streptococcus anginosus, Enterococcus faecalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum) and treated (PAD, laser, dye or positive control) according to a cross-sectional design. Resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of cell structural changes using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentinal surfaces (n = 22, two controls) before (1, 2 and 6 days of incubation) and after treatment with PAD. RESULTS: Treatment of root canals with PAD (15 J) caused a significant reduction of the bacterial load, resulting in a 93.8% kill of S. anginosus (P < 0.0001), a 88.4% kill of E. faecalis (P < 0.05) and a 98.5% kill of F. nucleatum (P < 0.0001), but no sterilization. Laser alone had no significant effect on the load nor did the dye without laser. The ESEM experiment showed that individual cells or monolayers were easily eliminated with PAD. But when biofilms were present (2 and 6 days for E. faecalis, 6 days for S. anginosus), bacterial eradication was substantially reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: Photo-activated disinfection is not an alternative but a possible supplement to the existing protocols for root canal disinfection as the interaction between light (diode laser) and associated dye (TBO) provides a broad-spectrum effect. Some endodontic pathogens that grow as single-species biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - Analysis of the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used for dental analgesia.
AB  - Seven local anaesthetics and their active anaesthetic components [Ultracaine D-S  (articaine hydrochloride), Carbostesin (bupivacaine hydrochloride), Scandicaine (mepivacaine hydrochloride), Xylonest (prilocaine hydrochloride), Xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride), Hostacaine (butanilicaine phosphate) and Novocaine (procaine hydrochloride)] were tested for their antimicrobial activity against 311 bacterial strains from 52 different species and 14 Candida albicans strains. The tested pathogens were members of the oral flora, and partly members of the skin and intestinal flora. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium disulfite, adrenaline hydrogen tartrate and adrenaline (the preservative and vasoconstrictive components of the anaesthetics) was tested. For determination of MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the agar dilution method using Wilkins-Chalgren agar was applied. The trade preparation Ultracaine D-S showed the most prominent antimicrobial activity with regard to both MIC and MBC. Ultracaine D-S and its active substance, articaine hydrochloride, showed similar MIC values, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity is mainly caused by the anaesthetic component. Novocaine showed the lowest antimicrobial activity and did not inhibit 35 of the species tested. The MIC values of all local anaesthetics were between 0.25 and 16 mg ml(-1). The routinely applied concentration of Ultracaine D-S was roughly four times higher, and of Hostacaine was two times higher, than the MBC values for the tested bacteria, whereas for the other anaesthetics, the MBC values were not reached or exceeded with the concentrations used. The MIC range of the preservatives was 0.5-1.0 mg ml(-1) for methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.2-0.5 mg ml(-1) for sodium disulfite. The articaine MIC values were two to three serial dilution steps lower, and the butanilicaine MIC values one to two serial dilution steps lower, than the MIC of the preservatives. The mepivacaine mean MIC values were slightly lower for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Staphylococcus aureus, but higher for Streptococcus intermedius, compared with the preservative methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. The same result was found with Streptococcus intermedius and lidocaine. Screening of 20 MIC values of 4 pure anaesthetic substances and the corresponding preservative found 2/20 instances where the MICs of the preservatives against 5 representative species (67 strains) were lower, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was mainly due to the preservative, but 18/20 results where the pure anaesthetic component showed greater antimicrobial effects compared with the preservative. The in vitro results for Carbostesin, Scandicaine and especially for Novocaine indicate that a local disinfection should be done prior to injection of the anaesthetics. Due to the results obtained with nosocomial strains (Escherichia coli, S. aureus and Pseudomonas), disinfection of the mucous membranes should be performed routinely in immunocompromised patients, regardless of the anaesthetic used.
TI  - Effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on subgingival periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the nature and amount of supragingival plaque can influence the composition of the contiguous subgingival flora. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil antimicrobial mouthrinse on levels of representative subgingival bacteria in subjects with mild to moderate periodontitis. METHODS: This controlled study used a randomized, double-masked, 2 x 2 crossover design. After baseline subgingival sampling, 37 qualifying subjects rinsed with the essential oil mouthrinse or a negative control twice daily for 14 days, with a post-treatment sample obtained on day 15. Following a washout period, the procedure was repeated with the alternative rinse. Target organisms enumerated were Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella sp., and total anaerobes. Intergroup comparisons of post-treatment log-transformed colony forming unit counts were made using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: After 14 days of twice-daily rinsing, the level of each of the target subgingival organisms was significantly lower in the essential oil group than in the control group (P < 0.001), with percent reductions ranging from 66.3% to 79.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Rinsing with the essential oil antiplaque/antigingivitis mouthrinse can have significant antimicrobial activity against subgingival periodontopathogens. Most likely, the antimicrobial effect was mediated primarily by disruption of the contiguous supragingival plaque by the mouthrinse. Because studies have shown that control of supragingival plaque can influence the onset and/or progression of periodontitis, additional studies on non-prescription antimicrobial oral care products may lead to new regimens for decreasing the burden of periodontal diseases in the population.
TI  - Early soft tissue healing around one-stage dental implants: clinical and microbiologic parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the potential significance of early soft tissue healing to long-term outcomes, this aspect of one-stage dental implants has not been investigated. The purpose of this prospective study was to characterize clinical and microbiologic parameters of early soft tissue healing around dental implants placed following a one-stage protocol. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (11 females and 10 males, aged 18 to 78 years; two smokers) needing a single implant were included. Clinical parameters included probing depth, buccal flap thickness, papilla height, and bleeding on probing. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained pre- and postoperatively and analyzed using molecular techniques. RESULTS: The newly formed peri-implant sulcus probing depth remained fairly stable from 4 to 12 weeks (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant association between flap thickness or papillary height and number of implant bleeding sites at 12 weeks (P > 0.05). Detection of known periodontal pathogens was rare. Fusobacterium nucleatum was present in 17 patients prior to surgery, and 71% of them became carriers of this bacterium at the implant site by the second postoperative week. The number of F. nucleatum-positive subjects around the implant was significantly lower than the number of F. nucleatum-positive subjects around teeth (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Peri-implant soft tissue clinical maturity may be established as early as 4 weeks following implant placement by a one-stage surgical protocol; neither preexisting flap thickness nor papillary height seemed to influence newly forming peri-implant sulcus depth or bleeding on probing prevalence. For the most part, the newly created peri-implant crevices were colonized by specific bacteria within 2 weeks.
TI  - Effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of Enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  - This in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of Enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of E. faecalis to dentin. The ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. Fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. Results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than E. faecalis. The hydrophobicity of E. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). The adherence of E. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. It was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of E. faecalis to dentin. The findings from this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.
TI  - [Case report: positive signals from automated blood-culture system with negative  direct Gram examination].
AB  - Detection of positive haemoculture is usually managed by an automated system. When a bottle is detected positive but that the Gram coloration does not reveal germs by direct examination, transfer onto chocolate blood agar generally allows to confirm or infirm bacteraemia. In light of a case of Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteraemia, we discuss the opportunity of pairing it with an enrichment broth. M. N, hospitalized in the hepatogastroenterology department, runs a fever of undetermined origin. Three pairs of blood samples are collected on May 7th, 2004, another pair on May 9th, 2004 and a last pair on May 10th, 2004. They are incubated in a Bactec 9120 analyzer. A positive signal is detected in the two last anaerobic haemocultures pairs after four days of incubation, but in both cases, the Gram coloration does not bring germs to light. A systematic transfer of the broth onto chocolate blood agar with incubation under CO2 enriched atmosphere and anaerobiosis is carried out. After 24 hours, the solid media remain sterile. The samples found positive by the Bactec(TM) are then transferred onto Schaedler broth in order to favour a potential growth of fastidious germs. The culture will prove to be positive only in this enrichment medium, allowing the identification of F. nucleatum. An hepatic abscess will then be revealed in the patient. It thus appears judicious to associate an enrichment medium with transplanted solid medium when the context is evocative of a real infection (clinic, positivity delays...).
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine/thymol and fluoride varnishes on dental biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of chlorhexidine/thymol (CHX/T) and fluoride (F)  varnishes on biofilm formation in vitro. Hydroxyapatite discs coated with varnish were first immersed in saline for 0, 3, 7 or 14 d, then immersed in pasteurized saliva. The discs were incubated for 20 h with a bacterial suspension containing Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, and Veillonella dispar. Uncoated discs were used as controls. Growth of bacteria on the discs was evaluated by culture and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacterial vitality was examined by fluorescence staining. In the CHX/T-treated group, bacterial accumulation was delayed, and the total number of bacteria was significantly lower than in the controls. In the F-treated group, the total number of bacteria did not differ from the control, although the number of S. oralis was lower. Bacterial vitality in the CHX/T and F groups did not differ from that in the controls. The total number of bacteria on the CHX/T-treated discs immersed in saline was significantly higher than that on the non-immersed discs. Biofilm development was inhibited by the CHX/T varnish but not by the F varnish. The effect of the CHX/T varnish decreased following the immersion of discs in saline.
TI  - Soluble CD14 discriminates slight structural differences between lipid as that lead to distinct host cell activation.
AB  - Soluble CD14 (sCD14) in serum is known to sensitize host cells to LPS. In the present study, the contributions of sCD14 and LPS-binding protein to a lipid A moiety from LPS preparations of periodontopathogenic Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were compared with that of Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506). F. nucleatum lipid A was identified to be a hexa-acylated fatty acid composed of tetradecanoate (C(14)) and hexadecanoate (C(16)), similar to dodecanoate (C(12)) and C(14) in compound 506. The two lipid A specimens exhibited nearly the same reactivity in Limulus amoebocyte lysate assays, though F. nucleatum lipid A showed a weaker lethal toxicity. Both lipid A specimens showed nearly the same activities toward host cells in the absence of FBS, though compound 506 exhibited much stronger activity in the presence of FBS, sCD14, or sCD14 together with LPS-binding protein. Furthermore, native PAGE/Western immunoblot assays demonstrated that F. nucleatum lipid A had a weaker binding to sCD14 as compared with compound 506. These results suggest that sCD14 is able to discriminate the slight structural differences between these lipid As, which causes their distinct host cell activation activities.
TI  - [The development and in vitro experiment study of a bio-type root canal filling sealer using calcium phosphate cement].
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop a novel root canal filling sealers based on calcium phosphate cement (CPC), and to evaluate its physical-chemical properties and in vitro antibacterial activity on the predominant bacteria infecting root canal. METHODS: The fluidity and the setting time of the sealer were tested according to ISO 6876:2001(E) standards. The crystal size of the final product was determined. Its opacification with different composition were measured. The in vitro antibacterial property of the sealer was tested according to the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Anaerobes recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLs). The involved bacteria included Actinomyces naeslundii(A. naeslundii), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P. anaerobius), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Porphyromonas endodpntalis (P. endodpntalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Twenty single-rooted human extracted teeth were selected to evaluate the sealing ability using dye microleakage technology. Dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed using SPSS12.0 software package. RESULTS: The new root canal filling sealer was primarily composed of hydroxyapatite in 279 nm after setting. Its liquidity was suitable, the operating time was over 30 minutes, and the controlled setting time was (1.0+/-0.5) hours. The opacification was acceptable. MIC<or=0.156-0.312. The dye penetration was significant different between two filling types (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The new root canal filling sealer is an ideal root canal filling sealer.

TI  - The inhibition of dentifrice containing the lotus leaf-derived inhibitor on periodontitis-related bacteria in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To search for a substance in lotus leaf that could efficiently be used in toothpaste for preventing periodontal disease. METHODS: Dried lotus leaves were hydrated and fractionated using 40% butanol and 40% ethanol extraction. The extracts and the residue were evaluated by antimicrobial sensitivity tests of broth micro-dilution methods on 96-microwell plates for inhibition of five species of oral bacteria: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Actinomyces viscosus 19246, Porphyromonas gingivalis 33277, Fusobacterium nucleatum 25586, and Actinomyces naeslundii wvl 45. The most active antimicrobial extract was then ready to use in toothpaste. A water extract of the toothpaste was prepared and its inhibitory activity tested. The potency of the lotus leaf extracts was compared to inhibition observed by three commercially available toothpastes. RESULTS: The butanol-extracted material was separated into four fractions on silica gel. Fraction #3, the fraction containing the most potent inhibitor, was formulated into toothpaste. The toothpaste containing the extract showed an inhibition effect on suspicious peridontitis-causing bacteria. CONCLUSION: An extract from the lotus leaf is effective in inhibiting peridontitis-causing bacteria. The toothpaste containing the lotus leaf-derived inhibitor could be useful in preventing periodontal disease.
TI  - Involvement of phospholipase D in regulating expression of anti-microbial peptide human beta-defensin-2.
AB  - Human beta-defensin expression correlates with differentiation in oral epithelium, and calcium ion, an important regulator of epithelial differentiation, plays a critical role in regulation of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) mRNA expression. Phospholipase D (PLD) also regulates epithelial differentiation. Therefore, we examined the role of PLD in hBD-2 up-regulation by cell wall extract of Fusobacterium nucleatum and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), two known hBD-2 activators. We found that hBD-2 mRNA up-regulation in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) by these two activators was mediated by PLD activation and blocked by ethanol and 1-butanol, PLD inhibitors. PLD activity was induced by stimulation with these two activators, and phosphatidic acid (PA), a product generated from the PLD enzymatic activity, was detected in stimulated HGECs. Dioctanoyl PA commonly used for PA induced hBD-2 mRNA expression. mRNAs for PLD1 alpha and beta splice variants as well as PLD1 protein were constitutively expressed, whereas mRNA and protein for PLD2 were expressed at much lower levels than those for PLD1. Moreover, pre-treatment with (+/-)-propanolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolases that are the downstream signaling molecules in the PLD pathway, significantly blocked hBD-2 mRNA induction by PMA in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings indicate the involvement of PLD activation in hBD-2 up-regulation in HGECs, which correlates with the state of epithelial differentiation.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (RCM) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. STUDY DESIGN: The antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted and tested against anaerobic bacteria Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii, and Clostridium perfringens and against Enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL standardized inocula. The tubes were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. Blood agar RCM subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. The results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. RESULTS: All drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. E. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and RCM broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. Ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of EEP.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of cranberry polyphenol on biofilm formation and cysteine proteases of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cranberry polyphenol fraction on biofilm formation and activities of Arg-gingipain and Lys-gingipain in Porphyromonas gingivalis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The polyphenol fraction was prepared by using a glass column packed with Amberlite XAD 7HP and 70% aqueous ethanol as an elution solvent. RESULTS: Synergistic biofilm formation by P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly inhibited by the polyphenol fraction at a concentration of 250 microg/mL compared with untreated controls (p < 0.01). Arg-gingipain and Lys-gingipain activities in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and FDC 381 were inhibited significantly at a polyphenol fraction concentration of > or = 1 microg/mL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the polyphenol fraction inhibits biofilm formation and the Arg-gingipain and Lys-gingipain activities of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. Differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HOK-16B cells were cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. The levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, LL-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. In the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. In contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. In addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. CONCLUSION: The nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells, which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.
TI  - Antimicrobial profiles of Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from periodontal infections in a selected area of southern Italy.
AB  - In view of the increasing antibiotic resistance of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, we determined the antimicrobial profile of 55 periodontal anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria correlated with human infections, comprising 16 strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 39 strains of Prevotella spp. isolated from periodontal pockets of 26 adults suffering from chronic periodontitis. All the strains of F. nucleatum were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, doxycycline, metronidazole, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, whilst 2/16 strains were both resistant to amoxicillin and beta-lactamase-positive and 11/16 were resistant to clarithromycin. All of the Prevotella strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, doxycycline and metronidazole, whereas 7/39 strains were beta-lactamase-positive and resistant to amoxicillin, 5/39 were resistant to clarithromycin and 3/39 were resistant to both moxifloxacin and levofloxacin. Our findings confirm that there is an increasing need to encourage practitioners to use laboratory investigations to limit the risk of an incorrect therapeutic approach and to avoid the overuse of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. However, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) origins is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. To minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. METHODS: GeneScan-1000 ROX was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (MW) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16S recombinant RNA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of the conventional method. Microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new MW size definition. Bacterial species were assigned to peaks using TRFMA, a Web-based tool for T-RFLP analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. RESULTS: Using the new size definition, the average sizing error for 40 T-RFs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. More than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by T-RFLP. CONCLUSION: The size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the T-RFLP analysis. This provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Compressed mints and chewing gum containing magnolia bark extract are effective against bacteria responsible for oral malodor.
AB  - Flavors and natural botanic extracts are often used in chewing gum and compressed mints for breath freshening and relief of oral malodor. The oral malodor is a result of bacterial putrification of proteinaceous materials from food or saliva. In this study, magnolia bark extract (MBE) and its two main components, magnolol and honokiol, were evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) test. The inhibitory effect of MBE mint was further evaluated by a kill-time assay study. In addition, an in vivo study was performed on nine healthy volunteers postlunch. Saliva samples were taken before and after subjects consumed mints and gum, with and without MBE. Listerine mouthwash was included as a positive control. The testing results indicated that MBE and its two main constituents demonstrated a strong germ-kill effect against bacteria responsible for halitosis and also Streptococcus mutans, bacteria involved in dental caries formation. The MIC of magnolol, honokiol, and MBE on Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and S. mutans ranged from 8 to 31 microg/mL. Kill-time assay results indicated that mints containing 0.2% MBE reduced more than 99.9% of three oral bacteria within 5 min of treatment. The in vivo study demonstrated that MBE containing mints reduced total salivary bacteria by 61.6% at 30 min and 33.8% at 60 min postconsumption. In comparison, the flavorless mint reduced total salivary bacteria by 3.6% at 30 min and increased total bacteria by 47.9% at 60 min. The MBE containing chewing gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 43.0% at 40 min, while placebo gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 18.0%. In conclusion, MBE demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against organisms responsible for oral malodor and can be incorporated in compressed mints and chewing gum for improved breath-freshening benefits.
TI  - Bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface of premachined or cast components.
AB  - In recent clinical studies, contamination of the inner parts of dental implants through bacterial penetration along the implant components has been observed. The aim of the present in-vitro study was to investigate leakage of Fusobacterium nucleatum through the interface between implants and premachined or cast abutments. Both premachined (n=10) and cast (n=10) implant-abutment assemblies were inoculated with 3.0 microL of microbial inoculum. The assemblies were completely immersed in 5.0 mL of tryptic soy broth culture medium to observe leakage at the implant-abutment interface after 14 days of anaerobic incubation. Bacterial growth in the medium, indicative of microbial leakage, was found only in 1 out of 9 samples (11.1%) in each group. Both premachined and cast abutments connected to external hexagonal implants provide low percentages of bacterial leakage through the interface in in vitro unloaded conditions if the manufacturer's instructions and casting procedures are properly followed.
TI  - The trimeric periplasmic chaperone Skp of Escherichia coli forms 1:1 complexes with outer membrane proteins via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.
AB  - The interactions of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) with the periplasmic chaperone Skp from Escherichia coli are not well understood. We have examined the binding of Skp to various OMPs of different origin, size, and function. These were OmpA, OmpG, and YaeT (Omp85) from Escherichia coli, the translocator domain of the autotransporter NalP from Neisseria meningitides, FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel, human isoform 1 (hVDAC1) from mitochondria. Binding of Skp was observed for bacterial OMPs, but neither for hVDAC1 nor for soluble bovine serum albumin. The Skp trimer formed 1:1 complexes, OMP.Skp(3), with bacterial OMPs, independent of their size or origin. The dissociation constants of these OMP.Skp(3) complexes were all in the nanomolar range, indicating that they are stable. Complexes of Skp(3) with YaeT displayed the smallest dissociation constants, complexes with NalP the largest. OMP binding to Skp(3) was pH-dependent and not observed when either Skp or OMPs were neutralized at very basic or very acidic pH. When the ionic strength was increased, the free energies of binding of Skp to OmpA or OmpG were reduced. Electrostatic interactions were therefore necessary for formation and stability of OMP.Skp(3) complexes. Light-scattering and circular dichroism experiments demonstrated that Skp(3) remained a stable trimer from pH 3 to pH 11. In the OmpA.Skp(3) complex, Skp efficiently shielded tryptophan residues of the transmembrane strands of OmpA against fluorescence quenching by aqueous acrylamide. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, bound to OmpA.Skp(3) complexes at low stoichiometries. Acrylamide quenching of fluorescence indicated that in this ternary complex, the tryptophan residues of the transmembrane domain of OmpA were located closer to the surface than in binary OmpA.Skp(3) complexes. This may explain previous observations that folding of Skp-bound OmpA into lipid bilayers is facilitated in presence of LPS.
TI  - Implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. Twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. Before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. After implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. Periodontal pathogens such as Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. Surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. Foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. Although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of triclosan and triclosan with Gantrez on five common endodontic pathogens.
AB  - Microbial control of the root canal system is one of the key objectives of root canal therapy. Triclosan is a widely accepted broad spectrum antimicrobial agent proven to be effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Triclosan acts by blocking bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. The addition of Gantrez copolymer has been shown to enhance the antimicrobial activity of triclosan. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of triclosan and triclosan with Gantrez against Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both test solutions was determined for each of the 5 microorganisms by using microtiter serial dilutions. Samples were streaked on 5% sheep blood agar plates and placed in an anaerobic incubator to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The MBC of triclosan ranged from 12-94 microg/mL. The MBC of triclosan with Gantrez ranged from <0.3-10.4 microg/mL. The addition of Gantrez enhanced the bactericidal activity of triclosan. Both triclosan and triclosan with Gantrez demonstrated bactericidal activity against the 5 specific endodontic pathogens.
TI  - [Application of "Microring AN" to "Level 1": presumptive identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - Commonly isolated anaerobic gram-negative rods (4 genus 64 strains), some other important gram-negative anaerobic species (9 genus 45 strains), and cigar-shaped clostridia (11 strains) were studied on their susceptibility patterns to 6 agents on "Microring AN". Some modifications were made in the methods and interpretation of results. Susceptibility patterns to erythromycin, rifampicin, colistin, benzylpenicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin were following (sensitive [S], intermediate [I], resistant [R], variable [V]): for Bacteroides fragilis group, V, S, R, R, R, R, respectively; for non-pigmented Prevotella, V, S, V, V, R, R, respectively; for pigmented Prevotella, S, S, SR, V, V, R, respectively: for Fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, R(S), S(I), S(IR), S(R), S, R, respectively; and for F. varium, R, R, S/I, R(S), S, R, respectively. Some results were different from that in the data table in the instruction of "Microring AN", because of differences of methodology and changes of susceptibility of those species during years. As to the other groups, that are not included in the data table in the instruction, results were following: for Bilophila wadsworthia, R, R, S, R, S, R, respectively; Desulfovibrio, V, R(S), R, R, S, R, respectively; for cigar-shaped clostridia, V, S(R), R, R, S(R), S, respectively. "Microring AN" was useful for presumptive identification in genus, species, or group level, though morphological observation and some additional simple tests such as bile-sensitivity and catalase were essential.
TI  - Comparison of growth and susceptibility to sodium hypochlorite of mono- and dual-species biofilms of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus (micromonas) micros.
AB  - This study compared growth and susceptibility to different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) of mono- and dual-species biofilms of Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus micros in vitro at 24 hours or 96 hours. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that although at 24 hours dual-species biofilms had similar viable counts to those of monospecies biofilms (p > 0.001), they were more resistant to NaOCl (p < 0.001). At 96 hours, both microorganisms had higher viable counts and were more resistant to NaOCl in dual-species biofilms than in monospecies biofilms of the same microorganism (p < 0.001). As the age of the biofilms increased, so did their resistance to NaOCl. Mixed-species biofilms of F. nucleatum and P. micros showed a time-dependent synergy in growth and resistance to NaOCl.
TI  - Functionalization of PVDF membranes with carbohydrate derivates for the controlled delivery of chlorhexidin.
AB  - Maltodextrin (MX) was fixed onto PVDF membranes in order to create a drug delivery Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) device with controlled drug delivery properties. PVDF microporous membranes were treated by a mixture of MX and citric acid, resulting to an 18 wt% increase of the supports. MX grafted membrane could capture 103 mg/g chlorhexidin digluconate (DigCHX) instead of 1mg/g for a virgin membrane. A neutralization step was performed before the biological tests. Viability tests confirmed the non-toxicity of the MX polymer coating after neutralisation. In vitro release test in human plasma, and microbiological tests showed that membranes grafted with MX were more performing compared to virgin and beta-CD grafted membranes. The antimicrobial activity was effective during more than 72 h.
TI  - The impact of a low-frequency chlorhexidine rinsing schedule on the subgingival microbiota (the TEETH clinical trial).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the efficacy of chlorhexidine (CHX) rinsing on the subgingival microbiota is limited. This study tested if intermittent CHX rinsing over 5 years had an impact on the subgingival microbiota. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method in a double-blind randomized CHX rinse study. RESULTS: A total of 210 subjects were included. The mean age of the subjects was 71.7 (+/- 4.1) years, and 56.2% were women. Evidence of alveolar bone loss was found in 39% of subjects. Bacterial loads were not correlated significantly with probing depth. At year 5, subjects in the CHX rinse group with no evidence of bone loss presented with lower total bacterial counts than control subjects with no bone loss. The levels of the following bacteria were significantly lower in the CHX group: Lactobacillus acidophilus (P <0.05), Eikenella corrodens (P <0.05), Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum (P <0.01), Treponema denticola (P <0.05), Leptotrichia buccalis (P <0.05), and Eubacterium saburreum (P <0.05). No differences in bacterial loads were found between CHX and control rinse subjects with alveolar bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Older subjects with or without periodontitis carry a large variety of bacteria associated with periodontitis. Intermittent rinsing with CHX may provide a preventive benefit in reducing levels of bacteria but only in subjects without alveolar bone loss.
TI  - Hemoglobin and LPS act in synergy to amplify the inflammatory response.
AB  - Vascular disruption and bleeding during periodontitis likely increase the levels  of hemoglobin in gingival crevicular fluid. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hemoglobin on the inflammatory responses of human macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from periodontopathogens. The production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by macrophages following challenges with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum LPS in the presence or absence of human hemoglobin was analyzed by ELISA. The effect of hemoglobin on LPS-binding to macrophages was evaluated with (3)H-LPS. Hemoglobin and LPS from periodontopathogens acted in synergy to stimulate the production of high levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha by macrophages. Hemoglobin also enhanced LPS-binding to macrophages. This study suggests that hemoglobin contributes to increases in the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in periodontal sites by acting in synergy with LPS from periodontopathogens, thus favoring the progression of periodontitis.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum induces fetal death in mice via stimulation of TLR4-mediated placental inflammatory response.
AB  - Intrauterine infection plays a pivotal role in preterm birth (PTB) and is characterized by inflammation. Currently, there is no effective therapy available to treat or prevent bacterial-induced PTB. Using Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobe frequently associated with PTB, as a model organism, the mechanism of intrauterine infection was investigated. Previously, it was shown that F. nucleatum induced preterm and term stillbirth in mice. Fusobacterial-induced placental infection was characterized by localized bacterial colonization, inflammation, and necrosis. In this study, F. nucleatum was shown to activate both TLR2 and TLR4 in vitro. In vivo, the fetal death rate was significantly reduced in TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/6 TLR4(-/-) and C3H/HeJ (TLR4(d/d))), but not in TLR2-deficient mice (C57BL/6 TLR2(-/-)), following F. nucleatum infection. The reduced fetal death in TLR4-deficient mice was accompanied by decreased placental necroinflammatory responses in both C57BL/6 TLR4(-/-) and C3H/HeJ. Decreased bacterial colonization in the placenta was observed in C3H/HeJ, but not in C57BL/6 TLR4(-/-). These results suggest that inflammation, rather than the bacteria per se, was the likely cause of fetal loss. TLR2 did not appear to be critically involved, as no difference in bacterial colonization, inflammation, or necrosis was observed between C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 TLR2(-/-) mice. A synthetic TLR4 antagonist, TLR4A, significantly reduced fusobacterial-induced fetal death and decidual necrosis without affecting the bacterial colonization in the placentas. TLR4A had no bactericidal activity nor did it affect the birth outcome in sham-infected mice. TLR4A could have promise as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment or prevention of bacterial-induced preterm birth.
TI  - Effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGI) and microfilled composite (MC) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. METHODS: Fifty-four periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (N = 18), root exposure (RE) without non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) treated with coronally positioned flap (CPF); group 2 (N = 18), RE with NCCL treated RMGI restorations plus CPF; group 3 (N = 18), RE with NCCL treated with MC restorations plus CPF. Probing depth (PD), visible local plaque score (PL), and local bleeding on probing (BOP) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. Restored and non-restored root recoverage (RR) was assessed at 6 months. Each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding PL, BOP, and PD at baseline and 6 months. The RR means were similar among the groups at 6 months. Intragroup analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. For the RMGI group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. For the MC group, there was a significant increase in the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and Gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. Intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of F. nucleatum polymorphum for the MC group. CONCLUSIONS: In a 6-month evaluation, well-finished RMGI or MC subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. Furthermore, RMGI seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than MC.
TI  - Genome sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum - a genetically tractable fusobacterium.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a prominent member of the oral microbiota and is a common cause of human infection. F. nucleatum includes five subspecies: polymorphum, nucleatum, vincentii, fusiforme, and animalis. F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953 has been well characterized phenotypically and, in contrast to previously sequenced strains, is amenable to gene transfer. We sequenced and annotated the 2,429,698 bp genome of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953. Plasmid pFN3 from the strain was also sequenced and analyzed. When compared to the other two available fusobacterial genomes (F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii) 627 open reading frames unique to F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953 were identified. A large percentage of these mapped within one of 28 regions or islands containing five or more genes. Seventeen percent of the clustered proteins that demonstrated similarity were most similar to proteins from the clostridia, with others being most similar to proteins from other gram-positive organisms such as Bacillus and Streptococcus. A ten kilobase region homologous to the Salmonella typhimurium propanediol utilization locus was identified, as was a prophage and integrated conjugal plasmid. The genome contains five composite ribozyme/transposons, similar to the CdISt IStrons described in Clostridium difficile. IStrons are not present in the other fusobacterial genomes. These findings indicate that F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum is proficient at horizontal gene transfer and that exchange with the Firmicutes, particularly the Clostridia, is common.
TI  - Targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - An in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. In this study, a quantitative Taqman PCR assay (QPCR) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species in the formation of the oral biofilm. In addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. With this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16S rDNA sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. Among the target organisms were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Micromonas micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Tannerella forsythensis, and Veillonella parvula. Primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. The relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. Brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. This new broad spectrum QPCR assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - [Lemierre syndrome].
AB  
TI  - Development of a genus-specific PCR assay for the molecular detection, confirmation and identification of Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - A genus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay is developed for the detection and identification of clinically relevant Fusobacterium species, including F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum. Two 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) primers, FUSO1 (forward primer: 5'-GAG AGA GCT TTG CGT CC-3' [17-mer]) and FUSO 2 (reverse primer: 5'-TGG GCG CTG AGG TTC GAC -3' [18-mer]) are designed to target conserved regions of the 16S rDNA gene for Fusobacterium spp. Subsequent proof-of-principle studies employing this assay detected Fusobacterium spp. in the faeces of eight (10%) out of 80 patients with suspected gastrointestinal infection. This assay may be used for the genus-specific detection of Fusobacterium spp. from clinical specimens and for subsequent species identification.
TI  - The effect of mineral trioxide aggregate on phagocytic activity and production of reactive oxygen, nitrogen species and arginase activity by M1 and M2 macrophages.
AB  - AIM: To assess the influence of co-culture with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)  on phagocytosis and the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and nitrogen (NO) species and the arginase activity by M1 and M2 peritoneal macrophages. METHODOLOGY: Cellular viability, adherence and phagocytosis of Saccharomyces boulardii were assayed in the presence of MTA. Macrophages were stimulated with zymosan for ROI assays and with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and IFN-gamma for NO production and arginase activity, when in contact with capillaries containing MTA. Data were analysed by T, anova, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: M2 macrophages displayed greater cellular viability in polypropylene tubes, greater ability to ingest yeast and smaller production of ROI and higher arginase activity when compared with M1 macrophages. Both macrophages, M1 and M2, presented similar cell adherence and NO production. The addition of bacterial preparations to macrophages interfered with NO and arginase productions. MTA did not interfere with any of the parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Phagocytosis and the ability of the two macrophage subtypes to eliminate microbes were not affected by MTA.
TI  - Femoral vein thrombophlebitis and septic pulmonary embolism due to a mixed anaerobic infection including Solobacterium moorei: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary foci of necrobacillosis infection outside the head and neck are uncommon but have been reported in the urogenital or gastrointestinal tracts. Reports of infection with Solobacterium moorei are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old male intravenous drug user was admitted with pain in his right groin, fever, rigors and vomiting following a recent injection into the right femoral vein. Admission blood cultures grew Fusobacterium nucleatum, Solobacterium moorei and Bacteroides ureolyticus. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous penicillin and metronidazole. CONCLUSION: This case report describes an unusual case of femoral thrombophlebitis with septic pulmonary embolism associated with anaerobic organisms in a groin abscess. Solobacterium moorei, though rarely described, may also have clinically significant pathogenic potential.
TI  - Cultivable bacteria in infected root canals as identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, cultivable bacteria isolated from infected root canals have been identified by phenotype-based methods. Because 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing has emerged as a more accurate and reliable tool for bacterial identification, the present study applied this approach to identify bacterial isolates recovered from the root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. METHODS: Anaerobic techniques were used for culturing; identification of the isolates was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the V5-V8 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Bacteria were found in all samples. The mean number of taxa per canal was 3.1, ranging from 2 to 8. The median number of cultivable bacterial cells in the root canals was 4.2 x 10(5), ranging from 2.8 x 10(3) to 3.3 x 10(7). Eighty-seven strains belonging to 52 bacterial taxa were identified. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Micromonas micros and streptococci. The following bacterial phyla were represented in this study: Firmicutes (22 taxa, 46% of the identified isolates), Actinobacteria (14 taxa, 25.3% of the isolates), Bacteroidetes (eight taxa, 13.8% of the isolates), Fusobacteria (three taxa, 9.2% of the isolates) and Proteobacteria (five taxa, 5.7% of the isolates). Some of the isolates represented unnamed species not previously cultivated and characterized. In conclusion, our findings using a combined anaerobic culture-molecular identification approach confirmed the polymicrobial nature of primary endodontic infections with dominance of anaerobic bacteria. Notably several bacteria that are difficult or impossible to identify by phenotypic means were identified, including previously uncultivated taxa, cultivated-but-not-yet-characterized taxa and newly named species.
TI  - Association of a high-molecular weight arginine-binding protein of Fusobacterium  nucleatum ATCC 10953 with adhesion to secretory immunoglobulin A and coaggregation with Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregates with a diverse range of bacterial species, and binds to host tissues and proteins such as immunoglobulin. These interactions may support the attachment of a variety of organisms to oral surfaces and can facilitate the invasion of soft tissues. We hypothesized that coaggregation with streptococci and immunoglobulin binding may occur by a common adhesin sensitive to l-arginine. METHODS: Repeated mixing of F. nucleatum with non-immune secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) and recovery of non-agglutinating cells isolated a spontaneous mutant (isolate 21) of F. nucleatum that was defective in S-IgA binding. Wild-type and mutant F. nucleatum were compared by coaggregation and adhesion assays. RESULTS: Isolate 21 exhibited significantly reduced S-IgA binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci but not with Porphyromonas gingivalis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant was deficient compared to wild-type for a single protein of approximately 360 kilodaltons. The corresponding protein was isolated from wild-type F. nucleatum protein preparations by coprecipitation with arginine-agarose beads. This protein was able to bind both Streptococcus cristatus and S-IgA. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that this protein was closely related to putative autotransporter proteins in other F. nucleatum strains and was a 100% match to the deduced amino acid sequence of a 10,638-base-pair open reading frame in the incomplete genome sequence of F. nucleatum ATCC 10,953. Peptides identified by MS-MS analysis spanned most of the predicted amino acid sequence, suggesting that the mature protein is not subject to postsecretory cleavage. CONCLUSION: Coaggregation represents a novel function within the autotransporter class of proteins, which are often associated with virulence.
TI  - FadA from Fusobacterium nucleatum utilizes both secreted and nonsecreted forms for functional oligomerization for attachment and invasion of host cells.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including periodontal diseases and preterm birth. A novel FadA adhesin was recently identified for host-cell binding. It consists of 129 amino acid residues, with an 18-amino acid signal peptide. Expression of FadA in Escherichia coli enhanced bacterial binding to host epithelial and endothelial cells. In both E. coli and F. nucleatum, FadA exists in two forms, the intact pre-FadA and the secreted mature FadA (mFadA), with pre-FadA anchored in the inner membrane and mFadA secreted outside the bacteria. Pre-FadA and mFadA formed high M(r) complexes. When each form was purified to a single species, mFadA was soluble at neutral pH, whereas pre-FadA was insoluble. Pre-FadA became soluble when mixed with mFadA or under acidic pH. When fluorescence-labeled mFadA alone was added to the epithelial cells, no binding was detected. However, when mixed with nonlabeled pre-FadA, binding and invasion of mFadA into epithelial cells was observed. FadA is a unique bacterial adhesin/invasin in that it utilizes its own two forms for both structural and functional purposes. The pre-FadA-mFadA complex is probably anchored in the inner membrane and protrudes through the outer membrane. Internalization of the pre-FadA-mFadA ensures invasion of the bacteria into the host cells.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - Physiological alterations of a Fusobacterium nucleatum strain exposed to oxidative stress.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidative stress  on physiological and genetic characteristics of Fusobacterium nucleatum and its interference on this microbial identification methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fus. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum ATCC 25586 (wt-strain) and an oxidative-stress-adapted strain derived from the wt-strain (aero-strain) were employed in the study. Cell-free crude protein extracts were obtained from both strains and differentially expressed proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Bacterium identification was performed by conventional biochemical tests, automated Rapid ID 32A system and specific PCR analysis. Genetic diversity between wt- and aero-strain was assessed by arbitrarily-primed (AP)-PCR. There were significant changes in the protein profile of aero-strain. The identification of the wt-strain was confirmed by all methods employed. Similar results were obtained for aero-strain when conventional biochemical tests and PCR were used. However, aero-strain was identified as Fusobacterium varium when submitted to Rapid ID 32A system. According to AP-PCR analysis, no significant genetic alteration was detected in aero-strain. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptive response of Fus. nucleatum to oxidative stress is associated with changes on its biology, which may lead to misidentification of the organism, according to the conventional identification methods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Oxidative stress may act as a cause of adaptive response in Fus. nucleatum with consequences to its biology, such as alterations on biochemical and physiological profile.
TI  - Activation of protective responses in oral epithelial cells by Fusobacterium nucleatum and human beta-defensin-2.
AB  - Oral epithelia are constantly exposed to non-pathogenic (commensal) bacteria, but generally remain healthy and uninflamed. Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal bacterium, strongly induces human beta-defensin-2 (hBD2), an antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptide, in gingival epithelial cells (GECs). hBD2 is also expressed in normal oral tissue leading to the hypothesis that oral epithelia are in an activated state with respect to innate immune responses under normal in vivo conditions. In order to test this hypothesis, global gene expression was evaluated in GECs in response to stimulation by an F. nucleatum cell wall (FnCW) preparation and to hBD2 peptide. FnCW treatment altered 829 genes, while hBD2 altered 209 genes (P<0.005, ANOVA). Many induced genes were associated with the gene ontology categories of immune responses and defence responses. Consistent with the hypothesis, similar responses were activated by commensal bacteria and hBD2. These responses included up-regulation of common antimicrobial effectors and chemokines, and down-regulation of proliferation markers. In addition, FnCW up-regulated multiple protease inhibitors, and suppressed NF-kappaB function and the ubiquitin/proteasome system. These global changes may protect the tissue from inflammatory damage. Both FnCW and hBD2 also up-regulated genes that may enhance the epithelial barrier. The findings suggest that both commensal bacteria and hBD2 activate protective responses of GECs and play an important role in immune modulation in the oral cavity.
TI  - A novel TEM contrasting technique for extracellular polysaccharides in in vitro biofilms.
AB  - In the past, the visualization of the extracellular matrix of biofilms on an ultrastructural level was hampered by shrinkage artifacts. In addition, the reproducible contrasting of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) has not satisfactorily been solved. Here we describe a method overcoming these difficulties, which produces artifact-free transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images using multispecies biofilms grown in vitro. Sufficient contrast was achieved by replacing Schiff's reagent with the osmiophilic amino acid methionine. In addition, shrinkage was avoided by replacing the classical dehydration agents with ethylene glycol and 1,2-pentanediol. Applying this method provided images of biofilms with an intact matrix in which differentially contrasted bacteria were embedded. All six members of the biofilm consortium (Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus oralis, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Candida albicans) could be distinguished. Within the matrix, structural differences of EPS, probably due to different proportions of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linkages, were apparent. Fibrilar polysaccharides were evident around microcolonies of S. sobrinus, and fluffy polysaccharides were detected in the vicinity of S. oralis microcolonies. The ultrastructure of biofilms prepared for TEM using this method allows the imaging of undistorted EPS as well as the differentiated contrasting of the six microbial species of the in vitro biofilm model. This is a major step forward in determining the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms on an ultrastructural level.
TI  - Co-adhesion and biofilm formation by Fusobacterium nucleatum in response to growth pH.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic organism considered to play  an important role in the progression of periodontal disease and is commonly found in clinical infections of other body sites. Apart from its metabolic versatility, its cell-surface properties enable it to attach to epithelial cells, collagen, gingival epithelial cells and other bacterial genera, but not with other Fusobacteria. The development of periodontitis is associated with a rise in pH in the gingival sulcus to around 8.5, and this is thought to occur by the catabolism of proteins supplied by gingival crevicular fluid. F. nucleatum is commonly isolated from diseased sites and has also been shown to survive in root canal systems at pH 9.0 after Ca(OH)(2) treatment. In order to survive hostile environmental conditions, such as nutrient deprivation and fluctuating temperature and pH, bacteria form biofilms, which are usually made up of multi-species co-aggregates. We have grown F. nucleatum in a chemostat at a growth rate consistent with that of oral bacteria in vivo and report that, at a growth pH of 8.2, F. nucleatum co-adheres and forms a homogeneous biofilm. Cell-surface hydrophobicity was determined in planktonic and co-adhering cells to characterise the interfacial interactions associated with the response to pH. Cell-surface hydrophobicity was found to increase at pH 8.2 and this was also associated with a decrease in the levels of intracellular polyglucose (IP) and an observed change in the bacterial cell morphology. To our knowledge, these results represent the first study in which F. nucleatum has been shown to co-adhere and form a biofilm, which may be important in the organism's persistence during the transition from health to disease in vivo.
TI  - Bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. We investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the Buffalo, New York Women's Health Initiative Observational Study was conducted. Standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ACH). Subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. RESULTS: The most prevalent infection was Streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by Prevotella intermedia (43.4%), Tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), Capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), Eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), Campylobacter rectus (17.4%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). Infections with P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, P. intermedia, and C. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ACH, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. The body mass index (BMI) was a modifier of this association. Overweight women with T. forsythensis infection were more likely to have oral bone loss (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.08 to 5.46) than normal weight (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.20) women with T. forsythensis infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal women. Those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. Further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of BMI and/or inflammatory factors.
TI  - Effect of an essential oil-containing antimicrobial mouthrinse on specific plaque bacteria in vivo.
AB  - AIM: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on levels of specific supra and subgingival bacteria in subjects with gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen subjects meeting entry criteria completed this randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Subjects were required to have >or=1000 target organisms per millilitre in pooled samples from two subgingival sites. Following sampling of supra and subgingival plaque, subjects began twice-daily rinsing for 14 days with either an essential oil-containing mouthrinse (Cool Mint Listerine Antiseptic) or a negative control. Supra and subgingival plaque was again sampled on day 15, and the procedure repeated after a 1-week washout period with subjects using the alternate rinse. RESULTS: Compared with the negative control, the essential oil mouthrinse produced significant reductions in supragingival plaque levels of Veillonella sp., Capnocytophaga sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and total anaerobes ranging from 52.3 to 88.5% (p<0.001 except for Veillonella, p=0.002); respective reductions in subgingival plaque ranged from 54.1 to 69.1% (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rinsing with the essential oil mouthrinse can have an impact on the subgingival plaque flora. This study provides additional evidence indicating that reduction in supragingival plaque can reduce levels of subgingival plaque.
TI  - Odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in Spain.
AB  - Resistance in streptococci or Gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. Scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. The present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in Spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. Periodontal samples were prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. Species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Susceptibility was determined by E-test. A total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had Streptococcus oralis; 70.8% Streptococcus mitis; 60.4% Prevotella buccae; 39.6% Prevotella denticola; 37.5% Fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% Prevotella intermedia; 25% Capnocytophaga spp.; 23% Veillonella spp.; 22.9% Prevotella melaninogenica and Streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. Streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for S. sanguis to 47.7% for S. mitis. Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in P. buccae to 26.3% in P. denticola. Metronidazole resistance was <6% in all Prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-Lactamase production was positive in 54.1% Prevotella spp., 38.9% F. nucleatum, 30% Capnocytophaga spp., and 10% Veillonella spp. In this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.
TI  - Periodontal bacterial DNA suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  - Certain CpG motifs found in bacterial DNA enhance immune responses through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. Our objective was to determine if DNA from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral cavity. Streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (GTF), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. Rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-GTF, or alum-GTF together with either Escherichia coli DNA, Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA, or Porphyromonas gingivalis DNA. Contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-GTF plus bacterial DNA (P. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, salivary IgA antibody, and T-cell proliferation to GTF compared to animals immunized with alum-GTF alone. A diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-GTF with the P. gingivalis DNA either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and DNA was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. Since TLR triggering by DNA induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [SOCS]), the effects of P. gingivalis DNA and GTF exposure on rat splenocyte production of SOCS family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. P. gingivalis DNA significantly up-regulated SOCS1 and SOCS5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. These results suggested that DNA from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive SOCS components triggered by innate mechanisms.
TI  - Infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, SD+/-1.5). Forty species were identified by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. Periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. Implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. Neisseria mucosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. Implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of Eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, P<0.05), the levels of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, P<0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, P<0.05), and Micromonas micros (r=0.17, P=0.01). E. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (P<0.05). Subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (P<0.02) and N. mucosa (P<0.05). Independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of P. gingivalis (P<0.05), and Leptotrichia buccalis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.
TI  - Activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. Bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and/or TLR4. Accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of TLR2 as compared to TLR4 triggering. The aim was to study the interaction of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Veillonella parvula with TLR2 and TLR4. We investigated all known serotypes (K(-), K1-K6) of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. METHODS: Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, stably transfected with CD14, CD14-TLR2, or CD14-TLR4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. Cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: All test bacteria stimulated HEK-CD14-TLR2, but only A. actinomycetemcomitans and V. parvula stimulated HEK-CD14-TLR4. No differences were found in the activation of HEK-CD14-TLR2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated TLR2, which may be of importance for the Th1/Th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  - Propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in Turkey and from Brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of EEP on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible and MIC values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. Propolis from Kazan-Ankara showed most effective MIC values to the studied microorganisms. MBC values of Kazan-Ankara EEP samples were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. Because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.
TI  - Comparison of curet and paper point sampling of subgingival bacteria as analyzed  by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome of microbiological diagnostics may depend on the sampling technique. It was the aim of the present study to compare two widely used sampling techniques for subgingival bacteria using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. In group A, samples were taken first with a paper point and then with a curet at the same site (single-rooted teeth with probing depth >5 mm) before scaling and root planing and after 10 weeks. The sampling sequence was reversed in group B. The analysis enabled the quantification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythensis and total bacterial counts (TBCs). Statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Higher TBC was harvested with curets than by paper points (P = 0.008). The plaque composition with regard to total target pathogens was similar for both sampling techniques. A strong positive correlation was found between curet and paper point samples for TBC and single target bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was a relatively good agreement for the results of paper point and curet sampling. Thus, both techniques seem to be suitable for microbiological diagnostics.
TI  - Sonoporation is an efficient tool for intracellular fluorescent dextran delivery  and one-step double-crossover mutant construction in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Studies of microorganisms are often hindered by a lack of effective genetic tools. One such example is Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including those causing periodontal disease and preterm birth. The first double-crossover allelic-exchange mutant in F. nucleatum was recently constructed using sonoporation, a novel ultrasound-mediated intracellular delivery method, demonstrating potential for bacterial gene transfection. To better unveil its mechanism, the current study examines the factors affecting the outcome of sonoporation. Delivery of Texas Red-conjugated dextran into F. nucleatum by sonoporation was at least twice as efficient as that by electroporation, and sonoporation was nonbactericidal, unlike electroporation. The delivery efficiency was affected by the acoustic pressure amplitude, the duty cycle, and the quantity of microbubbles used to initiate cavitation but not by the pulse repetition frequency of ultrasound application. To examine the involvement of homologous recombination in sonoporation-mediated mutant construction, the highly conserved recA gene, which carried most of the consensus residues, including the P loop, was identified in F. nucleatum, and a double-crossover recA mutant of F. nucleatum 12230, US1610, was constructed by sonoporation. The mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to UV exposure compared with that of the wild type, indicating that the RecA function in F. nucleatum was conserved. Interestingly, US1610 was also sensitive to ultrasound treatment, suggesting the likely involvement of RecA in postsonoporation repair and survival. Since sonoporation has consistently generated one-step double-crossover mutants in F. nucleatum by use of intact suicide plasmids, this technology may be developed into an efficient tool for streamlining mutant construction in bacteria.
TI  - The in vivo dynamics of Streptococcus spp., Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Veillonella spp. in dental plaque biofilm as analysed by five-colour multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  - The formation and composition of dental plaque biofilm in vivo are important factors which influence the development of gingivitis, caries and periodontitis. Studying dental plaque biofilm in in vitro models can cause an oversimplification of the real conditions in the oral cavity. In this study, bovine enamel slabs were fixed in an individual acrylic appliance in situ to quantify dental plaque formation and composition using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Each of the five oligonucleotide probes used for FISH was specific for either eubacteria or one of four frequently isolated bacterial constituents belonging to early and late colonizers of tooth surfaces. The thickness of formed biofilm increased from 14.9+/-5.0 microm after 1 day to 49.3+/-11.6 microm after 7 days. Streptococcus spp. were predominant in 1-day-old dental plaque and decreased significantly after 7 days (P=0.0061). Compared to the first day, Fusobacterium nucleatum decreased after 2 days and increased significantly after 7 days (P=0.0006). The decreases of Actinomyces naeslundii content on day 2 and day 7 were significant (P=0.0028). Changes in Veillonella spp. were not significant during the study period (P >0.05). The results showed that an in vivo observation period of 7 days was required to detect significant changes in Streptococcus spp. and F. nucleatum. The multiplex FISH used is suitable for analysing the dynamics of four important bacterial constituents in the oral biofilm in epidemiological studies.
TI  - Case report: Lemierre syndrome presenting with fever and pharyngitis.
AB  
TI  - Evidence of periopathogenic microorganisms in placentas of women with preeclampsia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infectious disease that may act as a focus of infection. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder that often leads to maternal morbidity and mortality. Acute atherosis, the placental lesion of preeclampsia, shares many histopathological features with atherosclerosis. Recently, chronic infection was linked to the initiation of atherosclerosis. Oral pathogens have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, where they may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that periopathogenic bacteria may translocate into the placental tissues of women with preeclampsia. METHODS: Samples were taken from 16 placentas obtained from cesarean sections of women with preeclampsia and from 14 age-matched healthy pregnant women. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola. RESULTS: Eight of the 16 (50%) placenta specimens were positive for one or more periopathogenic bacteria in the preeclampsia group, compared to only two of the 14 samples (14.3%) from controls. Bacterial counts were statistically significantly higher in the preeclampsia group for all of the periopathogenic bacteria examined (P <or=0.0055). Although all of the target periopathogenic bacteria were found in the preeclampsia group, only three (P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and T. denticola) were found in the control group. CONCLUSION: The significant presence of periopathogenic microorganisms or their products in human placentas of women with preeclampsia may suggest a possible contribution of periopathogenic bacteria to the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
TI  - Signaling cascades triggered by bacterial metabolic end products during reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.
AB  - The present studies explore the role of polymicrobial infection in the reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and analyze signaling pathways activated upon this induction. We hypothesized that activation of the cellular stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathway would play a key role in the bacterium-mediated disruption of viral latency similar to that of previously reported results obtained with other inducers of gammaherpesvirus lytic replication. KSHV within infected BCBL-1 cells was induced to replicate following exposure to metabolic end products from gram-negative or -positive bacteria that were then simultaneously exposed to specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. We have determined that bacterium-mediated induction of lytic KSHV infection is significantly reduced by the inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway. In contrast, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not impair induction of lytic replication or p38 phosphorylation. Protein kinase C, though activated, was not the major pathway used for bacterium-induced viral reactivation. Furthermore, hyperacetylation of histones 3 and 4 was detected. Collectively, our results show that metabolic end products from these pathogens induce lytic replication of KSHV in BCBL-1 cells primarily via the activation of a stress-activated MAPK pathway. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time a mechanism by which polymicrobial bacterial infections result in KSHV reactivation and pathogenesis.
TI  - Differential activation of NF-kappaB and gene expression in oral epithelial cells by periodontal pathogens.
AB  - To investigate the molecular effects of the periodontopathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) on the oral epithelium, the H400 oral epithelial cell line was cultured in the presence of non-viable bacteria. Following confirmation of the presence of transcripts for the bacterial pattern recognition receptors in H400 cells, Toll-like receptors -2, -4 and -9, and components of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway, immunocytochemical analyses were performed showing that NF-kappaB was activated within 1 h of exposure to both periodontopathogens. A significantly greater number of NF-kappaB nuclear translocations were apparent following H400 cell exposure to FN as compared with PG. Gene expression analyses indicated that transcripts known to be regulated by the NF-kappaB pathway, including cytokines/chemokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2 and GM-CSF, were up-regulated following 4 and 24 h of exposure to both periodontopathogens. In addition, H400 periodontopathogen exposure resulted in differential regulation of transcripts for several cytokeratin gene family members. Consistent with the immunocytochemical data, microarray results indicated that FN induced a greater number of gene expression changes than PG following 24 h of exposure, 609 and 409 genes, respectively. Ninety-one genes were commonly differentially expressed by both periodontopathogens and represented biological processes commonly associated with periodontitis. Gene expression analyses by reserve transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of molecules identified from the microarray data sets, including Heme oxygenase-1, lysyl oxidase, SOD2, CCL20 and calprotectin components, confirmed their differential expression profiles induced by the two periodontopathogens. FN and PG have clearly different molecular effects on oral epithelial cells, potentially highlighting the importance of the composition of the plaque biofilm in periodontitis pathogenesis.
TI  - Rapid identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum by  fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  - Identification of clinically relevant Fusobacterium spp. is hampered by their slow growth, their frequent occurrence in polymicrobial culture, and the low reliability of biochemical differentiation methods. A newly developed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay allowed reliable and rapid identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum and Fusobacterium nucleatum from culture. Preliminary results show that the method offers the perspective for direct detection of these pathogens in blood cultures and abscess aspirates.
TI  - The detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. The purpose was to identify Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Ekinella corrodens (Ec), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Bacteroides forsythus (Bf), Treponema denticola (Td) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in Indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and DNA analysis done. The categorical data was analysed by Fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: In healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, Aa, Ec, Bf and Aa, Pg, Pi, Td, Fn were detected respectively. However, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only Pg( P =0.004), Cr( P =0.04), Fn( P =0.014) and Pg( P =0.002), Cr( P =0.02), Fn( P =0.008) were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the Japanese and Western periodontitis patients' population.
TI  - Response to alkaline stress by root canal bacteria in biofilms.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether bacteria isolated from infected root canals survive alkaline shifts better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. METHODOLOGY: Clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Olsenella uli, Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, S. oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm and planktonic cultures were stressed at pH 10.5 for 4 h, and cell viability determined using the fluorescent staining LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit. In addition, proteins released into extracellular culture fluids were identified by Western blotting. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis, L. paracasei, O. uli and S. gordonii survived in high numbers in both planktonic cultures and in biofilms after alkaline challenge. S. anginosus, S. oralis and F. nucleatum showed increased viability in biofilms compared with planktonic cultures. Alkaline exposure caused all planktonic cultures to aggregate into clusters and resulted in a greater extrusion of cellular proteins compared with cells in biofilms. Increased levels of DnaK, HPr and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were observed in culture fluids, especially amongst streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: In general, bacteria isolated from infected roots canals resisted alkaline stress better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures, however, planktonic cells appeared to use aggregation and the extracellular transport of specific proteins as survival mechanisms.
TI  - Efficacy of the de novo-derived antimicrobial peptide WLBU2 against oral bacteria.
AB  - The efficacy of a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide (WLBU2) was evaluated against three oral microorganisms (grown planktonically): Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. WLBU2 killed all three species, with F. nucleatum being the most susceptible. WLBU2 also reduced the bacterial burden of S. gordonii and F. nucleatum biofilms.
TI  - A comparison of implant-supported, bar- or ball-retained mandibular overdentures: a retrospective clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic study of 10 edentulous patients attending a recall visit.
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic comparisons of the peri-implant health in edentulous volunteers wearing long-standing implant-supported ball- or Dolder bar-retained mandibular overdentures were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten age- and gender-matched individuals (mean age, 71 years) with either ball- or bar-retained complete mandibular overdentures, scheduled for an annual implant recall examination, were investigated an average of 7 years after implant placement. Plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained from the peri-implant sulcus. The groups were compared with regard to peri-implant probing depth; plaque and bleeding on probing scores; sulcular fluid flow rates; implant stability measurements (Periotest device); relative concentrations of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola assessed by polymerase chain reaction analysis; and sulcular concentrations of interleukin-1beta and prostaglandin E2, assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found for any of the examined parameters between both study groups. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, both ball attachments and Dolder bars can be recommended for overdenture retention, with either one showing satisfying clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic findings in the peri-implant tissues after several years of service in healthy recall patients with good oral hygiene habits.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of fusobacterial brain abscess.
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed 122 patients with culture-proven bacterial brain abscesses (BBA) at our hospital over a period of 20 years and identified seven fusobacterial brain abscess patients. Here we describe the therapeutic experience in fusobacterial BBA cases and compare the clinical features of patients with single pathogen infection between fusobacterial and non-fusobacterial brain abscesses. Fusobacterium spp. accounted for 6% of the implicated pathogens of monomicrobial BBA. All seven fusobacterial brain abscess patients contracted the infection spontaneously, and two cases had important preceding events. F. nucleatum was the commonest one of the species described. Clinical presentations and laboratory data of these seven patients were similar to those of non-fusobacterial BBA, and in these patients the diagnosis was only confirmed by positive culture results. All seven patients were successfully treated with combined surgical and antimicrobial therapy. Although the average age tends to be older and there is a higher prevalence of multiloculated brain abscesses in patients with this type of BBA, the therapeutic outcome can be favorable with early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
TI  - Microbiological outcomes of quadrant versus full-mouth root planing as monitored  by real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (FMRP and QRP) as well as long-term effects. METHOD: Twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (FMRP) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant in four sessions at intervals of one week (QRP). Microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. The samples were evaluated by real-time PCR for quantification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (TBC). RESULTS: Treatment resulted in a TBC median log reduction of 0.75 (FMRP) and 0.72 (QRP). There were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). Likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.
TI  - Gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
AB  - Transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal Fusobacterium nucleatum. Overall, F. nucleatum and S. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (M. Handfield, J. J. Mans, G. Zheng, M. C. Lopez, S. Mao, A. Progulske-Fox, G. Narasimhan, H. V. Baker, and R. J. Lamont, Cell. Microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). The biological pathways significantly impacted by F. nucleatum and S. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Differential regulation of GADD45 and DUSP4, key components of the MAPK pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. Modulation of the MAPK pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, both the MAPK and Toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 demonstrated that F. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas S. gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. Stimulation of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of F. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of F. nucleatum than of S. gordonii.
TI  - Efficacy of gasiform ozone and photodynamic therapy on a multispecies oral biofilm in vitro.
AB  - Ozone gas and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been claimed to be antimicrobially  effective. This study assessed their antimicrobial potential in vitro. Mature six-species oral biofilms were treated as follows (n = 9 per group): (i) a 60-s application of gasiform vacuum-ozone or vacuum alone (on wet or air-dried biofilm samples); (ii) PDT (i.e. methylene blue in combination with or without a diode soft laser, and a soft laser alone); or (iii) antimicrobial solutions: immersion of biofilms for 60 s in 0.2 and 2% chlorhexidine or in 0.5 and 5% hypochlorite solution. Treatment with chlorhexidine or hypochlorite served as a positive control, whereas untreated samples served as negative controls. Colony-forming units on blood agar were counted. Only the 5% hypochlorite solution was able to totally eliminate the microorganisms in the biofilm. The observed reduction of viable counts by vacuum-ozone application and PDT was less than one log(10) step. Under the conditions of the current study, gasiform ozone and PDT had a minimal effect on the viability of microorganisms organized in a cariogenic biofilm.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide regulates matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase, and plasminogen activator production by human gingival fibroblasts: a potential role in connective tissue destruction.
AB  - Fibroblasts, a major constituent of gingival connective tissue, can produce immunoregulatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes that may contribute to tissue destruction. In this study, we evaluated the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), and plasminogen activators by gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced by periodontopathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS were characterized using antibody microarrays. We showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS induced the production of a 50 kDa plasminogen activator, MMP-2 and, to a lesser extent, MMP-3 by fibroblasts. The stimulation of fibroblasts with A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS also resulted in the overproduction of TIMP-1, but had no effect on the production of TIMP-2. Comparable responses were also obtained with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum LPS. The results of the microarray analyses showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS induced changes in the phosphorylation state and expression of gingival fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins. More specifically, they suggested that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS may induce both Jun N-terminus protein-serine kinases (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein-serine kinase p38 alpha (p38alpha MAPK) pathway activation, leading to increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) activities, which in turn can stimulate MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-1, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression. This may contribute to periodontal connective tissue destruction.
TI  - Interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. Porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize IL-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedius, Veillonella atypical and Prevotella nigrescens. IL-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. In addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from P. gingivalis and other bacteria. The role of P. gingivalis proteases was tested using Arg-X and Lys-X mutant strains. The role of LPS was investigated using purified P. gingivalis LPS and polymixin depletion. All species tested induced significant IL-1alpha production, but P. gingivalis was the weakest. Co-stimulation of monocytes with P. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce IL-1alpha production. This effect was at its greatest with C. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). Gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. However, 100 ng/ml of P. gingivalis LPS can reproduce the antagonistic activity of P. gingivalis culture supernatants. Periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate IL-1alpha production by monocytes. P. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its LPS appears to be the crucial component. This study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.
TI  - Antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most Gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some Clostridium difficile and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole MIC values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/mL. Ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive Gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though MIC values for piperacillin were often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. Carbapenems had MIC values < or =4 microg/L against all except some C. difficile and 2 strains of B. fragilis. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except C. difficile and a single Bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin MICs were found mainly among the B. fragilis and Prevotella groups, and a few C. difficile and F. nucleatum strains.
TI  - Sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  - AIM: To explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (UV) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. METHODOLOGY: The sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to UV light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm UV, at a fluence of 1-20 mJ cm(-2). An experimental model was designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of UV light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. RESULTS: Direct exposure to relatively low doses of UV light (2-7 mJ cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. Furthermore, an Enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to UV light (P < 0.001). UV was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. When 4 bacterial cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the UV light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. CONCLUSIONS: The application of UV light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. Nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the UV light dose adapted accordingly.
TI  - Inflammation associated with implants with different surface types.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with different transmucosal implant surfaces in dogs. METHODS: Three experimental and one control single-stage implants were randomly placed on each side of the jaw in eight dogs. The transmucosal portion of the test implants consisted of an acid-etched surface (type A), a machined surface with a circumferential groove (type C) and a surface prepared by mild anodic oxidation (type D). The control was a standard machined surface (type B). In order to determine the response to the different surfaces, plaque control was carried out twice weekly following placement of the implants for the entire period of the experiment. At 6 months, gingival biopsies and plaque samples were obtained. The area of inflammatory infiltrate and the nature of the infiltrating cell types were determined using immunohistology. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify putative periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Inflammatory infiltrates were associated with all implant surfaces and were commonly found subepithelially and perivascularly. T cells were the predominant infiltrating cell type in all lesions, associated with the different surfaces. In all lesions the CD4 : CD8 ratio was approximately 2 : 1. Statistical analysis showed that the type C surface (machined surface with a groove) had significantly larger inflammatory infiltrates than the type B surface (machined surface without a groove; P<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found with respect to the size of the inflammatory infiltrates or in terms of the nature of infiltrating cells. However, despite the intensive plaque control regime, plaque was present on all implant surfaces at the time of biopsy 6 months after placement. All implants had similar numbers of Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was not detected in any sample. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the development of inflammation associated with implants is independent of surface type, but is nevertheless associated with the presence of plaque. The different surfaces had no influence on the nature of the infiltrate, with T cells being the predominant cell type in all lesions. Finally, the different implant surface types seemed not to influence the peri-implant microbiota. However, the presence of the circumferential groove tended to be associated with larger infiltrates. Whether this is due to increased plaque accumulation remains to be determined.
TI  - Hyperactivity and reactivity of peripheral blood neutrophils in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Some evidence exists that peripheral neutrophils from patients with chronic periodontitis generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after Fcgamma-receptor stimulation than those from healthy controls. We hypothesized that peripheral neutrophils in periodontitis also show both hyper-reactivity to plaque organisms and hyperactivity in terms of baseline, unstimulated generation and release of ROS. Peripheral neutrophils from chronic periodontitis patients and age/sex/smoking-matched healthy controls (18 pairs) were assayed for total ROS generation and extracellular ROS release, with and without stimulation (Fcgamma-receptor and Fusobacterium nucleatum), using luminol and isoluminol chemiluminescence. Assays were performed with and without priming with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Phox gene expression (p22, p47, p67, gp91) was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Neutrophils from patients produced higher mean levels of ROS in all assays. Total generation and extracellular release of ROS by patients' cells were significantly greater than those from controls after FcgammaR-stimulation, with (P = 0.023) and without (P < or = 0.023) priming with GM-CSF. Differences in unstimulated total ROS generation were not significant. By contrast, patients' cells demonstrated greater baseline, extracellular ROS release than those from controls (P = 0.004). This difference was maintained after priming with LPS (P = 0.028) but not GM-CSF (P = 0.217). Phox gene expression was similar in patient and control cells at baseline and stimulation with F. nucleatum (3 h) consistently reduced gp91(PHOX) transcripts. Our data demonstrate that peripheral neutrophils from periodontitis patients exhibit hyper-reactivity following stimulation (Fcgamma-receptor and F. nucleatum) and hyperactivity in terms of excess ROS release in the absence of exogenous stimulation. This hyperactive/-reactive neutrophil phenotype is not associated with elevated phox gene expression.
TI  - Rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  - One of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. In this study we hypothesized that P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. Groups of rats were infected with either P. gingivalis, T. denticola, or T. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without Fusobacterium nucleatum. PCR analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host with the infecting bacteria. PCR analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia as a consortium. Furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of IgG antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. Radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without F. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. These results documented that P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive Brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and HIV-seronegative Brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and HIV-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 172 subjects were distributed into two HIV-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [H+CP+] and 35 periodontally healthy [H+CP-] individuals) and two HIV-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [H-CP+] and 51 periodontally healthy [H-CP-] subjects). Subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. All HIV-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 2 years. The presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by DNA probes and the checkerboard method. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. RESULTS: H-CP+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than H+CP+ patients, whereas H+CP- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than H-CP- subjects (P <0.01). Patients who were HIV seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than HIV seropositive patients. Periodontal pathogens including Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in H-CP+ subjects compared to H+CP+ and controls. In contrast, Enterococcus faecalis and Acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected subjects (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of HIV-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in HIV-seropositive subjects under HAART.
TI  - The proteomic profile of Fusobacterium nucleatum is regulated by growth pH.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a saccharolytic Gram-negative anaerobic organism believed to play an important role in the microbial succession associated with the development of periodontal disease. Its genome contains niche-specific genes shared with the other inhabitants of dental plaque, which may help to explain its ability to survive and grow in the changing environmental conditions experienced in the gingival sulcus during the transition from health to disease. The pH of the gingival sulcus increases during the development of periodontitis and this is thought to occur by the metabolism of nutrients supplied by gingival crevicular fluid. In comparison with other plaque inhabitants, F. nucleatum has the greatest ability to neutralize acidic environments. The differential expression of soluble cytoplasmic proteins induced by acidic (pH 6.4) or basic (pH 7.4 and 7.8) conditions, during long-term anaerobic growth in a chemostat, was identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis software. Twenty-two proteins, found to have altered expression in response to external pH, were identified by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. Eight differentially expressed proteins associated with increased energy (ATP) production via the 2-oxoglutarate and Embden-Meyerhof pathways appeared to be directed towards either cellular biosynthesis or the maintenance of internal homeostasis. Overall, these results represent the first proteomic investigation of F. nucleatum and the identification of gene products which may be important in the organism's persistence during the transition from health to disease in vivo.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. Nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the Ribosomal Database Project II database. Phylotypes from 37 genera representing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were identified. Results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. Since members of the domain Archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16S archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. A Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. DNA from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. Trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. Conversely, Porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. All other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. These results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray data of the FadA adhesin from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe prevalent in the oral cavity  that is associated with periodontal disease, preterm birth and infections in other parts of the human body. The bacteria attach to and invade epithelial and endothelial cells in the gum tissue and elsewhere via a 13.7 kDa adhesin protein FadA (Fusobacterium adhesin A). FadA exists in two forms: the intact form (pre-FadA), consisting of 129 amino acids, and the mature form (mFadA), which lacks an 18-residue signal sequence. Both forms have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. mFadA has been crystallized. The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6(1) or P6(5), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 59.3, c = 125.7 A and one molecule per asymmetric unit. The crystals exhibit an unusually high solvent content of 74%. Synchrotron X-ray data have been collected to 1.9 A. The crystals are suitable for X-ray structure determination. The crystal structure of FadA may provide a basis for the development of therapeutic agents to combat periodontal disease and other infections associated with F. nucleatum.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. Nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. Nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. The biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. METHODS: Six common oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Capnocytophaga gingivalis ATCC 33624, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. Sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/L. All of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. The optical densities (OD) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. RESULTS: Nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/L had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low pH values. The antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low pH values. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. Nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: Nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on these organisms.
TI  - Common antacids could help keep gingivitis at bay.
AB  
TI  - Effects of sonicated Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Lactobacillus casei extracts on interleukin-8 production by human dental pulp cells.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Lactobacillus casei on the production of IL-8 by human dental pulp cells. Human dental pulp cells from teeth of young patients (aged 18-25 years) were cultured and tested with sonicated P. intermedia ATCC 25611, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and L. casei ATCC 4646 extracts. IL-8 secreted into the culture supernatants were measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Cell viability was evaluated using trypan blue exclusion technique. IL-8 production by human dental pulp cells increased significantly at 12 and 24 hours after exposure to P. intermedia and F. nucleatum, whereas L. casei extract exhibited low IL-8 production. The sonicated bacterial extracts did not significantly affect viability or total number of dental pulp cells.
TI  - Amphipathic polymers: tools to fold integral membrane proteins to their active form.
AB  - Among the major obstacles to pharmacological and structural studies of integral membrane proteins (MPs) are their natural scarcity and the difficulty in overproducing them in their native form. MPs can be overexpressed in the non-native state as inclusion bodies, but inducing them to achieve their functional three-dimensional structure has proven to be a major challenge. We describe here the use of an amphipathic polymer, amphipol A8-35, as a novel environment that allows both beta-barrel and alpha-helical MPs to fold to their native state, in the absence of detergents or lipids. Amphipols, which are extremely mild surfactants, appear to favor the formation of native intramolecular protein-protein interactions over intermolecular or protein-surfactant ones. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated using as models OmpA and FomA, two outer membrane proteins from the eubacteria Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium nucleatum, respectively, and bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump from the plasma membrane of the archaebacterium Halobacterium salinarium.
TI  - [Lemierre's syndrome: literature review].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to recall the pathogenesis, clinic aspects and therapeutic options for Lemierre's syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study (1998-2005) of 4 patients, 3 males and 1 female, average age 22 years (18-30). Bacteriological samples, a chest radiograph and a cervical and thoracic CT-scan with injection were available for all patients who were given broad spectrum antibiotic therapy for 3 to 6 weeks. Surgical treatment was necessary for 3 patients. A review of the literature from Medline was performed. RESULTS: Three patients had a peritonsillar abscess. All of them exhibited thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein or one of its tributary branches. In all patients, metastatic infections were noted. In one, arthritis and mediastinitis were associated. The causal microorganism was Fusobacterium (necrophorum--2, nucleatum--1) in three patients. In one, bacteriological samples were negative. Transfer to an intensive care unit was necessary for one patient. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Lemierre's syndrome is a rare but acute medical condition which concerns young immunocompetent people. The pathogenesis consists of the development of infectious thrombophlebitis in the internal jugular vein or one of its tributary branches caused by a focal sepsis, localized in most the cases in the oropharynx, leading to metastatic infections, generally to the lung. Treatment is medical but surgery is sometimes required.
TI  - Carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for the detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola. METHODS: Seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. The data obtained were compared for the two methods. RESULTS: The results obtained with real-time PCR were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. The detection differences were 3% for A. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for P. intermedia, and 12.5% for F. nucleatum. However, the differences for P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. No comparison was possible for T. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. The variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens) of the PCR probe. Unlike bacterial culture, PCR allows the detection of T. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. For F. nucleatum, T. forsythia and P. gingivalis, the real-time PCR technique was more sensitive than culture. CONCLUSION: Good results were obtained with the real-time PCR technique for the six periopathogens targeted. This method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. The periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological activity with an antibiogram.
TI  - [Multiple intracerebral lesions. Identification of the causative agent by 16S rDNA-PCR].
AB  - Molecular biological methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enable microbiologists to detect bacteria even if antibiotic treatment has already been started. Based on this case report of a 39-year-old man with multiple intracerebral lesions, we describe a PCR method called 16S rDNA-PCR which can be used to identify panbacterial DNA by focussing on the universal gene sequences for the bacterial 16S part of the ribosome.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. METHODS: Single-species biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on agar medium. The biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. Sterile saline was used as control. After each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 mL of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). The micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. Aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. Colony-forming units were calculated. The samples were compared using the Friedman and Tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for S. aureus with 2.5% NaOCl. Antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. Saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (P < 0.05) from NaOCl and chlorhexidine. P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. Strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for 5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 J/cm2. Methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of E. faecalis (53% killing). The same concentration of methylene blue in combination with red light (222 J/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of E. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. We conclude that PDT may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Periodontal therapy in siblings with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome and tinea capitis: a report of two cases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Report of clinical and microbiological periodontal findings before and 6 months after treatment of two siblings with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and tinea capitis. METHODS: Two brothers, RG 3 years and NG 5 years of age, were referred for treatment due to premature mobility of their deciduous teeth. Probing depths (PPD), attachment levels (PAL-V), and furcation involvements were examined clinically. Panoramic radiographs were taken. Subgingival plaque samples within the deepest pocket of each tooth were taken and analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (AA), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. One-stage full-mouth scaling and extraction of hopeless teeth were performed under general anaesthesia, followed by systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole for 7 days. Clinical and microbiological analyses were performed 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: Before treatment, both siblings had exhibited PPD of up to 13 mm, Class III furcation defects at four teeth, and marginal suppuration. AA was detected in both patients and at all teeth at levels ranging from 3.0 x 10(2) to 5.1 x 10(6). Both patients exhibited palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis. Seven teeth were extracted from RG, and nine from NG. Six months after treatment, PPD had been reduced to <or=5 mm. AA was not detected in any of the remaining teeth. CONCLUSION: Even periodontally affected deciduous teeth of PLS patients can be treated successfully. Suppression of AA to below detection level seems to be of high significance.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. Tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel using platinum cell technology. The electrolyzed tap water (called Puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. In addition, Puri-water was used as a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. Puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. It also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar. Our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.
TI  - Oral adhesion and survival of probiotic and other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most probiotic products are consumed orally and hence it is feasible that the bacteria in these products may also attach to oral surfaces; however, the effects of these bacteria on the oral ecosystem are mostly unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the oral colonization potential of different probiotic, dairy, and fecal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in vitro. METHODS: The binding of 17 Lactobacillus and seven Bifidobacterium strains to hydroxyapatite and microtitre wells coated with human saliva was tested. Binding of selected strains to human buccal epithelial cells and co-adherence with Fusobacterium nucleatum were also investigated. In addition, the survival in sterilized human whole saliva was examined. RESULTS: There was a large variation in binding to saliva-coated surfaces and buccal epithelial cells but all strains survived in saliva. The binding pattern of the probiotics did not differ from the binding of the fecal strains. F. nucleatum altered the binding of both the low-binding bifidobacteria and the high-binding lactobacilli. CONCLUSION: The differences in binding in vitro may indicate that there are also differences in the persistence of the different probiotic strains in the oral cavity in vivo.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
TI  - Influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. In eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated. After 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. Of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. When bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. Combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. When no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the quality of the root filling. In contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. In root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. The present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.
TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against clinical isolates of Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although most susceptibility studies for linezolid have investigated  aerobic bacteria, only a few have investigated anaerobe isolates. The aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial activity of linezolid against a larger sample of clinical isolates of Fusobacterium spp. and to report on the detailed susceptibility, stratified by species. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility of 80 clinical isolates of Fusobacterium (Fusobacterium necrophorum, n = 34; Fusobacterium nucleatum, n = 20; Fusobacterium varium, n = 18; Fusobacterium mortiferum; n = 8) was tested and compared with the activity of the older compounds amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. RESULTS: The MIC of linezolid ranged from 0.016 to 1.0 mg/L, with the MIC(90) being 0.5 mg/L. The highest MIC obtained for linezolid (1.0 mg/L) was measured for an F. varium isolate. The MIC(90) for both, amoxicillin (range: 0.016-0.75 mg/L) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range: 0.047-0.75 mg/L), was 0.5 mg/L. Overall, no resistant strains were found in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid was less active against F. necrophorum (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L) and F. nucleatum (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L), equally active against F. varium (MIC(90) 0.75 mg/L) and slightly more active against F. mortiferum (MIC(90) 0.19 mg/L).
TI  - Characterisation and subcellular localisation of the GroEL-like and DnaK-like proteins isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with periodontitis in humans, and is a central member of the dental biofilm. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) of many different bacteria have been considered to play important roles during inflammations and infections. We have identified and characterised the HSP60 and HSP70, the Escherichia coli GroEL and DnaK homologues, respectively, in F. nucleatum ATCC 10953. The N-terminal 22 amino acid residues of HSP60 exhibited up to 63.6% identity with members of the HSP60 heat shock protein family of some selected bacterial species, while the N-terminal of 25 residues of HSP70 revealed up to 80% identity with members of the HSP70 family. The subcellular localisation of HSP60 and HSP70 was analysed by immunoblotting of bacterial cell fractions and immunoelectron microscopy of whole cells. HSP60 and HSP70 were localised in the cytosol, associated with membranes and extracellular fractions. These results are consistent with localisation for HSPs found in other micro-organisms, which further lead to the suggestion of a potential role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  - The bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. Although recent studies have used DNA probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. The purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. The most frequently isolated species included Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium group, Actinomyces spp., Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella spp. and Selenomonas spp. Reported for the first time are Actinomyces turicensis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium saburreum, E. timidum, Prevotella tannerae, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter mucosalis, Leptotrichia buccalis, Selenomonas flueggei, and Centipeda periodontii. Species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.
TI  - Susceptibility of Fusobacterium nucleatum to killing by peroxidase-iodide-hydrogen peroxide combination in buffer solution and in human whole saliva.
AB  - Some Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria have been associated with the infection of  tooth supporting tissues, i.e. periodontitis. Of these bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum is sensitive to lactoperoxidase/myeloperoxidase-iodide-hydrogen peroxide system in vitro, but salivary concentrations of thiocyanate abolishes the bactericidality. These bacteria are located in periodontal pockets, on oral mucosa and in saliva. Although F. nucleatum most probably does not belong to the group of main periodontal pathogens, it sustains its proportion in the periodontal flora when gingivitis progresses to periodontitis. In this study, the sensitivity of F. nucleatum to different horseradish peroxidase-iodide-hydrogen peroxide combinations was tested both in buffer and in sterilized human whole saliva. Horseradish peroxidase was chosen because it does not bind thiocyanate at pH > or = 6. After 1h incubation at 37 degrees C, the cell viability was estimated by plate count and with flow cytometer using LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit (Molecular Probes, USA). In saliva, the horseradish peroxidase (50 microg/mL)-iodide (2.5 mM)-hydrogen peroxide (2.5 mM) combination decreased the amount of viable bacteria to 37% compared to 85% in the control without any of the components when measured with flow cytometer. Replacement of buffer by saliva decreased the bactericidality of the peroxidase system. However, in buffer less iodide and hydrogen peroxide was needed to produce significant decrease in the number of viable bacteria when measured by plate count than with flow cytometer. Our study shows that horseradish peroxidase-iodide-hydrogen peroxide combination is able to kill F. nucleatum cells in saliva. Horseradish peroxidase-iodide-hydrogen peroxide combination may be useful to diminish the degree of re-colonization of periodontitis-associated bacteria after periodontal therapy and to inhibit the transmission of these bacteria via saliva.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - The behaviour of Fusobacterium nucleatum chemostat-grown in glucose- and amino acid-based chemically defined media.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe, found in a number of different areas of human and animal bodies as part of the resident microbiota. However, it also appears to be involved in polymicrobial infections in such sites. It occurs in the oral cavity where it is a prominent member of various bacterial consortia associated with periodontal diseases. Like most fusobacteria, it derives energy via the fermentation of amino acids which it can obtain through the dissimilation of small peptides. However, the role of simple carbohydrates, such as glucose, in its growth and metabolism are not well understood. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to study the behaviour ofF. nucleatum grown anaerobically in continuous culture in two different chemically-defined media (CDM); one containing only amino acids as the energy source, the other containing glucose as the predominant energy provider. At various dilution rates the culture were assayed for dry weight, intracellular polyglucose (IP) content, residual amino acids and glucose and acidic metabolic end-products. In the carbohydrate-free CDM the acidic end-products were a constant acetate : butyrate : formate of 1.5 : 1 : 0.4. The values of Y(max)amino acids, maximum yield of bacteria per mol of amino acids consumed, for two strains were estimated to be 15.2 and 18.6 g dry wt/mol, respectively. Them(amino acids), maintenance energy requirement for growth on amino acids, for the two strains was 0.81 and 0.94 mmol/g dry wt/h, respectively. Growth of one strain in the glucose-based CDM gave an estimated Y(max)glucose of 67.2 and an m(glucose) of 0.38; the acidic end-products were a fairly constant acetate : butyrate : formate : lactate of 0.7 : 1 : 0.3 : 2.5. Only at low growth rates, and then only in small amount, was IP produced in this medium. Overall, it was concluded that the occurrence of F. nucleatum in widely-differing oral niches may be explained, at least in part, by its metabolic versatility.
TI  - Protective effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins against oxidative stress induced by lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During phagocytosis or stimulation with bacterial components, macrophages activate various cell processes, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which are critical for successful defense against invading organisms. Increased levels of ROS/RNS create oxidative stress that results in tissue and bone destruction. Grape seed proanthocyanidins have been reported to possess a wide range of biologic properties against oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSE) and commercial polyphenols on the production of ROS and RNS and on the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of periodontopathogens. METHODS: Macrophages (RAW 264.7) were treated with non-toxic concentrations of either GSE or commercial polyphenols (gallic acid [GA] and [-]-epigallocatechin-3-gallate [EGCG]) and stimulated with LPS of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Fusobacterium nucleatum, and iNOS expression was evaluated by immunoblotting. Nitric oxide (NO) production was quantified using the colorimetric Griess assay, whereas ROS production was measured with the fluorescent 123-dihydrorhodamine dye. RESULTS: GSE strongly decreased NO and ROS production and iNOS expression by LPS-stimulated macrophages. GA also revealed a strong inhibitory effect on NO production without affecting iNOS expression but slightly increasing ROS production. EGCG showed an inhibitory effect on NO and ROS production and on iNOS expression by macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that proanthocyanidins have potent antioxidant properties and should be considered a potential agent in the prevention of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of FUS-1 (OXA-85), a narrow-spectrum class D beta-lactamase from Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
AB  - Previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in Fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. An F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. DNA cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class D beta-lactamase named FUS-1 (OXA-85). A recombinant Escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(FUS-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate decrease in the MICs with clavulanic acid. The bla(FUS-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. It was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class D beta-lactamase gene. The FUS-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with OXA-63 from Brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of Campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). FUS-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class D beta-lactamases. Kinetic analysis revealed that FUS-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. FUS-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and NaCl. FUS-1 is the first example of a class D beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - Inflammation, heat shock proteins and periodontal pathogens in atherosclerosis: an immunohistologic study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. Bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial GroEL with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. METHODS: In this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and GroEL were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. RESULTS: The inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by CD14(+) macrophages and CD4(+) T cells. Most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were HLA-DR(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of CD25 expression, demonstrating that the activated T cells were not proliferating. Few CD1a(+) and CD83(+) cells were noted. Human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. GroEL and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. Chlamydia pneumoniae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results give evidence for a specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. Whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Effectiveness of ultrasonic instruments in the therapy of severe periodontitis: a comparative clinical-microbiological assessment with curettes.
AB  - Patients with deep periodontal pockets were treated with either Vector System (TG) or manual instruments (CG). Clinical assessments by supragingival plaque (PL+), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and subgingival plaque collection for microbiological analysis were made prior to and after treatment. Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. GI, PD, CAL and the number of BOP+ sites underwent a significant reduction over time in both groups. When compared to baseline, the pair-wise analyses showed significantly lower PD and CAL at 6 months in the CG and significant reductions in the GI, PD, CAL and a number of BOP+ sites at 3 and 6 months in the TG. For microbiological results, significant reductions were seen for C. rectus and R. gingivalis in the CG and for T. forsythensis, E. corrodens and T. denticola in the TG. The total bacterial count underwent a reduction in both groups. Both ultrasonic and manual debridement are equally effective in non-surgical periodontal therapy of severe periodontitis in terms of clinical and microbiological effects.
TI  - Evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Despite limitations of swab transport systems (STS), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. We evaluated the performance of 4 commercial STS: M40 Transystem (S1, Copan Italia, Bovezzo, Italy), UNI-TER (S2, MEUS, Piove di Sacco, Italy), Euromed (S3, LAB SERVICE, Surbo, Italy), and Eurotubo (S4, Deltalab, Rubi, Spain). Survival of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (NCCLS M40-A) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. After 24 h, only S1 was able to maintain Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305), Haemophilus influenzae (10211), and Neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all STS except S1 (46% recovery). Eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with S1. Resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the STS.
TI  - Antimicrobial barrier of an in vitro oral epithelial model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelia function as a microbial barrier and are actively involved in recognizing and responding to bacteria. Our goal was to examine a tissue engineered model of buccal epithelium for its response to oral bacteria and proinflammatory cytokines and compare the tissue responses with those of a submerged monolayer cell culture. DESIGN: The tissue model was characterized for keratin and beta-defensin expression. Altered expression of beta-defensins was evaluated by RT-PCR after exposure of the apical surface to oral bacteria and after exposure to TNF-alpha in the medium. These were compared to the response in traditional submerged oral epithelial cell culture. RESULTS: The buccal model showed expression of differentiation specific keratin 13, hBD1 and hBD3 in the upper half of the tissue; hBD2 was not detected. hBD1 mRNA was constitutively expressed, while hBD2 mRNA increased 2-fold after exposure of the apical surface to three oral bacteria tested and hBD3 mRNA increased in response to the non-pathogenic bacteria tested. In contrast, hBD2 mRNA increased 3-600-fold in response to bacteria in submerged cell culture. HBD2 mRNA increased over 100-fold in response to TNF-alpha in the tissue model and 50-fold in submerged cell culture. Thus, the tissue model is capable of upregulating hBD2, however, the minimal response to bacteria suggests that the tissue has an effective antimicrobial barrier due to its morphology, differentiation, and defensin expression. CONCLUSIONS: The oral mucosal model is differentiated, expresses hBD1 and hBD3, and has an intact surface with a functional antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - Antimicrobial actions of benzimidazoles against the oral anaerobes Fusobacterium  nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Benzimidazoles are widely used as proton-pump inhibitors to control stomach hyperacidity and have been found also to have antimicrobial actions against Helicobacter pylori and oral streptococci. Our primary aim was to determine if they are active also against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis. Our major focus was on catabolism because it leads to production of inflammatory metabolites such as butyrate and ammonia. The benzimidazoles are effective in the protonated form at acid pH values and cause irreversible inhibition of enzymes associated with formation of drug-target disulfide bonds. METHODS: Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586 and Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 were grown anaerobically in suspension cultures, harvested, washed and exposed to the benzimidazole lansoprazole at pH values of 4 or 5 before being washed and used for standard assays to detect inhibition of catabolic functions, uptake of the agent and lethality. RESULTS: Lansoprazole was found to be a bacteriostatic, multi-target antimicrobial against F. nucleatum under anaerobic conditions inhibitory for amino acid fermentation and also for glycolysis of glucose or fructose. ID(50) values for fermentation of amino acids and dipeptides by F. nucleatum ranged from 0.05 mM for lysine to 0.25 mM for serine. Fructose catabolism was highly sensitive with an ID(50) value of 0.03 mM apparently related to high sensitivity of the phosphoenolpyruvate:fructose phosphotransferase system, while the ID(50) for glucose catabolism by intact cells was some 0.07 mM. Fermentation of aspartate or aspartylaspartate by P. intermedia was found to be lansoprazole-sensitive with ID(50) values of about 0.18 and 0.20 mM, respectively. CONCLUSION: Catabolism of amino acids, dipeptides and sugars by oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis are sensitive to the inhibitory actions of lansoprazole. Thus, catabolic pathways are potential targets for use of benzimidazoles against bacteria involved in gingivitis.
TI  - State-dependent conformations of the translocation pathway in the tyrosine transporter Tyt1, a novel neurotransmitter:sodium symporter from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The gene of a novel prokaryotic member (Tyt1) of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family has been cloned from Fusobacterium nucleatum. In contrast to eukaryotic and some prokaryotic NSSs, which contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), Tyt1 contains only 11 TMs, a characteristic shared by approximately 70% of prokaryotic NSS homologues. Nonetheless upon heterologous expression in an engineered Escherichia coli host, Tyt1 catalyzes robust Na+-dependent, highly selective l-tyrosine transport. Genetic engineering of Tyt1 variants devoid of cysteines or with individually retained endogenous cysteines at positions 18 or 238, at the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM6, respectively, preserved normal transport activity. Whereas cysteine-less Tyt1 was resistant to the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents, N-ethylmaleimide inhibited transport by Tyt1 variants containing either one or both of the endogenous cysteines, and this inhibition was altered by the substrates sodium and tyrosine, consistent with substrate-induced dynamics in the transport pathway. Our findings support a binding model of Tyt1 function in which an ordered sequence of substrate-induced structural changes reflects distinct conformational states of the transporter. This work identifies Tyt1 as the first functional bacterial NSS member putatively consisting of only 11 TMs and shows that Tyt1 is a suitable model for the study of NSS dynamics with relevance to structure/function relationships of human NSSs, including the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters.
TI  - Characterization of proteolytic activities of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - This investigation attempted to detect the proteolytic activity of Fusobacterium  nucleatum in living cells, lysate cells, and supernatant of cultures. The reactions were optimized in their pH, temperature, reaction time, enzyme source, and substrate volume. Synthetic substrates beta-naphthylamides (Cys-Na, Ser-Na, Leu-Na, Glu-Na, Lys-Na and BANA), carbobenzoxy L-tirosine p-nitrophenylester (CTN), and natural substrate azoalbumin were used. Reaction occurred with Cys-Na, Ser-Na, and Glu-Na in living cells and with Glu-Na, Leu-Na, and CTN substrates in lysate cells. The supernatant reacted only with Glu-Na. Optimal pH ranged from 6.0 to 7.5, except for CTN (pH 13), and optimal temperature, between 30 and 40 degrees C. Optimal reaction time was 60 min, except for Glu-Na in living cells (40 min), lysate cells (20 min), and CTN substrate (80 min). There was no activity with Lys-Na, BANA, and azoalbumin. Proteolytic activity was assessed by several inhibitors and the presence of metallo, serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteases were detected.
TI  - The association of anaerobic bacteria with infectious mononucleosis.
AB  - This review summarizes the information that supports the potential importance of  anaerobic bacteria in the pharyngo-tonsillitis (PT) associated with infectious mononucleosis (IM). Evidence supportive of the potential of involvement of bacteria in IM was provided by several studies that showed increased recovery of bacteria on the tonsillar surfaces in IM. Several studies demonstrated that metronidazole therapy alleviated the clinical symptoms of tonsillar hypertrophy and shortened the duration of fever in IM. Metronidazole has no antimicrobial activity against aerobic bacteria and is only effective against anaerobic bacteria. A possible mechanism of its action is the suppression of the oral anaerobic flora that might contribute to the inflammatory process induced by the Epstein-Barr virus. This explanation is supported by the increased recovery of Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum from the tonsillar surfaces during the acute phases of IM and an immune response against these organisms by patients with IM. Although more studies are needed, these findings support the possible pathogenicity of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in the PT associated with IM.
TI  - Anaerobes in the upper respiratory tract in infancy.
AB  - Development of the indigenous microbiota begins on the surfaces of the human body after birth when infants are exposed to continuous person-to-person and environmental contacts with microbes. Anaerobes constitute a significant part of indigenous bacterial communities at different body sites. Pioneering anaerobic commensals are able to colonize and survive in the oral cavity during the first months of life. After teeth emerge, more attachment sites and potential niches are available for anaerobic bacterial colonization. Specific partner relationships influence the composition and stability of forming multigeneric communities, biofilms, where Fusobacterium nucleatum is of specific interest. In infancy, the oral colonization seems to be rather stable at species level, though not at clonal level. The colonization pattern in the nasopharynx is different from that in the oral cavity; anaerobes are absent from healthy nasopharynges but transiently colonize this anatomical site during infection. The most plausible origin for nasopharyngeal anaerobes is the oral cavity and, conceivably, saliva is the most likely transmission vehicle. Whether anaerobic bacteria colonize the nasopharynx just because of ecological changes favoring their growth or whether they could play an active role in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections is not known.
TI  - The leukotoxin operon of Fusobacterium necrophorum is not present in other species of Fusobacterium.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the leukotoxin operon of Fusobacterium necrophorum has been determined. The operon consists of three genes (lktBAC) of which the leukotoxin structural gene is the middle determinant. Southern and western blot analyses and flow cytometry analysis for biological activity of the culture supernatants were carried out to determine if the leukotoxin is present in other species of the genus Fusobacterium. Only the two subspecies of F. necrophorum were found to possess the leukotoxin locus and produce the toxin. The human periodontal pathogen, F. nucleatum does not produce detectable leukotoxin. The F. necrophorum leukotoxin was found to be active against human neutrophils.
TI  - Anaerobic microbiology in 198 cases of pleural empyema: a Bulgarian study.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in 198 patients with pleural empyema and the susceptibility of isolates to eight antibacterial agents. Isolates were identified by the Crystal anaerobes identification system, API System rapid ID 32 A and/or routine methods. Susceptibility was tested by Sceptor MIC system for anaerobic bacteria and limited agar dilution method. Anaerobic bacteria were found in 74.2% of the patients and included 247 strains within 21 genera. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (52 isolates), Fusobacterium (51), microaerophilic streptococci (24), Prevotella (19) and Bacteroides species (11). Common species/groups were Fusobacterium nucleatum (in 27.2% of specimens yielding anaerobes), Micromonas micros (8.2%), Finegoldia magna (7.5%), Bacteroides fragilis group (6.8%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6.1%) and F. necrophorum (5.4%). No resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected. The susceptibility rates of Gram-negative anaerobic isolates to penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were 63.8%, 90.2%, 87.8%, 58.6%, 98.8% and 71%, and those of Gram-positive anaerobes were 79.2%, 100%, 84.3%, 68.4%, 41.9% and 75%, respectively. The wide diversity of isolated anaerobic genera and species and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates emphasize the role of the anaerobic microbiology in cases of pleural empyema.
TI  - Genetic diversity of oral Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from patients with different clinical conditions.
AB  - The genetic diversity of 23 oral Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from 15 periodontal patients, eight from seven healthy subjects, nine from nine AIDS patients and two from two Cebus apella monkeys were analyzed. EcoRI restricted the bacterial DNA and 28 ribotypes grouped from A to J groups were obtained. Isolates formed 24 ribotypes which were contained into A, B, C, D, E and F groups, and three reference strains and two clinical isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and E. coli CDC formed four different ribotypes into the G, H, I and J groups. Moreover, from nine F. nucleatum from AIDS patients, six were ribotyped as group C and three as group D. By using ribotyping we distinguished F. nucleatum recovered from different sources. It is possible that isolates from AIDS patients may contain some phenotypic or genotypic factor did not observed in this study.
TI  - Selective inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor Xa inhibitor, DX-9065a.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. However, there is no drug specific for P. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor X, DX-9065a, on growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. METHODS: We incubated P. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of DX-9065a and examined the effect of DX-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. We also examined the effects of DX9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains RgpA and RgpB), from P. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. RESULTS: DX-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and its effect on P. gingivalis was bactericidal. Trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected in P. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by DX-9065a. DX-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of RgpA and RgpB from P. gingivalis. Furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by DX-9065a. CONCLUSIONS: DX-9065a inhibits P. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in P. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongue dorsum of elderly people.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. In addition, the relationship between the number of teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of 85-year-old people was assessed. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. Five periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (Streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. RESULTS: Periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. Between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for P. gingivalis (p<0.0001), T. denticola (p<0.001), F. nucleatum (p=0.002), and T. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for A. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or S. mutans (p=0.147). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. It was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. There was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that tongue care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect in vitro of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide impregnated  gutta-percha points.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of points containing antiseptics used for temporary obturation in endodontics. Points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko and Hygienic), and chlorhexidine (Roeko) were tested and gutta-percha points served as control (Meta Dental Corp.). The following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Staphylococcus aureus (Sta), Candida albicans (Ca), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) ATCC 25586, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) ATCC 33277, and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) ATCC 25611. The experiments were organized in three stages: 1st stage: one point of each kind was placed on agar plates previously seeded with microorganisms. 2nd stage: Another group of points was immersed in broth for 24 hours and placed on the seeded agar. Samples were then incubated at 37 degrees in the conditions of oxygen and for the time required by each microorganism. The zones of bacterial inhibition around each point were measured. The pH values of the broths were recorded. 3rd stage: the immersion broths were inoculated with suspensions of microorganisms, incubated, seeded on plates by dissemination and incubated. CFU counts were performed. RESULTS: points containing chlorhexidine showed inhibition zones with every microorganism in the 1st stage and, in the 2nd stage, with most of the microorganisms studied, except for Fn and Pi. Calcium hydroxide containing points did not inhibit any of the microorganisms assessed. Broth pH values did not exhibit any changes. CFU counts of the broths in which chlorhexidine points had been immersed showed total inhibition for all the microorganisms. The differences between materials were statistically significant (p<0.05) (ANOVA). In the conditions of this study, chlorhexidine-containing points proved to be effective against most of the tested strains.
TI  - A model of spontaneous periodontitis in the miniature goat.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis and progression of periodontal disease have been extensively studied through the use of animal models. However, no animal model has yet been established that is precisely similar to periodontitis in humans. In the present study, we examined the use of Shiba goats as a model for spontaneous periodontitis. METHODS: Thirty-four Shiba goats (seven males and 27 females, aged 10 to 98 months) were used. We examined periodontitis in Shiba goats clinically, histopathologically, and microbiologically. RESULTS: The mean probing depth (PD) of the 68 teeth examined was 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm. The incidences of PD > or =3 and 4 mm were 46.4% and 22.1%, respectively. The incidence of bleeding on probing in 68 sites and in 34 animals was 60.7% and 73.5%, respectively. The formation of vertical alveolar bone defects and downgrowth of gingival epithelial cells were found in the areas of periodontitis. The prevalence of Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque by polymerase chain reaction was 46.4%, 28.5%, 28.5%, 17.8%, and 3.5%, respectively. These percentages were increased in subgingival plaque from PD > or =3 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical, histopathological, and microbiological features of spontaneous periodontitis in Shiba goats were somewhat similar to those in human periodontitis. Moreover, there are some advantages of using the Shiba goat; the size of the oral cavity is suitable for periodontal treatment, and handling and housing are relatively easy. Therefore, these results suggest that the Shiba goat is a useful animal model for human periodontitis.
TI  - Supragingival plaque may modify the effects of subgingival bacteria on attachment loss.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial interactions in response to local and systemic factors may  explain important features of the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. This study evaluates the role of supragingival plaque level on the relationship between subgingival microorganisms and the risk of attachment loss. METHODS: The study population consisted of 386 white women aged 45 years and older who had at least seven teeth. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesio-buccal surface of six maxillary and six mandibular teeth using paper point technique. The samples were pooled, and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to identify the following target microorganisms: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Capnocytophaga species (Cs), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Eubacterium saburreum (Es), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). The presence or absence of supragingival plaque and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were assessed at the same 12 sites where subgingival plaque samples were taken. The association of each microorganism with CAL was tested using multiple logistic regressions controlling for age, smoking status, and diabetes. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: At low supragingival plaque levels, only the presence of Pg was significantly associated with CAL (OR: 6.41, 95% CI: 1.30 to 31.70); all remaining microorganisms were also associated with increased but non-significant risk of CAL. At high supragingival plaque levels, the presence of Tf (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.42 to 4.04) and Pg (OR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.63 to 8.42) was significantly associated with increased risk of attachment loss. By contrast, the presence of Cs (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.01) and Es (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.82) was associated with decreased risk of attachment loss. Fn, Pi, and Cr were not significantly associated with CAL at either low or high supragingival plaque levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the association of certain subgingival microorganisms with CAL changes in relation to supragingival plaque levels in older adult women. It also suggests that the overall effect of dental plaque is a function of the balance between pathogenic and other microorganisms that colonize this environment. Therefore, all microorganisms in the biofilm, including those with no apparent association with overt disease and those with negative associations, may play roles in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Sodium ion pumps and hydrogen production in glutamate fermenting anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria ferment glutamate via two different pathways to ammonia, carbon dioxide, acetate, butyrate and molecular hydrogen. The coenzyme B12-dependent pathway in Clostridium tetanomorphum via 3-methylaspartate involves pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and a novel enzyme, a membrane-bound NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The flavin- and iron-sulfur-containing enzyme probably uses the energy difference between reduced ferredoxin and NADH to generate an electrochemical Na+ gradient, which drives transport processes. The other pathway via 2-hydroxyglutarate in Acidaminococcus fermentans and Fusobacterium nucleatum involves glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase, which uses the free energy of decarboxylation to generate also an electrochemical Na+ gradient. In the latter two organisms, similar membrane-bound NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductases have been characterized. We propose that in the hydroxyglutarate pathway these oxidoreductases work in the reverse direction, whereby the reduction of ferredoxin by NADH is driven by the Na+ gradient. The reduced ferredoxin is required for hydrogen production and the activation of radical enzymes. Further examples show that reduced ferredoxin is an agent, whose reducing energy is about 1 ATP 'richer' than that of NADH.
TI  - Response of human macrophage-like cells to stimulation by Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Monocytes/macrophages are key members of the innate immune system and are present in higher numbers in active periodontal lesions than in inactive sites. The aim of this study was to characterize the response of human monocyte U937 cells, differentiated into adherent macrophages by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate, to stimulation by Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum lipopolysaccharide. Attachment of (3)H-lipopolysaccharide to macrophage-like cells was partially inhibited by anti-CD14 and anti-TLR4 polyclonal antibodies. Fusobacterial lipopolysaccharide did not cause cell apoptosis or block apoptosis induced by camptothecin. Lipopolysaccharide up-regulated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha as well as the chemokine interleukin-8 by macrophage-like cells. In addition, it increased phospholipase C and D activities, which likely contributed to the high levels of prostaglandin E(2) detected in the cell culture supernatant. Lastly, the amount of matrix metalloproteinase-9 produced by macrophage-like cells was significantly increased by the lipopolysaccharide treatment. Interestingly, fusobacterial cells acquired matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity following incubation in the presence of the culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage-like cells. In summary, the lipopolysaccharide of F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum has a large array of biological effects on macrophage-like cells. This monocytic responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide may be a key regulator of periodontitis.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. This study examined effects of macrocarpals A, B, and C on periodontopathic bacteria, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis. METHODS: Macrocarpals A, B, and C were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of Eucalyptus globules leaves. To investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. Macrocarpal inhibition of P. gingivalis Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The effect of macrocarpals on P. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with (3)H-labeled P. gingivalis. RESULTS: Growth of P. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of Prevotella intermedia or Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. Macrocarpals inhibited P. gingivalis Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. The enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by P. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. P. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. CONCLUSIONS: Macrocarpals A, B and C demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. Among tested bacteria, P. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. These results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.
TI  - Analysis of the antibacterial activity and plaque control benefit of colgate total dentifrice via clinical evaluation and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed, from a combined clinical and molecular biologic perspective, the antibacterial and antiplaque efficacy of Colgate Total dentifrice (CTD). METHODOLOGY: A single-blind crossover study design utilized 11 healthy human subjects. After a one-week washout period, subjects donated dental plaque, received a dental prophylaxis, and subsequently brushed with a test product. Twenty-four hours postbrushing, dental plaque was collected and a clinical plaque score determined. Dental plaque was submitted for Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real-time PCR) analysis. The same procedure was repeated in accordance with a crossover design for the use of the second test product. Following a one-week washout, a plaque donation, prophylaxis, and brushing with the test product ensued for each subject. Twenty-four hours post-brushing, the subjects returned for a plaque score and plaque donation. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after brushing, dental plaque coverage increased 17.88% +/- 8.27% with CTD, compared to 30.42% +/- 9.97% with Colgate Cavity Protection (CCP; p = 0.005). Real-time PCR found plaque collected 24 hours after brushing with CTD exhibited, on average, fewer representative periodontal pathogens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis) and fewer early colonizers (Actinomyces naeslundii) than plaque collected before brushing, whereas CCP showed a moderate effect on oral bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study provides clinical and molecular biological evidence to substantiate the antibacterial and plaque control benefits of Colgate Total, and suggests the value of combining a molecular biological method with clinical research to corroborate clinical benefits.
TI  - Folding kinetics of the outer membrane proteins OmpA and FomA into phospholipid bilayers.
AB  - The folding mechanism of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria into lipid bilayers has been studied using OmpA of E. coli and FomA of F. nucleatum as examples. Both, OmpA and FomA are soluble in unfolded form in urea and insert and fold into phospholipid bilayers upon strong dilution of the denaturant urea. OmpA is a structural protein and forms a small ion channel, composed of an 8-stranded transmembrane beta-barrel domain. FomA is a voltage-dependent porin, predicted to form a 14 stranded beta-barrel. Both OMPs fold into a range of model membranes of very different phospholipid compositions. Three membrane-bound folding intermediates of OmpA were discovered in folding studies with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers that demonstrated a highly synchronized mechanism of secondary and tertiary structure formation of beta-barrel membrane proteins. A study on FomA folding into lipid bilayers indicated the presence of parallel folding pathways for OMPs with larger transmembrane beta-barrels.
TI  - [Lemierre syndrome variant: Hepatic abscesses and hepatic venous thrombosis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum septicemia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Like Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum is capable  causing Lemierre's syndrome. Various locations of venous thrombosis have been described associated with Fusobacterium sp. septicemia. EXEGESIS: We describe a 43-year old alcoholic patient with F.nucleatum septicemia complicated with hepatic abscesses, middle hepatic venous thrombosis, osteomyelitis and infiltrative pneumonia. A pancreatic prosthesis was the only potentially identified infectious entrance. CONCLUSION: Our patient showed an alternative presentation of Lemierre's syndrome, a "digestive variant". To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusobacterium septicemia associated with hepatic venous thrombosis. This report is close to the cases of portal thrombosis and opens the clinical sphere of the lemierre's syndrome, whose incidence is increasing.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus mutans gtfC deficiency on mixed oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the influence of glucosyltransferase-gene-negative (gtf-) Streptococcus mutans strains unable to synthesize water-insoluble or soluble glucan on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of in vitro grown mixed oral biofilms. Biofilms modeling supragingival plaque consisted of Actinomyces naeslundii OMZ 745, Candida albicans OMZ 110, Fusobacterium nucleatum KP-F2, Streptococcus oralis SK 248, Veillonella dispar ATCC 17748T and one of the S. mutans strains UA159, OMZ 966, OMZ 937 or OMZ 977. Biofilms were grown anaerobically on sintered hydroxyapatite disks for 64.5 h at 37 degrees C. To perform confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses, microorganisms were stained with Syto 13 and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) with Calcofluor. Macromolecular diffusion properties were measured following timed biofilm exposure to Texas-Red-labeled 70-kDa dextran. Results showed that replacing wild-type S. mutans by a gtfC- mutant led to an increase in the volume fraction occupied by cells from 29 to 48% and a decrease of the EPS volume fraction from 51 to 33%. No such changes were observed when the S. mutans wild-type strain was replaced by a gtfB- or gtfD- mutant. The diffusion coefficient of 70-kDa dextran in biofilms containing the gtfC- S. mutans was 16-fold higher than in biofilms with the wild-type strain indicating a strong macromolecular sieving effect of GTF C-generated glucans. Our data demonstrate the influence of EPS on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of an oral biofilm model and uncover our still limited knowledge of the function of EPS in biofilms and plaque.
TI  - The microbiological origin of fluorescence observed in plaque on dentures during  QLF analysis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbiological origin of plaque fluorescence observed during quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) analysis. Plaque was sampled from dentures, because of easy accessibility and the homogeneous background provided by the denture tooth during imaging, and the acknowledged comparability to occlusal plaque. Forty removable poly(methyl methacrylate) dentures were screened for the presence of fluorescent plaque deposits during QLF analysis. Dentures were photographed, QLF images were recorded and samples of fluorescent plaque were taken. Plaque samples were cultured on fastidious anaerobe agar, Wilkins Chalgren agar and Sabourauds dextrose agar. Plates were screened under QLF and fluorescent colonies were subcultured and identified. Areas of red, orange and green fluorescence were detected on the fitting and non-fitting surfaces of dentures. The red and orange fluorescing species were Prevotella melaninogenica, Actinomyces israelii and Candida albicans, which are generally acknowledged to be secondary colonisers, present in more mature plaque. Green fluorescence was observed in streptococcal species (early colonisers) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (important organism in plaque development). Non-fluorescent colonies were also cultured. Plaque which accumulates on susceptible surfaces tends to be associated with caries, but it may be its maturity, rather than the presence of cariogenic streptococci, that is more likely to provide a microbiological link between red fluorescence and caries.
TI  - Pyogenic infections of the central nervous system secondary to dental affections--a report of six cases.
AB  - Pyogenic infections of the central nervous system of dental origin are quite uncommon in industrialized countries. We report six cases with intracerebral (n = 4) and intraspinal (n = 2) infections treated in our hospital. The microbial pathogen was successfully isolated in all patients. Fusobacterium nucleatum as well as Streptococcus species were found in three cases. Bacillus species were identified in two patients. Actinomyces was the etiologic agent in one case. All patients suffered from dental pathologies, so that after clinical and radiological exclusion of other sources an oral focus was presumed. Therapeutic management consisted of an operative procedure in order to obtain decompression, as well as evacuation of the pus on the one hand, followed by targeted antibiotics on the other. Clinical improvement was achieved in all patients, with one patient lost to follow-up. On magnetic resonance tomography, the inflammatory changes also disappeared in all cases. We recommend that oral infection with recurrent bacteraemia should always be considered in the pathogenesis of the so-called "cryptic" intracerebral and intraspinal infections.
TI  - Coaggregation of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum PK 1594 is  mediated by capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, two important periodontopathogens, is mediated by a galactoside on the surface of P. gingivalis and a lectin on F. nucleatum. In the present study, purified capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of P. gingivalis PK 1924 (serotype K5) were found to be able to bind to F. nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of F. nucleatum to P. gingivalis serotype K5. Sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of P. gingivalis serotype K5 CPS and LPS to the F. nucleatum lectin are: the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4 and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 6 of d-galactose. These data suggest that P. gingivalis serotype K5- CPS and LPS act as receptors mediating coaggregation between P. gingivalis and fusobacteria.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. The continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. Macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Escherichia coli. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Regulated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by LPS was evaluated by ELISA. Our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by LPS. This suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - The efficacy of povidone-iodine products against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - A total of 8 strains of 6 bacterial species, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277 and TDC286, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC29523 and JP2, Fusobacterium nucleatum No. 2, Tannerella forsythensis ATCC43937, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611 and Streptococcus anginosus ATCC33397, were treated with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) gargle (PVP-I: 0.47 and 0.23% w/v) or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) gargle (CHG: 0.002% w/v) for 15, 30 or 60 s, after which they were inoculated into various media, cultured and counted for residual bacteria. At both concentrations, PVP-I gargle reduced the viable cell count of all 8 bacterial strains to below the measurable limit within 15 s. By contrast, there were more than 1,000 viable colonies 60 s following treatment with the CHG gargle. The results demonstrate that povidone-iodine gargle has rapid bactericidal activity against the causative bacteria of periodontal disease.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Weissella cibaria isolates on the production of volatile sulphur compounds.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of Weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) production both in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on VSC production and Fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. Clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the VSC of their mouth air. RESULTS: These lactobacilli were identified as W. cibaria. These isolates inhibited the production of VSC by F. nucleatum (p<0.05). The concentration of F. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the W. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated W. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on F. nucleatum replication. In the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of H2S and CH3SH by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that W. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit VSC production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.
TI  - A sonographic short cervix as the only clinical manifestation of intra-amniotic infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A sonographically short cervix is a powerful predictor of spontaneous  preterm delivery. However, the etiology and optimal management of a patient with a short cervix in the mid-trimester of pregnancy remain uncertain. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) and intra-amniotic inflammation are frequently present in patients with spontaneous preterm labor or acute cervical insufficiency. This study was conducted to determine the rate of MIAC and intra-amniotic inflammation in patients with a cervical length < 25 mm in the mid-trimester. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients referred to our high risk clinic because of a sonographic short cervix or a history of a previous preterm birth. Amniocenteses were performed for the evaluation of MIAC and for karyotype analysis in patients with a short cervix. Fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as genital mycoplasmas. Patients with MIAC were treated with antibiotics selected by their physician. RESULTS: Of 152 patients with a short cervix at 14-24 weeks, 57 had amniotic fluid analysis. The prevalence of MIAC was 9% (5/57). Among these patients, the rate of preterm delivery (< 32 weeks) was 40% (2/5). Microorganisms isolated from amniotic fluid included Ureaplasma urealyticum (n=4) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n=1). Patients with a positive culture for Ureaplasma urealyticum received intravenous Azithromycin. Three patients with Ureaplasma urealyticum had a sterile amniotic fluid culture after treatment, and subsequently delivered at term. The patient with Fusobacterium nucleatum developed clinical chorioamnionitis and was induced. CONCLUSION: (1) Sub-clinical MIAC was detected in 9% of patients with a sonographically short cervix (< 25 mm); and (2) maternal parenteral treatment with antibiotics can eradicate MIAC caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum. This was associated with delivery at term in the three patients whose successful treatment was documented by microbiologic studies.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16S rRNA gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. Samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16S rRNA genes from DNA isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. Clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), Peptostreptococcus micros/Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone AJ062/BS044/FG014, Prevotella species, Dialister species, Mogibacterium species, Lachnospiraceae oral clone 55A-34, Filifactor alocis, Megasphaera sp. oral clone CS025/BS073, and Veillonella sp. oral clone BP1-85/Veillonella dispar/V. parvula. Bacteroides-like sp. oral clone X083/Bacteroidales oral clone MCE7_20 and Dialister sp. oral clone BS016/MCE7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. On the other hand, F. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, Prevotella intermedia, Dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. Bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. Overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. Molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of fusobacteria from Chinese and European patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases.
AB  - Phylogenetic and antigenic studies were performed on 48 human oral Fusobacterium  strains from Chinese patients with either necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) or gingivitis and on 23 Fusobacterium nucleatum or Fusobacterium periodonticum strains from European periodontitis patients. Alignment of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences resulted in a phylogenetic tree that corresponded well with the current classification of oral fusobacteria into F. periodonticum and several subspecies of F. nucleatum, in spite of much minor genetic variability. F. periodonticum, F. nucleatum subsp. animalis and a previously undescribed phylogenetic cluster (C4), that may represent an additional F. nucleatum subspecies, constituted discrete clusters distinct from the remainder of F. nucleatum with high bootstrap values. Chinese and European strains differed markedly with regard to their respective classification patterns, suggesting a predominance of F. peridonticum and F. nucleatum susp. animalis over F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme/vincentii in samples from China. Antigenic typing enabled the association of many previously described serovars with distinct phylogenetic clusters and when applied directly to uncultured clinical samples confirmed the differential distribution of oral Fusobacterium taxa in Chinese and European samples. Bacteria from cluster C4 and F. nucleatum subsp. animalis were significantly more prevalent and accounted for higher cell numbers in NUG than in gingivitis samples, suggesting a possible association of these rarely observed taxa with NUG in Chinese patients.
TI  - [Antibacterial effect of nHA-PA66 in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of nHA-PA66 on the predominant  bacteria of infected root canal in vitro. METHODS: Agar diffusion method was the testing method. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Fusobacteria nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Prevotalla intermedius (P. intermedius) were the tested bacteria. The powder and polymerized film of nHA-PA66 were the test mateials while the CCQ and filter paper as the control. RESULTS: nHA-PA66's powder showed good antebacterial effect on the P. gingivalis and P. intermedius, its film was weaker. Both of them had no effect on F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: nHA-PA66's antibacterial effect was not ideal, for better clinical results, some additives can be included.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of medicated root canal filling materials.
AB  - Bacteria remaining within the root canal system are a significant factor in endodontic failures. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha formulations against common endodontic pathogens. Standard, tetracycline, or iodoform (also called medicated gutta-percha; MGP) containing gutta-percha were tested against Actinomyces israelii, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum using the agar diffusion method. Resilon points and tetracycline disks/E-tests were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Resilon did not display antimicrobial properties. Standard gutta-percha and MGP inhibited F. nucleatum and A. naeslundii, with MGP also inhibiting A. israelii. Tetracycline containing gutta-percha was found to inhibit growth from all four bacterial species tested. The results of this study suggest that the use of tetracycline containing gutta-percha as an obturation material may be useful as a complement to the cleaning and disinfection phase of root canal procedures.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Heat shock protein (HSP) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. The present study was performed to evaluate Porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Recombinant P. gingivalis HSP60 was produced and purified from P. gingivalis GroEL gene. Rats were immunized with P. gingivalis HSP60, and experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: There was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-P. gingivalis HSP immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either P. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). Polymerase chain reaction data indicated that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that P. gingivalis HSP60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive Streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
AB  - Analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. Although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. We hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. Fusobacterium nucleatum is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. By contrast, Streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. F. nucleatum and S. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. Coincubation of KB or TERT-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of F. nucleatum and S. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of adherent and internalized streptococci. F. nucleatum also promoted invasion of KB cells by other oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii. Dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of S. cristatus to adherent and invading F. nucleatum. Inhibition of F. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased S. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. In addition, polyclonal antibodies to F. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both KB cells and S. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. Similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. These studies indicate that F. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.
TI  - Immediate effect of instrumentation on the subgingival microflora in deep inflamed pockets under strict plaque control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate (1) reduction in the number of microorganisms obtained  directly after subgingival instrumentation, (2) rate of bacterial re-colonization during 2 weeks, under supragingival plaque-free conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of subgingival instrumentation were measured at one deep pocket in 22 patients (11 smokers and 11 non-smokers). Immediately after initial therapy, experimental sites, under strict plaque control, were instrumented subgingivally. Microbiological evaluation was performed at pre-instrumentation, immediate post-instrumentation and 1 and 2 weeks post-instrumentation. RESULTS: Mean total anaerobic colony forming units (CFUs) dropped from 3.9 x 10(6) before to 0.09 x 10(6) immediately following instrumentation. Significant reductions were found for Tannerella forsythia, Micromonas micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum and spirochetes. Significant reductions were not observed for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus. Except for spirochetes, no reduction in prevalence of specific periodontal bacteria was found immediately after instrumentation. During follow-up, mean total CFU tended to increase. Prevalence of periodontal bacteria further reduced. No effect of smoking was found. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that subgingival mechanical cleaning in itself, has a limited effect, in actually removing bacteria. The subsequent reduction in prevalence of specific periodontal bacteria shows that it is apparently difficult for these species to survive in treated pockets.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess after colonoscopy in a patient with ulcerative colitis.
AB  
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - Effect of mineral trioxide aggregate on cytokine production by peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - AIM: To test the effect of two commercial brands of grey mineral trioxide aggregate (ProRoot and MTA-Angelus) on cytokine production by M1 and M2 inflammatory macrophages. METHODOLOGY: M1 (from C57BL/6 mice) and M2 peritoneal inflammatory macrophages (from C57BL/6 IL12p40-/- mice) were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of MTA. The cellular viability and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. Data were analysed by Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and anova tests. RESULTS: The cements did not interfere with cellular viability or with cytokine production by either type of macrophage. However, M2 macrophages produced higher levels of IL-10 when stimulated with F. nucleatum than M1 macrophages (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The brands of MTA evaluated did not interfere in the cytokine response by M1 or M2 macrophages to the two bacteria tested. However, a difference in cytokine production between the two types of macrophages was found.
TI  - Identification and localization of extraradicular biofilm-forming bacteria associated with refractory endodontic pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms have been found to develop on root surfaces outside the apical foramen and be associated with refractory periapical periodontitis. However, it is unknown which bacterial species form extraradicular biofilms. The present study aimed to investigate the identity and localization of bacteria in human extraradicular biofilms. Twenty extraradicular biofilms, used to identify bacteria using a PCR-based 16S rRNA gene assay, and seven root-tips, used to observe immunohistochemical localization of three selected bacterial species, were taken from 27 patients with refractory periapical periodontitis. Bacterial DNA was detected from 14 of the 20 samples, and 113 bacterial species were isolated. Fusobacterium nucleatum (14 of 14), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12 of 14), and Tannellera forsythensis (8 of 14) were frequently detected. Unidentified and uncultured bacterial DNA was also detected in 11 of the 14 samples in which DNA was detected. In the biofilms, P. gingivalis was immunohistochemically detected in all parts of the extraradicular biofilms. Positive reactions to anti-F. nucleatum and anti-T. forsythensis sera were found at specific portions of the biofilm. These findings suggested that P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and F. nucleatum were associated with extraradicular biofilm formation and refractory periapical periodontitis.
TI  - The major outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum (FomA) folds and inserts into lipid bilayers via parallel folding pathways.
AB  - Membrane protein insertion and folding was studied for the major outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum (FomA), which is a voltage-dependent general diffusion porin. The transmembrane domain of FomA forms a beta-barrel that is predicted to consist of 14 beta-strands. Here, unfolded FomA is shown to insert and fold spontaneously and quantitatively into phospholipid bilayers upon dilution of the denaturant urea, which was shown previously only for outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli. Folding of FomA is demonstrated by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by single-channel recordings. Refolded FomA had a single-channel conductance of 1.1 nS at 1 M KCl, in agreement with the conductance of FomA isolated from membranes in native form. In contrast to OmpA, which forms a smaller eight-stranded beta-barrel domain, folding kinetics of the larger FomA were slower and provided evidence for parallel folding pathways of FomA into lipid bilayers. Two pathways were observed independent of membrane thickness with two different lipid bilayers, which were either composed of dicapryl phosphatidylcholine or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. This is the first observation of parallel membrane insertion and folding pathways of a beta-barrel membrane protein from an unfolded state in urea into lipid bilayers. The kinetics of both folding pathways depended on the chain length of the lipid and on temperature with estimated activation energies of 19 kJ/mol (dicapryl phosphatidylcholine) and 70 kJ/mol (dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) for the faster pathways.
TI  - Streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  - Previously, we reported that intracellular Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. In this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using the same double-labeling techniques to identify Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, oral Campylobacter species, Eikenella corrodens, Treponema denticola, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. All those species were found within buccal cells. In every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. Streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (G. adiacens). This is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.
TI  - Coaggregation ability of Weissella cibaria isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum  and their adhesiveness to epithelial cells.
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the ability of Weissella cibaria isolated from the oral cavity to coaggregate with Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the adhesiveness of these strains to epithelial cells. W. cibaria efficiently coaggregated with F. nucleatum, and adhered to epithelial cells. We tested the effects of various factors on the coaggregation. The coaggregation and adhesiveness of W. cibaria disappeared upon exposure to pronase or LiCl, suggesting that proteinaceous components on the surface of W. cibaria mediated the coaggregation and adhesiveness. In conclusion, W. cibaria may serve as a potential probiotic with the ability to establish an oral flora protecting against oral pathogens.
TI  - Effect of sodium alendronate on alveolar bone resorption in experimental periodontitis in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and were shown to inhibit bone resorption in experimental periodontitis by unknown mechanisms. We studied the effect of the aminobisphosphonate sodium alendronate (SA) in experimental periodontitis. Wistar rats were subjected to ligature placement around the second upper left molars. METHODS: Animals were treated with SA 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg subcutaneously (sc), either 1 hour before (prophylactic) or starting 5 days after (therapeutic) periodontitis induction and daily until the rats were sacrificed (11 days). Controls received saline. Animals were weighed daily. Alveolar bone loss was measured as the difference (in millimeters) between the cusp tip and the alveolar bone. The periodontium and the surrounding gingivae were examined at histopathology, and the neutrophil influx into the gingivae was assayed using myeloperoxidase activity. The local bacterial flora was assessed through culture of the gingival tissue in standard aerobic and anaerobic media. RESULTS: Alveolar bone loss was significantly and dose dependently inhibited by SA either as a prophylactic or therapeutic treatment compared to the control. SA reduced tissue lesion at histopathology, with partial preservation of the periodontium, coupled to decreased myeloperoxidase activity compared to the control. The reduced neutrophil influx was also shown in carrageenan-induced peritonitis, used as a control experiment for this parameter. SA also significantly inhibited the growth of pigmented bacilli and Fusobacterium nucleatum, which are important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. SA also inhibited the in vitro growth of isolated Peptostreptococcus sp. CONCLUSION: Sodium alendronate preserves alveolar bone resorption and has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in experimental periodontitis.
TI  - Universal DNA primers amplify bacterial DNA from human fetal membranes and link Fusobacterium nucleatum with prolonged preterm membrane rupture.
AB  - A large number of bacterial species have been identified in fetal membranes after preterm labour (PTL) associated with intrauterine infection by microbiological culture. In this study, we have investigated a molecular and bioinformatic approach to organism identification which surmounts the need for specific and diverse microbiological culture conditions required by conventional methods. Samples of fetal membranes were taken from 37 preterm infants, and 6 normal term controls delivered by caesarean section, in which bacteria had been detected by in situ hybridization of 16S ribosomal RNA using a generic probe. Degenerate primers were designed to amplify bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA by PCR and used to amplify bacterial DNA from human fetal membranes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced and bacteria were identified bioinformatically by comparison of sequences with known bacterial DNA genomes. In situ hybridization using an organism specific probe was then used to confirm the presence of the commonest identified organism in tissue samples. Bacterial DNA amplified from 15/43 samples, all from preterm deliveries, and the bioinformatic approach identified organisms in all cases. Multiple bacteria were identified including Mycoplasma hominis, Pasturella multocida, Pseudomonas PH1, Escherichia coli and Prevotella bivia. The commonest organism Fusobacterium nucleatum was found in 9/15 (60%) of samples. Ten of the 12 samples obtained after prolonged membrane rupture were positive for bacterial DNA, and 7 of these (70%) contained DNA from F. nucleatum. Bacteria from fetal membranes may be identified by molecular and bioinformatic methods. Further work is warranted to investigate the apparent linkage between F. nucleatum, fetal membrane rupture and preterm delivery.
TI  - Antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection {PAD} used on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and in artificial and human root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection (PAD)  on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and root canals. METHODS: Four bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum,Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus intermedius, were tested in suspension. After mixing equal volumes of Tolonium chloride and bacterial suspension for 60s, each 200 microL of concentration (>10(6)cfu mL(-1)) was irradiated with light at 633+/-2 nm. Each energy dose/Tolonium chloride concentration combination was tested eight times, with controls. Prepared root canals in Training Blocs and extracted human teeth were inoculated with S. intermedius followed by 10 mg L(-1) Tolonium chloride or saline. Bacteria in canals were sampled before and after light irradiation. Student t-test assessed significance of changes in viable bacteria produced by treatment of either light or Tolonium chloride alone and light/Tolonium chloride combinations. RESULTS: In suspension, reductions in bacteria were highly significant (P<0.01) for light/Tolonium chloride combinations compared to light or Tolonium chloride alone. Maximum mean log reductions of 1.14 (P. intermedia), 2.48 (P. micros), 2.81 (F. nucleatum) and 6.73 (S. intermedius) were at 4.8 J/20 mg L(-1). Antibacterial action was increased by energy dose increase (not always significantly), but not by Tolonium chloride concentration. In control canals mean log reductions of 0.42 (Blocs) and 0.38 (teeth) from initial levels were not significant. PAD mean log reductions of 2.40 (Blocs) and 2.01 (teeth) were highly significant. Changes for PAD/energy dose combinations were not significant. CONCLUSION: PAD killed endodontic bacteria at statistically significant levels compared to controls. Kills varied with bacterial species.
TI  - Increased antibacterial activity of zinc polycarboxylate cement by the addition of chlorhexidine gluconate in fixed prosthodontics.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of water-activated zinc  polycarboxylate cement with adjunctive 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate on the subgingival microbiota in fixed partial dentures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six teeth prepared as fixed partial denture abutments in 9 patients were cemented randomly using water-activated zinc polycarboxylate cement (control group) or water-activated zinc polycarboxylate cement, including 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (test group). A total of 108 subgingival plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, immediately before permanent cementation (5 weeks), and 8 weeks later (at 13 weeks). RESULTS: In the control group, the subgingival microbiota altered to closely resemble the flora of chronic gingivitis (increased proportions of gram-negative anaerobes such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) by 13 weeks. In contrast, the microflora at test sites comprised predominantly gram-positive facultative cocci and rods at 13 weeks. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the addition of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate may enhance the antimicrobial action of polycarboxylate cements to ensure the maintenance of a microflora compatible with periodontal health, at least up to 13 weeks post-cementation.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyse the microbial flora in specific sites in 20 dentate (> or = 16 teeth) subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin and in 20 controls matched according to age, sex and number of teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial samples were analysed for the following micro-organisms: mutans streptococci, Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp., associated with the development of caries, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, frequently found in elevated numbers in periodontitis sites and Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, enterics and enterococci, associated with mucosal infections. The total microbial count was also registered, together with the total number of streptococci, associated with good oral health. RESULTS: In the hyposalivation group, the mean age was 54 +/- 8 years and the mean number of teeth 25 +/- 3. The unstimulated secretion rate was 0.04 +/- 0.04 mL/min and the stimulated secretion rate 0.98 +/- 0.51 mL/min. Compared with the controls, the hyposalivation group tended to harbour a lower number and proportion of F. nucleatum on the tongue, and an increased number of enterococci in the vestibular region. In the supragingival plaque, the numbers of Strepococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased and the number of C. albicans tended to be increased. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin have a supragingival plaque associated with the development of caries.
TI  - In vitro method to assess the antimicrobial activity and potential efficacy of novel types of wound dressings.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a simple, reproducible in vitro static diffusion method using cellulose disks and defined species to test antimicrobial efficacy of wound dressings. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cellulose disks were inoculated by immersion in cell suspensions of target species Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Test and control wound dressings were cut into equal sized squares (25 x 25 mm) and applied to the surface of 10-mm thick tryptone yeast extract agar on test beds. Following a 2-h equilibration period, inoculated cellulose disks were inserted (one per dressing) at the interface between dressing and agar surface and a small weight applied over each square. At various sampling times, disks were removed and surviving cells enumerated by viable counts. Disk to disk variation for microbial loading was assessed using S. epidermidis for both initial (n = 16) and standard treatment (n = 16) conditions. The coefficient of variation was low (<5%) indicating good reproducibility for cell loading and treatment position on the test bed. Replicate assays (n = 6) using S. epidermidis and oxyzyme gels produced similar kill rates with low scatter (R2 > 0.9) indicating good reproducibility between assays. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in kill rates were observed for different target species, types of dressing and test bed conditions (+/-blood and nutrients). CONCLUSIONS: The method is reproducible and useful in tracking the death kinetics of test species, enabling the comparison of different types of dressing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reported method has significant advantages over established test procedures; it can be applied equally across a wide range of target species (including anaerobes and yeasts), a wide range of conditions, and different types of surface dressings, including those relying upon oxygen diffusion.
TI  - Development of strain-specific PCR primers based on a DNA probe Fu12 for the identification of fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586T.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the strain-specificity of a DNA probe,  Fu12, for Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586T (F. nucleatum ATCC 25586T), and to develop sets of strain-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. Strain-specificity was tested against 16 strains of F. nucleatum and 3 strains of distinct Fusobacterium species. Southern blot hybridization revealed that the Fu12 reacted exclusively with the HindIII-digested genomic DNA of F. nucleatum ATCC 25586T. The results of PCR revealed that three pairs of PCR primers, based on the nucleotide sequence of Fu12, generated the strain-specific amplicons from F. nucleatum ATCC 25586T. These results suggest that the DNA probe Fu12 and the three pairs of PCR primers could be useful in the identification of F. nucleatum ATCC 25586T, especially with regard to the determination of the authenticity of the strain.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  - This aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various Nigerian chewing sticks. Aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of C. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in Nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. All the extracts demonstrated activity against Staphylococcal and Streptococcal isolates. Over half of the extracts were active against Enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas gigivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii. Extracts of the Vitellaria paradoxa root, Bridellia ferruginea stem and twigs, Garcinia cola stem, Terminalia glaucescens root, Morinda lucida root, and Cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. The extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.
TI  - Enhanced pathogenicity of Fusobacterium nucleatum adapted to oxidative stress.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an obligate anaerobic bacterium found in the indigenous human microbiota but also recovered from several anaerobic infections. Considering the biological and medical relevance of F. nucleatum, the characterization of its response to oxidative stress is needed in order to understand how this anaerobic bacterium survives during an invasive process of oxygenated tissues. Influence of oxidative stress by atmospheric oxygen exposure on cellular morphology and pathogenicity of F. nucleatum were investigated. The wild-type F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 (wt-strain) was exposed to oxidative stress to select an adapted strain (aero-strain). Conventional NIH Swiss mice were split in two experimental groups which were challenged intraperitoneally with wt-strain and aero-strain, respectively, and a control group, unchallenged. Histopathological and hyperemia analysis were performed by day 30 after infection. Gram stain of aero-strain showed drastic changes in cellular morphology when compared to wt-strain. A significant increase of liver weight/body weight ratio (P < 0.05) as well as a tendency (P = 0.16) to higher spleen weight/body weight ratio were observed for the mice challenged with aero-strain when compared to the two other animal groups. Additionally, these animals also showed hyperemia in the spleen and liver as well as an increased number of inflammatory cells and steatosis in the liver. The results showed that, in addition to extensive changes in cell morphology, the adaptation to oxidative stress might also influence the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum. These findings have clinical implications since in the host tissues this indigenous putative pathogen is exposed to more or less oxygenated environments found on the different anatomic sites invaded by the bacterium.
TI  - Efficient gene transfer and targeted mutagenesis in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe important in dental biofilm ecology and infectious diseases with significant societal impact. The lack of efficient genetic systems has hampered molecular analyses in this microorganism. We previously reported construction of a shuttle plasmid, pHS17, using the native fusobacterial plasmid pFN1 and an erythromycin resistance cassette. However, the host range of pHS17 was restricted to F. nucleatum, ATCC 10953, and the transformation efficiency was limited. This study was undertaken to improve genetic systems for molecular analysis in F. nucleatum. We identified a second F. nucleatum strain, ATCC 23726, which is transformed with improved efficiency compared to ATCC 10953. Two novel second generation pFN1-based shuttle plasmids, pHS23 and pHS30, were developed and enable transformation of ATCC 23726 at 6.2 x 10(4) and 1.5 x 10(6) transformants/mug plasmid DNA, respectively. The transformation efficiency of pHS30, which harbors a catP gene conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, was more than 1000-fold greater than that of pHS17. The improved transformation efficiency facilitated disruption of the chromosomal rnr gene using a suicide plasmid pHS19, the first demonstration of targeted mutagenesis in F. nucleatum. These results provide significant advances in the development of systems for molecular analysis in F. nucleatum.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of GroEL antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic infections such as those caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial GroEL with human heat shock protein (hHSP) 60. METHODS: We examined the cross-reactivity of anti-GroEL and anti-P. gingivalis antibodies with hHSP60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. RESULTS: After absorption of plasma samples with hHSP60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-GroEL and anti-P. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hHSP60. All of the artery specimens were positive for P. gingivalis. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, C. pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. The prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and T. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial HSPs including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hHSP60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.
TI  - Differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hBD) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (HGE) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: Several strains of the periodontopathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli. The induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also tested. RESULTS: In addition to the published observations (PMA induces hBD-2 and -4; TNF-alpha induces hBD-2 and -3), it was found that PMA can upregulate hBD-1 and hBD-3, whereas TNF-alpha can induce hBD-4. The commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hBD-2, hBD-3, and IL-8. The pathogen P. gingivalis induced hBD-1 and hBD-3 at different time points than the commensals, but no induction of IL-8 and hBD-2 could be observed. These data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. A correlation was found between the pathogenicity of different serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and IL-8. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.
TI  - The effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. The purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The outcomes that were studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. STUDY DESIGN: At 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or Escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). Surviving fetuses were delivered abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). RESULTS: When compared with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. Only 6 of 22 fetuses that were exposed to intra-amniotic Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14 fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). Fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. CONCLUSION: Lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. Sources of inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.
TI  - [Efficacy variation of erythromycin and spiramycin on periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis. An in vitro comparative study].
AB  - AIMS: Erythromycin (ERY) and spiramycin (SPI) are the most frequently prescribed  macrolides by dentists. However, the emergence of resistant anaerobic subgingival bacteria imposes an increased vigilance. This study aims to compare these macrolides efficacy on principal periopathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adult patients with aggressive periodontitis were selected and a total of 60 samples were taken from subgingival flora. Bacterial strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were isolated according to J. Slots's rapid identification method. The susceptibilities to ERY and SPI were studied using disk diffusion susceptibility test and minimum inhibitory concentration test (MIC test). RESULTS: The efficiency variability of ERY and SPI on the 50 isolated anaerobic periopathogens was present either interindividually (between different patients) and intra-individually (within the same patient). While 68% of the tested anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to SPI (22% resistant), only 54% were sensitive to ERY (34% resistant). Although moderate, the efficacy of SPI seemed more regular in general than ERY: it's variation coefficient (40%) is lower than the ERY one (53%). The 7 A. actinomycetemcomitans tested showed all a high resistance. CONCLUSION: In a general way, the spectre of activity of SPI is stacked in that of ERY. However, this study shows a better and regular activity of SPI on the main tested periopathogens. These results are in favour of the use of SPI in periodontology when penicillins and doxycycline are not useful because specific problems are identified (allergy, pregnancy...).
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum apoptosis-inducing outer membrane protein.
AB  - The periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum induces apoptosis in lymphocytes. We previously identified the autotransporter protein Fap2 in F. nucleatum strain PK1594 that induced apoptosis in lymphocytes when expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study, we identified protein homologs of Fap2 in the transformable F. nucleatum strain ATCC 23726, to determine their role in the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes. We used a new gene-inactivation vector conferring thiamphenicol resistance (pHS31) to construct a mutant deficient in one of the homologs, aim1. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated disruption of aim1 expression, and phenotypic analyses revealed a 41% decrease in the ability of the mutant to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells, as compared with the parental strain. These studies demonstrate, in the native host cell background, the contribution of aim1 to F. nucleatum induction of apoptosis and, to the best of our knowledge, represent the first report of a genetically defined and phenotypically characterized mutation in F. nucleatum.
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis due to Fusobacterium species: report of three cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We describe three cases of Fusobacterium spp. diskitis and review with attention  to risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. In most of the reported cases, a ear-nose-throat infection was found. Clinical manifestations were similar to those of classic bacterial vertebral osteomyelitis. Clindamycin is the most appropriate antibiotic. The outcome seems to be very good without relapse with appropriate treatment compared to pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel adhesin unique to oral fusobacteria.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe that is prevalent in periodontal disease and infections of different parts of the body. The organism has remarkable adherence properties, binding to partners ranging from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to extracellular macromolecules. Understanding its adherence is important for understanding the pathogenesis of F. nucleatum. In this study, a novel adhesin, FadA (Fusobacterium adhesin A), was demonstrated to bind to the surface proteins of the oral mucosal KB cells. FadA is composed of 129 amino acid (aa) residues, including an 18-aa signal peptide, with calculated molecular masses of 13.6 kDa for the intact form and 12.6 kDa for the secreted form. It is highly conserved among F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, the three most closely related oral species, but is absent in the nonoral species, including Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium russii, and Fusobacterium ulcerans. In addition to FadA, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and ATCC 49256 also encode two paralogues, FN1529 and FNV2159, each sharing 31% identity with FadA. A double-crossover fadA deletion mutant, F. nucleatum 12230-US1, was constructed by utilizing a novel sonoporation procedure. The mutant had a slightly slower growth rate, yet its binding to KB and Chinese hamster ovarian cells was reduced by 70 to 80% compared to that of the wild type, indicating that FadA plays an important role in fusobacterial colonization in the host. Furthermore, due to its uniqueness to oral Fusobacterium species, fadA may be used as a marker to detect orally related fusobacteria. F. nucleatum isolated from other parts of the body may originate from the oral cavity.
TI  - Efficacy of photodynamic therapy on inflammatory signs and two selected periodontopathogenic species in a beagle dog model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current research aims to find alternatives to conventional methods for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be a suitable treatment procedure of periodontal infections. METHODS: In the present study, the PDT method was tested with two photosensitizers, chlorine e6 and BLC1010, in an experiment on beagle dogs. The animals were infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in all subgingival areas. After infection, we observed clinical signs of gingival inflammation, including an increase of redness and bleeding on probing. Microbiological monitoring before and after treatment was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PDT was conducted with a diode laser with a wavelength of 662 nm using a power of 0.5 W and the photosensitizers. RESULTS: The PDT procedure carried out with either of the photosensitizers caused a significant reduction in the clinical inflammation signs of redness and BOP, compared to the controls (laser only and no treatment). Furthermore, PDT with chlorine e6 caused a significant reduction in P. gingivalis-infected sites, whereas there was a lack in suppression after PDT with BLC1010. F. nucleatum could hardly be reduced with chlorine e6, and only to a certain extent with BLC 1010 and laser only. In the control groups, the Pg-infected test sites did not change. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the photodynamic therapy using photosensitizer and a 662 nm laser light source is distinctly advantageous in reducing the periodontal signs of redness and bleeding on probing. The procedure also appears to significantly suppress P. gingivalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in The Netherlands and Spain.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Antimicrobial resistance of periodontal pathogens towards currently used antibiotics in periodontics has been investigated in a previous study. Microbial resistance in the periodontal microflora was more frequently observed in Spanish patients in comparison with Dutch patients. The aim of the present study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of five periodontal bacteria isolated from periodontitis patients in Spain and in The Netherlands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from adult patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and non-selective plates. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Micromonas micros were isolated and used for minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the Epsilometer (E-test) technique. Eight different antibiotics were tested on all bacterial isolates. MIC50 and MIC90 values for each antibiotic and each species were determined and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. RESULTS: Significantly higher MIC values were noted in Spanish strains of F. nucleatum for penicillin, ciprofloxacin, of P. intermedia for penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline, of M. micros for tetracycline, amoxicillin and azithromycin, and of P. gingivalis for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Based on breakpoint concentrations, a higher number of resistant strains in Spain were found in F. nucleatum for penicillin, amoxicillin and metronidazole, in Prevotella intermedia for tetracycline and amoxicillin, and in A. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin and azithromycin. Resistance of P. gingivalis strains was not observed for any of the antibiotics tested both in Spain and The Netherlands. CONCLUSIONS: Differences exist in the susceptibility profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in Spain and in The Netherlands. This implicates that antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary to determine efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Also, clinical studies with antibiotics should take these differences into account. The information from the present study indicates that it may not be possible to develop uniform protocols for usage of antibiotics in the treatment of severe periodontitis in the European Union.
TI  - An antibacterial surface on dental implants, based on the photocatalytic bactericidal effect.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that the moderately roughened surfaces of dental implants enhance direct bone-implant contact. However, rough implant surfaces, as compared to smooth surfaces, are thought to pose a higher risk of bacterial infection when exposed to the oral cavity. PURPOSE: This study was focused on evaluating the photocatalytic bactericidal effects of anatase titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) on gram-negative anaerobic bacteria known to be associated with periimplantitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A film of photocatalytic anatase TiO(2) was added onto the surface of commercially pure titanium disks by plasma source ion implantation (PSII) followed by annealing. The photocatalytic properties of the film were confirmed by the degradation of methylene blue. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum cells were incubated anaerobically and seeded on the disk. The disks were then exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) illumination from black light in an anaerobic environment. After illumination, the number of viable cells was counted in terms of colony-forming units. RESULTS: The anatase TiO(2) film added by the PSII method and annealing exhibited a strong photocatalytic reaction under UVA illumination. The viability of both types of bacteria on the photocatalytic TiO(2) film was suppressed to less than 1% under UVA illumination within 120 minutes. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal effect of the TiO(2) photocatalyst is of great use for sterilizing the contaminated surface of dental implants.
TI  - Protein secretion systems in Fusobacterium nucleatum: genomic identification of Type 4 piliation and complete Type V pathways brings new insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis.
AB  - Recent genomic analyses of the two sequenced strains F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii ATCC 49256 suggested that the major protein secretion systems were absent. However, such a paucity of protein secretion systems is incongruous with F. nucleatum pathogenesis. Moreover, the presence of one or more such systems has been described for every other Gram-negative organism sequenced to date. In this investigation, the question of protein secretion in F. nucleatum was revisited. In the current study, the absence in F. nucleatum of a twin-arginine translocation system (TC #2.A.64.), a Type III secretion system (TC #3.A.6.), a Type IV secretion system (TC #3.A.7.) and a chaperone/usher pathway (TC #1.B.11.) was confirmed. However, contrary to previous findings, our investigations indicated that a Type I protein secretion system was also absent from F. nucleatum. In contrast, members of the holin family (TC #1.E) and the machinery required for a Type 4 piliation/fimbriation system (TC #3.A.15.2.) were identified using a variety of bioinformatic tools. Furthermore, a complete range of proteins resembling members of the Type V secretion pathway, i.e., the Type Va (autotransporter; TC #1.B.12.), Type Vb (two-partner secretion system; TC #1.B.20.) and Type Vc (YadA-like trimeric autotransporter; TC #1.B.42.), was found. This work provides new insight into the protein secretion and virulence mechanisms of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Fluorescence based measurements of Fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregation and of fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral anaerobe associated with gingivitis, periodontal disease and preterm deliveries. Coaggregation among oral bacteria is considered to be a significant factor in dental plaque development. Adhesion to host cells was suggested to be important for the F. nucleatum virulence associated with oral inflammation and with preterm births. An uncharacterized fusobacterial galactose inhibitible adhesin mediates coaggregation of F. nucleatum 12230 and F. nucleatum PK1594 with the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. This adhesin is also involved with the attachment of both fusobacterial strains to host cells. However, it has been suggested that additional unidentified fusobacterial adhesins are involved in F. nucleatum virulence associated with preterm births. In this study, a fluorescence-based high throughput sensitive and reproducible method was developed for measuring bacterial coaggregation and bacterial attachment to mammalian cells. Using this method we found that coaggregation of F. nucleatum 4H with P. gingivalis and its attachment to murine macrophages is less inhibitible by galactose than that of F. nucleatum PK1594. These findings suggest that F. nucleatum 4H can serve as a model organism for identifying nongalactose inhibitible F. nucleatum adhesins considered to be involved in fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a Chilean population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Other periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in Chilean patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (CP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (RTF) and cultured. Periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. The identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: AgP showed a significatively higher prevalence of C. rectus than CP (P = 0.036). The only statistical difference found was for C. rectus. Patients with AgP showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. A similar prevalence in both groups of patients was observed for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia/nigrescens, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in AgP than CP patients. In localized AgP, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and P. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized AgP patients who harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: C. rectus, P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of AgP in this Chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between AgP and CP was for C. rectus, suggesting that the differences in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. In this study, the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Comparison of culture and real-time PCR for detection and quantification of five  putative periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial cultivation is a well-established method for analyzing plaque samples. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a novel rapid method for the identification and quantification of periodontopathogenic bacteria that has been recently introduced. In this study, we compared real-time PCR with conventional anaerobic cultivation. METHOD: A total of 78 subgingival plaque samples were harvested from pockets > or =5 mm in 22 patients with advanced chronic periodontitis and immediately transferred into transport medium. Aliquots were evaluated with species-specific probes by real-time PCR (meridol Perio Diagnostics, GABA) and anaerobic bacteria culture on selective media for the detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythensis. The analysis was performed by two separate, blinded examiners. RESULTS: When real-time PCR was compared with the culture method (golden standard) for the detection of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, the sensitivity and specificity for A. actinomycetemcomitans were 67% and 100%, respectively (kappa: 0.79); for F. nucleatum 73% and 53%, respectively (kappa: 0.21); for P. gingivalis 94% and 84%, respectively (kappa: 0.77); for P. intermedia 33% and 94%, respectively (kappa: 0.26) and for T. forsythensis 92% and 56%, respectively (kappa: 0.51). Spearman's correlation coefficients for the quantitative results of both methods were 0.82 for A. actinomycetemcomitans, 0.33 for F. nucleatum, 0.83 for P. gingivalis, 0.38 for P. intermedia and 0.67 for T. forsythensis. CONCLUSION: Overall, the agreement between both test methods was excellent for A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, fair for T. forsythensis and poor for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The discrepancies in the results may be explained by the inability of cultivation methods to distinguish between close related taxa, and the problems of keeping periopathogenic bacteria viable, which is required for standard cultivation.
TI  - Mechanism of visible light phototoxicity on Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Phototoxicity of visible light laser on the porphyrin-producing bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, in the absence of photosensitizers and under aerobic conditions was shown in previous studies. Recently, we found that the noncoherent visible light sources at wavelengths of 400-500 nm, commonly used in restorative dentistry, induced a phototoxic effect on P. gingivalis, as well as on Fusobacterium nucleatum, and to a lesser extent on the Streptococci sp. To elucidate the mechanism of this phototoxic effect, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were exposed to light (1) under aerobic and anaerobic environments and (2) in the presence of scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phototoxic effect was not observed when the bacteria were exposed to light under anaerobic conditions. Dimethyl thiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, was effective in reducing phototoxicity (P </= 0.05). Other scavengers, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbic acid, were less effective when applied separately. These results support the assumption that the phototoxic effect of blue light on the periopathogenic bacteria is oxygen dependent and that hydroxyl radicals play an important role in this process.
TI  - Multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. Our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. METHODS: The oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. Biofilm growth involved super-infection by F. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by Streptococcus sanguis. RESULTS: Zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by F. nucleatum cells in suspensions with ID(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mM. The ID(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mM. Inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. Zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by P. intermedia with ID(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mM, respectively. Respiration of intact cells of F. nucleatum and NADH oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with ID(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mM. Zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by F. nucleatum (ID(50) = ca. 0.04 mM.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. CONCLUSION: Zn(2+) is a potent inhibitor of catabolism by F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. Zn(2+) also inhibits O(2) metabolism of F. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.
TI  - Fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  - Successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. Specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. Fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. Excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. Marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. We postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. Pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue categories. Each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.
TI  - Microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. Twenty uniradicular teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. For molecular diagnosis a DNA chip with 20 different species-specific, 16S-rDNA-directed catcher probes was used. The microorganisms most frequently detected by the DNA chip were: Micromonas micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Veillonella parvula, Eubacterium nodatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Streptococcus constellatus. As expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as T. forsythia and T. denticola could not be identified. In conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility variation of 50 anaerobic periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis: an interindividual variability study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The frequent use of antibiotics in developed countries has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. In this study, the interindividual variability of the antibiotic susceptibility of 50 putative microorganisms in aggressive periodontitis patients has been evaluated by means of VC (variation coefficient). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 microbial samples were collected from 20 adult patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (2-4 samples by patient). Bacterial strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros were isolated according to Slots' rapid identification method. The susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics were studied: penicillin G (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC), tetracycline (TET), doxycycline (DOX), ciprofloxacin (CIP), erythromycin (ERY), spiramycin (SPI) and clindamycin (CLIN), using the Disk Diffusion Susceptibility test (DDS test: Kirby-Bauer's modified method for anaerobic bacteria). The broth microdilution Minimum Inhibitory Concentration test was carried out as a control test. RESULTS: Among the 50 identified bacteria, 15 were P. gingivalis, 12 P. intermedia, 8 T. forsythia, 9 F. nucleatum, and 6 P. micros. The results of the DDS test show that penicillins (especially AMC, AMP, and AMX), cyclines (especially DOX) and CLIN are highly effective against the 50 anaerobic studied bacteria. CIP and ERY have the lowest efficacy against those bacteria. CIP shows a very variable activity according to anaerobic bacteria species, being particularly inactive against P. gingivalis and very efficient against T. forsythia and P. micros. SPI is also highly efficient but not against P. micros. CONCLUSIONS: The interindividual susceptibility of principal periodontal pathogens to antibiotics is not homogeneous and seems to vary according to bacterial species and antimicrobial molecules. This variability seems to be greater with older molecules (PEN, TET, ERY) than with more recent ones, which indicates more stable results (AMC, AMX, AMP, and DOX). P. intermedia appeared to be the bacteria most resistant to penicillins and showed the highest coefficient variation. Together with scaling and root planing, the combination of two antibiotics would therefore seem to be recommended in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis, particularly in the presence of P. intermedia.
TI  - Molecular identification of an invasive gingival bacterial community.
AB  - A woman with neutropenia developed gingival hyperplasia. Biopsy showed invasion of gingival tissue with mats of filamentous organisms, and molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed Capnocytophaga sputigena, Leptotrichia species, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Oral bacterial flora may cause invasive gingival disease with hyperplasia in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Identification of cultivable microorganisms from primary endodontic infections with exposed and unexposed pulp space.
AB  - This study was aimed at comparing the cultivable microorganisms in canals with periapical radiolucencies with exposed and unexposed pulp space. Microbiological samples were taken and analyzed from 45 canals with exposed pulp space, and 43 canals with unexposed pulp space. The canal contents were analyzed by aerobic/anaerobic culture, and conventional identification techniques. There were 211 isolates of bacteria belonging to 28 genera and 55 species recovered from exposed canals. In the unexposed group, 185 isolates of bacteria were recovered, of which 54 species of 28 genera were identified. Among the four most common genera, Prevotella was significantly more common in the exposed group (51/211 in the exposed group versus 30/185 in the unexposed group) (p = 0.049), while there were no differences in prevalence of Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcus, and Campylobacter between two groups of canals. In addition, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acne were significantly more common in the unexposed canals (p = 0.047 and p = 0.0051, respectively). Similarity in bacterial species in these two groups suggests that pulp space exposure may not be a significant factor in determining the type of bacteria present in infected canals.
TI  - Microbial changes in conjunctival flora with 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel contact lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel contact lenses on the conjunctival flora in asymptomatic wearers. METHODS: The authors studied 29 eyes of 15 patients wearing Focus NIGHT & DAY silicone hydrogel contact lenses for up to 30 nights of continuous wear. The average age of the patients was 25.54 +/- 8.98 years. Cultures of the inferior cul-de-sac were taken bilaterally from all eyes, before and after lens wear in asymptomatic patients. The isolation and identification of bacteria were made by standard clinical laboratory methods. RESULTS: The number of eyes whose conjunctival cultures were sterile before using the lenses significantly decreased (P = 0.0005), and the number of eyes with a growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroid rods in their conjunctival cultures significantly increased after using these lenses (P = 0.001 and P = 0.031, respectively). Conversely, a statistically significant difference was not found in the number of eyes that carried Propionibacterium acnes and Fusobacterium nucleatum in their conjunctival cultures before and after using the 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel lenses (P = 0.998 and P = 0.488, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the sterility of the conjunctiva significantly decreased after using 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel contact lenses. In addition, the number of bacteria of the normal conjunctival flora significantly increased after the use of these lenses. Contamination by the bacteria of the eyelids may be a possible colonization factor in this study group. Therefore, it is appropriate to examine the patients who wear these lenses more frequently.
TI  - Susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and LL37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. The susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. METHODS: Synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, hBD3 and LL37 (CAP18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. They included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6), Prevotella intermedia (7), Fusobacterium nucleatum (7), Streptococcus mutans (5), Streptococcus sobrinus (5), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus sanguis (4), Streptococcus mitis (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). RESULTS: Although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. The antibacterial activity of hBD1 was lower than that of the other peptides. Among the bacteria tested in this study, F. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hBD3 and LL37, and S. mutans was highly susceptible to hBD3. We measured the Zeta-potential, representing the net charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. Although we found some correlation in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that beta-defensins and LL37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.
TI  - Tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian population.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. For each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Tannerella forsythensis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponoma denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and Streptococcus intermedius. Two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). RESULTS: The prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. At score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. The depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. When the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: No major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.
TI  - Failed dental implants - clinical, radiological and bacteriological findings in 17 patients.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reasons for implant failure in two Oral and Maxillofacial Units in Helsinki. Seventeen patients, who lost 30 implants were included in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients and implants were studied clinically, radiologically and microbiologically. RESULTS: Most patients did not have any symptom indicating failure; hence, the failures were noticed mainly by the clinicians when instability of the fixture or of the prosthetic reconstruction became obvious. Radiolucency around the fixture was the most frequent radiological finding. Twenty per cent of the fixtures were located in insufficient bone. Ninety seven per cent of the bacterial cultures were positive, Streptococcus milleri being the most commonly identified aerobic and Fusobacterium nucleatum the most commonly anaerobic bacteria. CONCLUSION: The most critical time for success is immediately after prosthetic loading. Hence, implants should be placed in the optimal position to facilitate prosthetic reconstruction and loading.

TI  - Treponema medium glycoconjugate inhibits activation of human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with phenol-water extracts of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Oral treponemes are well-known as causative agents of periodontal diseases; however, the details have not been fully clarified. Here, we examined the effects of Treponema medium glycoconjugate on the activation of human gingival fibroblasts using phenol-water extracts from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The phenol-water extracts activated human gingival fibroblasts to mediate IL-8 production, as well as IL-8 mRNA expression, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. T. medium glycoconjugate exhibited no activation of human gingival fibroblasts, while phenol-water extract-induced activation of human gingival fibroblasts was clearly inhibited by T. medium glycoconjugate. Furthermore, binding of biotinylated phenol-water extracts to CD14 in the presence of LPS-binding protein was blocked with T. medium glycoconjugate. These results suggest that T. medium glycoconjugate has an inhibitory effect on host cell activation by periodontopathic bacteria caused by binding to CD14- and LPS-binding protein.
TI  - Detection of heat shock proteins but not superantigen by isolated oral bacteria from patients with Behcet's disease.
AB  - We isolated bacteria from periodontal sites and mixed saliva in eight patients with Behcet's disease and surveyed them to determine whether they produced heat shock proteins (HSPs) and superantigen. Cultivable bacterial compositions from periodontal sites and saliva were examined by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates. Gram-negative anaerobic rods such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Capnocytophaga species were predominant in the isolates from the subgingival plaque samples. The Streptococcus mitis group was the most common type isolated from the saliva samples. To detect the production of HSPs, Western blot analyses were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody to Escherichia coli DnaK and a monoclonal antibody to Helicobacter pylori Gro-EL. Sonic extracts of 27 of the strains (79.4%) reacted with the antibody against E. coli DnaK. Nine of these 34 strains (26.5%) were found to produce HSPs that reacted with antibody to H. pylori Gro-EL. A total of 54 isolates were examined for superantigen activity against human peripheral leukocytes. Twenty-five gram-negative clinical strains isolated from chronic periodontitis lesions and 20 ATCC strains of microorganisms were also examined. We could not detect any superantigen activity in 500x diluted supernatant of the strains isolated from the eight patients with Behcet's disease. The present study indicates that the anaerobic strains isolated from the oral cavity of these patients produce HSPs, the production being related to Bechet's disease.
TI  - Effect of khat chewing on 14 selected periodontal bacteria in sub- and supragingival plaque of a young male population.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The habit of chewing khat (Catha edulis) for its amphetamine-like effects is highly prevalent in Yemen and east Africa, and has expanded to Western countries. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence and levels of 14 periodontal bacteria in gingival plaque of khat chewers and khat nonchewers, as well as of khat chewing sides and khat nonchewing sides. METHODS: A total of 408 sub- and supragingival plaque samples were collected from 51 young males (29 khat chewers and 22 khat nonchewers; age range 19-28 years) and analyzed using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical parameters were recorded for all teeth at six sites per tooth. RESULTS: Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella parvula were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival plaque of chewers, which also showed significantly higher levels of V. parvula and Eikenella corrodens. Similar results were found for the subgingival plaque of the chewing sides compared to the nonchewing sides. However, there was a significantly higher prevalence and higher levels of Tannerella forsythia in the subgingival plaque of the nonchewing sides. No significant differences were observed for the supragingival plaque between the two study groups. There was a significantly lower prevalence of Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in the khat chewing sides, and higher levels of V. parvula and Actinomyces israelii. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that khat chewing induces a microbial profile that is not incompatible with gingival health.
TI  - Association of a novel high molecular weight, serine-rich protein (SrpA) with fibril-mediated adhesion of the oral biofilm bacterium Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - The surface of the oral plaque bacterium Streptococcus cristatus is decorated with a lateral tuft of fibrils. The fibrillar tuft functions in the adhesion of S. cristatus to heterologous bacterial species in the plaque biofilm. The tuft typically consists of a densely packed fringe of shorter fibrils 238 +/- 19 nm long with longer, less abundant fibrils 403 +/- 66 nm long projecting through the fringe of short fibrils. The two types of fibrils in the tufts of S. cristatus have been refractory to biochemical separation, complicating their characterization. A hexadecane partition assay was used to enrich for subpopulations of S. cristatus CR311 (type strain NCTC 12479) having distinct fibrillar morphotypes. Negative staining in the TEM revealed that cells of a hydrophobic subpopulation of S. cristatus (CR311var1) carried only the long fibrils (395 +/- 32 nm). A hydrophilic subpopulation of S. cristatus (CR311var3) consisted of mixed morphotypes having no fibrils or remnant short fibrils (223 +/- 49 nm). No long fibrils were observed on any cells in the CR311var3 subpopulation. The CR311var3 morphotype, unlike the wild-type strain and CR311var1, was not able to form corncobs with either Corynebacterium matruchotii or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Variant CR311var3 did not express the novel gene srpA, which encodes a high molecular weight (321,882 Da) serine-rich protein, SrpA. The SrpA protein contains two extensive repeat motifs of 17 and 71 amino acids and a gram-positive cell wall anchor consensus sequence (LPNTG). The unusual properties of SrpA most closely resemble those of Fap1, the fimbrial-associated adhesin protein of Streptococcus parasanguis. The association of long fibrils, high surface hydrophobicity, ability to form corncob formations, and expression of the srpA gene suggest that SrpA is a long fibril protein in S. cristatus.
TI  - DNA probe identification of bacteria colonizing internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface: a preliminary study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the specific genus and species of bacteria that may colonize internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface (IAI) of two-stage dental implants. The purpose of this study was to use DNA probe analysis to identify those periodontopathic bacteria that may inhabit the internal surfaces and healing abutment screw-threads of the IAI of dental implants in situ. METHODS: Following osseointegration, bacterial samples for DNA probe analysis were obtained from 54 two-stage hydroxyapatite plasma spray-coated implants in 32 patients. Using sterile paper points, samples were obtained from the IAI of 43 implants and the screw-threads of healing abutments in the other 11 implants. DNA probes were available to detect the following microbes: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola. RESULTS: All samples taken from healing abutment screw-threads were negative for all target microbes. The aggregate percentage of positive results for each target microbe for samples from internal surfaces of the IAI were: 41.9%, A. actinomycetemcomitans, 60.5%, T. forsythensis; 44.2%, C rectus; 60.5%, E. corrodens; 48.8%, F. nucleatum; 46.5%, P. gingivalis; 55.8%, P. intermedia; and 51.2%, T. denticola. In addition, no significant differences were noted between colonization of individual microbial species when comparing anterior to posterior and maxillary to mandibular implant sites. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to high levels of eight different periodontopathic microbes inhabiting the internal surfaces of the IAI of 43 two-stage implants in partially edentulous patients were identified by DNA probe analysis. The microbes colonized these surfaces within 25 days following the second stage surgery and placement of the healing abutment. In contrast, all samples obtained from screw-threads of 11 healing abutments were DNA probe negative. These findings appear to support those of other investigations demonstrating the translocation of bacteria from residual dentition to implants.
TI  - Differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Seoul, South Korea. South Korean samples were frozen and delivered to Brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. DNA was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect 7 target bacterial species. RESULTS: The most prevalent species detected in Brazilian samples were Porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases) , Treponema denticola (79%), and Dialister pneumosintes (76%). The most prevalent species found in South Korean samples were Fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , Tannerella forsythia (26%), and Treponema maltophilum (24%). Overall, P endodontalis, D pneumosintes, Filifactor alocis, T denticola, and T forsythia were significantly more detected in Brazilian samples than in South Korean samples ( P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.
TI  - Towards a resolution on the inherent methodological weakness of the "effective number of codons used by a gene".
AB  - Recently Anders Fuglsang provided a modified way for calculating N(c) when biased discrepancy is present in a gene [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 317 (2004) 957]. Instead of taking the average codon homozygosity for each synonymous family type (as proposed by Wright) [Gene 87 (1990) 23] Fuglsang considered codon homozygosity of each amino acid individually. Marsashi and Najafabadi [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 324 (2004) 1] in their recent article demonstrated that the readjustment for overestimation at the level of individual amino acids results in loss of considerable amount of information. Immediately after the publication of Marsashi and Najafabadi, Fuglsang proposed that codon homozygosities can be calculated based on the classical population genetics [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 327 (2005) 1]. Though Fuglsang's approach is a novel one, it fails when any of the amino acids are absent in a gene. However, the inherent cause of overestimation at the level of individual amino acids is still obscured in the literature. Here in this communication we have presented a general condition where effective number of codons is overestimated using Wright's formula and also we propose a new way to calculate N(c), which is independent of amino acid composition.

TI  - Bacteria recovered from dental pulp induce apoptosis of lymph node cells.
AB  - Apoptosis is critical in the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases. The induction of apoptosis was assessed in mouse lymph node cells by four bacteria recovered from infected human dental pulp: Gemella morbillorum, Clostridium butyricum, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Smaller lymph nodes and smaller numbers of cells were observed after experimental dental pulp infection with C. butyricum, suggesting that this bacterium induces cell death. Apoptosis was evaluated by determination of cell ploidy and detection of DNA degradation in cells cultured with killed bacteria. Paraformaldehyde-killed C. butyricum and heat-killed G. morbillorum induced substantial cell death, while F. nucleatum and B. adolescentis induced cell death at lower levels. No bacterial preparations induced apoptosis in cells from mice genetically deficient for tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 (TNFRp55), implicating this receptor directly or indirectly as a mediator in the process. It was concluded that apoptosis may be induced during periapical lesions of pulpal origin.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of antibiotic therapy in dentistry and  stomatology].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) criteria. METHODS: A complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the MIC90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. Pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. For drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above MIC (t > MIC) was calculated. For drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the AUC/MIC was calculated. RESULTS: Amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. The spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation Rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory PK/PD indexes. CONCLUSION: PK/PD indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. The PK/PD simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. Clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.
TI  - Quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia (formerly Bacteroides forsythus or Tan. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), such as H2S and CH3SH. We previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and VSCs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and VSCs. In this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the quantitative analysis of VSC-producing bacteria in oral specimens. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the Preventive Dentistry and Breath Odor Clinic of Kyushu Dental College. A real-time PCR assay using the TaqMan system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce VSCs. RESULTS: Using real-time PCR, we performed a quantitative analysis of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, Tan. forsythia, and T. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR using the TaqMan system can be used for the quantitative analysis of VSC-producing oral bacteria.
TI  - Thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) blocks P. gingivalis- and F. nucleatum, but not  E. coli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in adipocytes.
AB  - An elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP) predicts the future development of  coronary heart disease. Periodontitis appears to up-regulate CRP. CRP is produced by hepatocytes in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6). A major source of IL-6 in obese subjects is adipocytes. We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal pathogens stimulated adipocytes to produce IL-6, and that the production was suppressed by the drugs targeted against insulin resistance, thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone), since this agent potentially showed an anti-inflammatory effect. Mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with E. coli, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum LPS. The IL-6 concentration in culture supernatants was measured. All LPS stimulated adipocytes to produce IL-6. Although pioglitazone changed adipocyte appearance from large to small, and completely suppressed P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum LPS-induced IL-6 production, E. coli LPS-induced IL-6 production was not efficiently blocked. Thus, pioglitazone completely blocked periodontal-bacteria-derived LPS-induced IL-6 production in adipocytes, a major inducer of CRP.
TI  - Impact of sample storage on detection of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Information on the impact of sample storage prior to analysis by DNA methods is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subgingival sample storage on bacterial detection and enumeration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were studied by a) checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization by immediate processing, b) storage at + 4 degrees C for 6 weeks, c) storage at - 20 degrees C for 6 months or d) storage at - 20 degrees C for 12 months. RESULTS: No differences in total DNA were found between protocol 1 and 2, or between protocol 3 and 4. Protocol 1 yielded 2.4 times more total bacterial DNA than did protocol 3 (P < 0.001). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Campylobacter gracilis were detected in 21.1% of the immediately processed samples but only in 6.6% of the samples after 12 months of storage. Similar changes were noticed for Treponema denticola, which was detected in 22.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Streptococci spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum and Tannerella forsythia did not seem to be affected by storage. In contrast, the level of Campylobacter rectus detection frequency changed from 2.6% if processed immediately to 15.8% if samples were stored for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In longitudinal clinical studies including microbiological samples and processed with DNA-DNA hybridization methods, samples should be stored for the same period of time before processing to avoid loss of microbiological information.
TI  - Antimicrobial actions of benzimidazoles against oral streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Benzimidazoles, such as lansoprazole and omeprazole, are used extensively as proton-pump inhibitors to control stomach acid secretion and also have antimicrobial actions against Helicobacter pylori. Our objective was to determine whether they are potentially useful antimicrobials against oral bacteria. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans was our main test organism. It was grown in suspension cultures and biofilms. Standard physiologic assays were used to assess inhibitory actions of benzimidazoles. RESULTS: Benzimidazoles inhibited acid production by S. mutans in suspensions or biofilms. In pH-drop experiments, lansoprazole at a level of only 0.025 mm irreversibly inhibited acid production from glycolysis. Cell uptake of lansoprazole was found to be very pH sensitive and occurred mainly at pH values below about 5, indicating that the protonated form was taken up. Lansoprazole inhibition of glycolysis could be blocked by 2-mercaptoethanol, which suggests that disulfide bonds form between benzimidazoles and protein targets. Identified targets for benzimidazole inhibition included the phosphoenolpyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system, the glycolytic enzymes aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactic dehydrogenase, and enzymes such as urease and arginine deiminase. Lansoprazole increased proton permeabilities of S. mutans cells but did not inhibit F-ATPases. Although cells in biofilms were somewhat less sensitive to the agents than those in suspensions, biofilm glycolysis was still markedly inhibited by 0.1 mm lansoprazole. Benzimidazoles are bactericidal, and the oral anaerobes Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia were more sensitive to killing than was S. mutans. CONCLUSION: Benzimidazoles appear to be useful inhibitors of oral bacteria in acid environments such as progressing caries lesions.
TI  - Development and characterization of a simple perfused oral microcosm.
AB  - AIMS: To validate perfused, inline, filter-based fermentation systems (multiple Sorbarod devices, MSD) for their ability to maintain stable oral bacterial communities. MSD enable replicate (n=5) microcosm biofilms (BF) to be established and sampled, together with their perfusates (PA, cells in eluted medium). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fresh saliva from human volunteers was used to inoculate MSD, incubated in an anaerobic cabinet and perfused with artificial saliva at 7 ml h(-1). BF within Sorbarod filters and cells eluted in the PA were analysed at 24-h intervals by differential bacteriological culture and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CKB, 40 oral species). Dynamic stability was apparent after 2-3 days within both BF and PA as evidenced by culture, CKB data and pH measurements. BF harboured large numbers of anaerobic species and facultative anaerobes [ca 10-11 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/filter] comprising considerable numbers of streptococci and Gram-negative species. PA contained ca 9-10 log(10) CFU ml(-1) suggesting an apparent mean growth rate of 0.1 h(-1) for the BF, as a whole corresponding to a mean generation time of 10 h. CKB analysis revealed considerable bacterial diversity within the respective MSD. Inter-individual variations in the relative species abundance of inocula was broadly reproduced in the MSD (BF and PA), although considerable variation was apparent between triplicate models established using saliva from one saliva donor or from three individual donors. The dominance of Gram-negative species, indicated by culture was supported by CKB analysis (major species, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum). CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from the various analytical approaches showed a high degree of congruence. The MSD enables the maintenance of complex, stable salivary microcosms and represents a simple, reproducible tool for modelling individual oral bacterial ecosystems. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the utility of the MSD for studying the micro-ecology of the oral cavity.
TI  - Molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  - Real-time PCR analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. This suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. In this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using DNA extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of Prevotella spp. Using universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene, PCR amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. Phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. Up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. A diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. Other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included Selenomonas spp., Dialister spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium spp., members of the Lachnospiraceae family, Olsenella spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Propionibacterium sp., and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. The mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.
TI  - DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  - Bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. However, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. The aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using DNA-DNA hybridization. Compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. Twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. A multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. Porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. All samples contained Actinomyces, Prevotella and F. nucleatum. The results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.
TI  - Periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (PLBW)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. There is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence PLBW infants. Recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for PLBW. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and PLBW by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. METHODS: Clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum. Subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. In all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. Thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. Statistical methods included Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). Mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than in the cases (p<0.05). The occurrence rates of P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and S. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). According to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, P. micros and C. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of PLBW (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while P. nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, P. micros and C. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for PLBW, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of PLBW. Further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and PLBW.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum increases collagenase 3 production and migration of epithelial cells.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is closely associated with human periodontal diseases and may also be a causative agent in other infections, such as pericarditis, septic arthritis, and abscesses of tonsils and liver. Initiation and outcome of infective diseases depend critically on the host cell signaling system altered by the microbe. Production of proteinases by infected cells is an important factor in pericellular tissue destruction and cell migration. We studied binding of F. nucleatum to human epithelial cells (HaCaT keratinocyte line) and subsequent cell signaling related to collagenase 3 expression, cell motility, and cell survival, using a scratch wound cell culture model. F. nucleatum increased levels of 12 protein kinases involved in cell migration, proliferation, and cell survival signaling, as assessed by the Kinetworks immunoblotting system. Epithelial cells of the artificial wound margins were clearly preferential targets of F. nucleatum. The bacterium colocalized with lysosomal structures and stimulated migration of these cells. Of the 13 anaerobic oral bacterial species, F. nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum were among the best inducers of collagenase 3 mRNA levels, a powerful matrix metalloproteinase. Production of collagenase 3 was detected in fusobacterium-infected cells and cell culture medium by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and zymography. The proteinase production involved activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the infected cells. The study suggests that F. nucleatum may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases (and other infections) by activating multiple cell signaling systems that lead to stimulation of collagenase 3 expression and increased migration and survival of the infected epithelial cells.
TI  - Effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  - According to the US Surgeon General's report, "Oral Health in America," published in 2000, most adults in the United States show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. Periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. New evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. For this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. This article summarizes laboratory research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. This unique combination of agents is found in Colgate Total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. Data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. In addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone resorption. Overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of Colgate Total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in tonsillitis.
AB  - This review summarizes the information that supports the potential importance of  anaerobic bacteria in tonsillitis. Some anaerobic bacteria possess interfering capability with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and other pathogens. The possible role of anaerobes in the acute inflammatory process in the tonsils is supported by several observations: anaerobes have been isolated from the cores of tonsils of patients with recurrent GABHS and non-GABHS tonsillitis (NST); the recovery of anaerobes as predominant pathogens in abscesses of tonsils, in many cases without any aerobic bacteria; their recovery as pathogens in well-established anaerobic infections of the tonsils (Vincent's angina); the increased recovery rate of encapsulated pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in acutely inflamed tonsils; their isolation from the cores of recurrently inflamed NST; and the response to antibiotics in patients with NST. Furthermore, immune response against Prevotella intermedia is present in patients with recurrent NST, and an immune response can also be detected against P. intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum in patients who recovered from peritonsillar cellulitis or abscesses, infectious mononucleosis and acute non-streptococcal and GABHS tonsillitis. Although more studies are needed, these findings support the possible pathogenicity of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli in tonsillitis.
TI  - Phototoxic effect of visible light on Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium  nucleatum: an in vitro study.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of visible light irradiation combined with photosensitizers has been reported. The objective of this was to test the effect of visible light irradiation without photosensitizers on the viability of oral microorganisms. Strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus faecalis in suspension or grown on agar were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400-500 nm. These wavelengths are used to photopolymerize composite resins widely used for dental restoration. Three photocuring light sources, quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp, light-emitting diode and plasma-arc, at power densities between 260 and 1300 mW/cm2 were used for up to 3 min. Bacterial samples were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. The results show that blue light sources exert a phototoxic effect on P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. The minimal inhibitory dose for P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum was 16-62 J/cm2, a value significantly lower than that for S. mutans and S. faecalis (159-212 J/cm2). Near-infrared diode laser irradiation did not affect any of the bacteria tested. Our results suggest that visible light sources without exogenous photosensitizers have a phototoxic effect mainly on Gram-negative periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Attachment of oral gram-negative anaerobic rods to a smooth titanium surface: an  electron microscopy study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Attachment of bacteria to titanium may differ not only between bacterial species but also between strains within a species. The aim of the present in vitro study was to examine differences in bacterial attachment using 4 gram-negative anaerobic species of bacteria that are considered potential periodontal pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The attachment of clinical and laboratory strains (n = 23) representing 2 Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia to smooth, commercially pure titanium was examined using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: All bacterial strains were attached to the smooth titanium surface by their outer membrane. F nucleatum cells were poorly attached to the titanium, unlike P gingivalis or P intermedia cells, but only slight differences were observed in the quantity of attached cells between the strains within each bacterial group. DISCUSSION: In favorable conditions, some anaerobes can attach directly to an inert titanium surface. Microbial adhesion and subsequent colonization on the dental implant surface can lead to infection of the peri-implant tissue. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the avidity of bacterial attachment to a smooth titanium surface varies between species of oral gram-negative anaerobes but not between strains.
TI  - Differential regulation of cytokine genes in gingival epithelial cells challenged by Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - IL-8 mRNA in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) is up-regulated by Fusobacterium nucleatum, and up-/down-regulated by Porphyromonas gingivalis in a complex interaction in the early stages (< or = 4 h) after infection. The mechanisms involved in this regulation in response to F. nucleatum and/or P. gingivalis infection, and identification of co-regulated cytokine genes, are the focus of this investigation. Heat, formalin or protease treatment of F. nucleatum cells attenuated the IL-8 mRNA up-regulation. NF-kappaB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathways were involved in IL-8 mRNA induction by F. nucleatum. Pretreatment of P. gingivalis with heat, formalin or protease enhanced IL-8 mRNA induction. NF-kappaB, MARK p38, and MEK/ERK pathways were also involved in this induction. In contrast, down-regulation of IL-8 mRNA by P. gingivalis involved MEK/ERK, but not NF-kappaB or MAPK p38 pathways. cDNA arrays analysis revealed that mRNA down-regulation by P. gingivalis is a specific reaction that only a number of genes, e.g. IL-1beta, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-2alpha, and migration inhibitory factor-related protein-14, are affected based on examination of 278 cytokine/receptor genes. These data indicate that F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis trigger specific and differential gene regulation pathways in HGECs.
TI  - Genetic determinant of intrinsic quinolone resistance in Fusobacterium canifelinum.
AB  - Fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant fusobacterial strains, originating from cats or dogs, were characterized by sequencing of the 16S-23S and 16S rRNA genes and DNA-DNA hybridization and were described as a new species, Fusobacterium canifelinum. All of the strains are intrinsically resistant (MIC, >4 g/ml) to levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. Compared to the quinolone resistance-determining region (gyrA) of the susceptible relative F. nucleatum, we found that Ser79 was replaced with leucine and Gly83 was replaced with arginine.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - Synergy between Tannerella forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm formation.
AB  - During dental plaque formation, the interaction of different organisms is important in the development of complex communities. Fusobacterium nucleatum is considered a 'bridge-organism' that facilitates colonization of other bacteria by coaggregation-mediated mechanisms and possibly by making the environment conducive for oxygen intolerant anaerobes. These studies were carried out to determine whether coaggregation between F. nucleatum and Tannerella forsythia is important in the formation of mixed species biofilms. Further, the role of BspA protein, a surface adhesin of T. forsythia, in coaggregation and biofilm formation was investigated. The results showed the development of synergistic mixed biofilms of F. nucleatum and T. forsythia when these bacteria were cocultured. The BspA protein was not involved in biofilm formation. Though BspA plays a role in coaggregation with F. nucleatum, presumably other adhesins are also involved. The synergistic biofilm formation between the two species was dependent on cell-cell contact and soluble components of the bacteria were not required. This study demonstrates that there is a positive synergy between F. nucleatum and T. forsythia in the development of mixed biofilms and that the cell-cell interaction is essential for this phenomenon.
TI  - Coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  - Bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. As no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single Candida spp. The quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus bovis II/2 and Gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. Significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella spp.; (2) Actinomyces israelii and Peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) Campylobacter gracilis and Actinomyces spp.; (4) Prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) Fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. The single Candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. Our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. In particular, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.
TI  - The aetiology and treatment of oral halitosis: an update.
AB  - Halitosis refers to the condition of offensive mouth odour. More than 90% of cases of halitosis originate from the oral cavity. The implicated bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythensis) are located in stagnant areas in the oral cavity, such as the dorsal surface of tongue, periodontal pockets, and interproximal areas. These bacteria proteolyse the amino acids releasing volatile sulphur compounds. The management of halitosis involves determining and eliminating the causes, which includes identifying any contributory factors, because certain medical conditions are also associated with characteristic smells. Professional advice should be given on oral hygiene and diet, and treatments should include dental scaling, and root planing of the associated periodontal pockets to reduce the bacterial loading. In addition to the normal oral hygiene practice, tongue cleaning and use of mouthwash are advocated. This paper discusses the common aetiological factors, classification of oral halitosis, and its treatment.
TI  - Periimplantitis.
AB  - Orodental rehabilitation through the use of implants offers very high success rates. In this paper, we describe some of the complications involved with this technique, such as periimplant disease and, within this category, periimplantitis, an inflammatory reaction in which there is a loss of the bony support of the implant accompanied by inflammation. The aetiology of the disease is conditioned by the status of the tissue surrounding the implant, implant design, degree of roughness, the poor alignment of implant components, external morphology and excessive mechanical load. The microorganisms most commonly associated with implant failure are spirochetes and mobile forms of Gram-negative anaerobes, unless the origin is the result of simple mechanical overload. Diagnosis is based on changes of colour in the gum, bleeding and probing depth of periimplant pockets, suppuration, x-ray and gradual loss of bone height around the tooth. Treatment will differ depending upon whether it is a case of mucositis or periimplantitis. Therapeutic objectives focus on correcting technical defects by means of surgery and decontamination techniques (abrasion with carbon particles, citric acid solution, topical tetracycline application and laser surgery). This study also presents a microbiological study of periimplantitis conducted by the Barcelona School of Dentistry that determined that the antibiotic therapy proven to be most efficacious in the antibiogram was the association of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid.
TI  - Characterization of the novel Fusobacterium nucleatum plasmid pKH9 and evidence of an addiction system.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is an important oral anaerobic pathogen involved in periodontal and systemic infections. Studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in fusobacterial virulence and adhesion have been limited by lack of systems for efficient genetic manipulation. Plasmids were isolated from eight strains of F. nucleatum. The smallest plasmid, pKH9 (4,975 bp), was characterized and used to create new vectors for fusobacterial genetic manipulation. DNA sequence analysis of pKH9 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative autonomous rolling circle replication protein (Rep), an ORF predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of the FtsK/SpoIIIE cell division-DNA segregation protein family, and an operon encoding a putative toxin-antitoxin plasmid addiction system (txf-axf). Deletion analysis localized the pKH9 replication region in a 0.96-kbp fragment. The pKH9 rep gene is not present in this fragment, suggesting that pKH9 can replicate in fusobacteria independently of the Rep protein. A pKH9-based, compact Escherichia coli-F. nucleatum shuttle plasmid was constructed and found to be compatible with a previously described pFN1-based fusobacterial shuttle plasmid. Deletion of the pKH9 putative addiction system (txf-axf) reduced plasmid stability in fusobacteria, indicating its addiction properties and suggesting it to be the first plasmid addiction system described for fusobacteria. pKH9, its genetic elements, and its shuttle plasmid derivatives can serve as useful tools for investigating fusobacterial properties important in biofilm ecology and pathogenesis.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships of Fusobacterium nucleatum based on phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phylogenetic position and evolutionary relationships of Fusobacteria remain uncertain. Especially intriguing is their relatedness to low G+C Gram positive bacteria (Firmicutes) by ribosomal molecular phylogenies, but their possession of a typical gram negative outer membrane. Taking advantage of the recent completion of the Fusobacterium nucleatum genome sequence we have examined the evolutionary relationships of Fusobacterium genes by phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics tools. RESULTS: The data indicate that Fusobacterium has a core genome of a very different nature to other bacterial lineages, and branches out at the base of Firmicutes. However, depending on the method used, 35-56% of Fusobacterium genes appear to have a xenologous origin from bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, spirochaetes and the Firmicutes themselves. A high number of hypothetical ORFs with unusual codon usage and short lengths were found and hypothesized to be remnants of transferred genes that were discarded. Some proteins and operons are also hypothesized to be of mixed ancestry. A large portion of the Gram-negative cell wall-related genes seems to have been transferred from proteobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Many instances of similarity to other inhabitants of the dental plaque that have been sequenced were found. This suggests that the close physical contact found in this environment might facilitate horizontal gene transfer, supporting the idea of niche-specific gene pools. We hypothesize that at a point in time, probably associated to the rise of mammals, a strong selective pressure might have existed for a cell with a Clostridia-like metabolic apparatus but with the adhesive and immune camouflage features of Proteobacteria.
TI  - Killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (PDT). METHODS: In this study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, BLC 1010, and BLC 1014 by three different methods for their effect in PDT on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. The methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (CFU), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. RESULTS: Using the CFU method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 J/cm2 in the presence of 10 microM chlorin e6 and 10 microM BLC 1010. With the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and BLC 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. BLC 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. The results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer BLC 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. CONCLUSION: The data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and BLC 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - ["In vitro" activity of ten antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. A collaborative study, 1999-2002].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, and azitromycin was assesed against 166 strains of anaerobic bacteria recovered from eight hospitals in Buenos Aires. The strains studied were Bacteroides fragilis group (65), Fusobacterium spp. (26), Prevotella spp. (21), Porphyromonas spp. (10), Clostridium difficile (10), other clostridia (12), and gram-positive cocci (22). The MICs were determined by the agar dilution method according to NCCLS document M11-A5. Metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active antimicrobial agents tested and exhibited MIC90 values of < or = 2 microg/ml and < or = 4 microg/ml against gram-negative organisms, and < or = 2 microg/ml, and < or = 8 microg/ml against gram-positive organisms, respectively. Among beta-lactams the activity against gram-negative rods was in the following order: imipenem > piperacillin > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. Among the gram-positive bacteria the decreased activity was: piperacillin > imipenem > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. The majority of the species studied showed different degrees of resistance to clindamycin and azitromycin. Nevertheless, 90% of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas spp. isolates were inhibited by 0.125 mg/ml of clindamycin and azitromycin, respectively.
TI  - [An unusual case of hepatic abscess].
AB  - Right upper quadrant pain with chronic malaise and fever can be the clinical manifestation of a hepatic infection. An uncommon cause for the disease is hepatic actinomycosis. Actinomycosis was common in the preantibiotic era but is less frequent nowadays; consequently its timely recognition has become more difficult. The clinical and radiological findings often resemble other inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. We report a case of a mixed anaerobic liver abscess including fusobacteria and actinomycetes, without apparent predisposing factor. The diagnosis was obtained by CT-guided percutaneous aspiration of the hepatic mass, where microscopy revealed the presence of fusiform gramnegative bacteria and gram-positive branching filamentous rods consistent with Actinomyces species. The latter did not grow in culture, while the gram negatives were identified as fusobacterium nucleatum. The diagnosis of actinomycosis of the liver is confirmed in only a minority of cases by culture. The disease is usually treated with an extended course of antibiotics. Penicillin is the preferred choice.
TI  - Investigation of the effect of the coronal restoration quality on the composition of the root canal microflora in teeth with apical periodontitis by means of T-RFLP analysis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of the radiographic and clinical quality of coronal restorations on the composition of the root canal flora of teeth with necrotic pulps and teeth with root fillings associated with apical periodontitis. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-eight necrotic pulps and 35 root filled canals with signs of apical periodontitis were studied. Both the coronal filling (presence of radiographically or clinically deficient margins and/or secondary caries) and the root filling (homogeneity and length) were scored. Bacterial root canal samples were taken with sterile paper points under rubber dam and using measures to prevent contamination. A DNA-based nonculture bacterial identification technique was used, namely terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: Twelve samples were negative for bacterial DNA. A total of 33 different terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) were detected. The Fusobacterium nucleatum/Streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently encountered TRF. The mean number of TRFs per necrotic pulp was 6.2 and 5.8 for the groups with acceptable and unacceptable coronal restorations, respectively. This difference was not significant. In the root filled group, these values (respectively, 5.2 and 8.6) were statistically significantly different (P < 0.05). The following parameters in root filled teeth had no significant influence on the mean numbers of TRFs detected: the length and homogeneity of the root filling and the type of tooth (anterior-premolar-molar). CONCLUSION: T-RFLP allowed the rapid assessment of bacterial biodiversity in root canal samples. The technique revealed the presence of bacteria that have rarely been described in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis. Biodiversity in the root filled group was high, as compared with culture-dependent studies where monoinfections were more frequently reported. Only in root filled teeth did defective coronal restorations have a statistically significant influence on the mean numbers of detected TRFs per sample.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium varium and Fusobacterium nucleatum based on gyrB gene sequences.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the DNA gyrase B subunit gene (gyrB) of Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme and F. varium were determined and analyzed together with those of F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii. On the phylogenetic tree constructed, the strains of each fusobacterial species formed distinct clusters with deep sublines. The degree of sequence similarity within each cluster was 93.2% or more, whereas similarities between clusters ranged from 70.1 to 72.7%. These clusters were recovered with 100% bootstrap probabilities and are in very good agreement with the species of Fusobacterium. These data suggest that gyrB is an accurate genealogical marker for the classification of the fusobacterial taxa considered in this study.
TI  - Rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. Bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. The isolates were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), Eikenella corrodens (13.2%), Prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), Prevotella disiens (3.1%), Peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), Prevotella corporis (1.8%), Peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). No periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). The number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. It is concluded that the bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Antiproliferative activity of Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans  and Fusobacterium nucleatum in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - Several studies indicate Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum as etiologic agents of periodontal disease. Immunosuppressive factors produced by microorganisms probably contribute to the initiation and evolution of this disease. This study evaluated the antiproliferative activity of ammonium precipitate fractions of A. (H.) actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum isolates from humans and marmosets both with and without periodontal disease. All A. (H.) actinomycetemcomitans and most F. nucleatum strains inhibited PBMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The degree of cell proliferative inhibition of each bacterial species differed among the strains and was independent of host clinical status. The in vitro inhibition of stimulated lymphocyte proliferation induced by different A. (H.) actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum isolates demonstrated the importance of this phenomenon in bacterial virulence, playing a possible suppressor role in host defense mechanisms in vivo. Moreover, our findings pointed out a marked difference between A. (H.) actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum cytoplasmic extracts in their antiproliferative activity, regarding the antigen concentration required for maximum inhibition and their vulnerability to heating and proteolytic treatment.
TI  - Detection of pathogens from periodontal lesions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To comparatively detect A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum from periodontal and healthy sites. METHODS: Subgingival clinical samples from 50 periodontitis adult patients and 50 healthy subjects were analyzed. Both organisms were isolated using a trypticase soy agar-bacitracin-vancomycin (TSBV) medium and detected by PCR. Conventional biochemical tests were used for bacteria identification. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum were isolated in 18% and 20% of the patients, respectively, and in 2% and 24% of healthy subjects. Among A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates, biotype II was the most prevalent. Primer pair AA was 100% sensitive in the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans from both subject groups. Primers ASH and FU were also 100% sensitive to detect this organism in healthy subject samples. Primer pair FN5047 was more sensitive to detect F. nucleatum in patients or in healthy samples than primer 5059S. Primers ASH and 5059S were more specific in the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, respectively, in patients and in healthy subject samples. CONCLUSIONS: PCR is an effective tool for detecting periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples, providing a faster and safer diagnostic tool of periodontal diseases. The method's sensitivity and specificity is conditioned by the choice of the set of primers used.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of endodontic files after cleaning and steam sterilization procedures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection control procedures are essential for modern dental practice and they are continually evolving to meet the dental profession's high standards. The present study evaluated the efficacy of two cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers on endodontic files, and evaluated the effect of biological debris on the subsequent sterilization of files. METHODS: Stainless steel and nickel-titanium (NiTi) files were examined upon removal from the manufacturer's packaging, after instrumentation in root canals of human teeth inoculated with a broth containing two anaerobic species and one facultative anaerobic species of bacteria, and after instrumentation and cleaning with either an ultrasonic bath or a thermal disinfector. For each file, the bacterial numbers were quantified using routine microbiological techniques in an anaerobic chamber. RESULTS: No bacteria were detected from files direct from their packets. The size, taper and type of file did not affect the ability of either of the cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers. However, an absence of bacteria was more likely when files were cleaned in the thermal disinfector. No bacteria were detected from files that were-subjected to steam sterilization irrespective of the type of prior cleaning procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Steam sterilization eliminated all bacteria from the endodontic files irrespective of the presence of biological debris. The majority of bacteria were eliminated from endodontic files after either ultrasonic cleaning or using a thermal disinfector.
TI  - Alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. Bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (BHI-blood agar), adjusted to pH 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic glove box. Bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched BHI broth adjusted to pH 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16S rDNA sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. In the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. Bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard BHI-blood agars (pH 7.0) were used. Of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at pH 9.0 and 4 at pH 10.0. The alkali-resistant strains included Enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), Enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), Klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), Streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and Streptococcus mitis (2 strains). Three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus Firmicutes or Staphylococcus at the genus level. The present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at pH 9.0 and/or pH 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus Enterococcus.
TI  - Periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. A controlled clinical and laboratory trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A possible relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease has been suggested. The aims of this controlled clinical study were: (i) to ascertain the presence of periodontal bacteria DNA [Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus)] in carotid atheromatous plaques and (ii) to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria DNA, if any, in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheroma in the same patient. METHODS: A total of 52 patients scheduled for carotid endarderectomy were enrolled in this study. The test group consisted of 26 dentate patients; the control group included 26 edentulous patients. A complete periodontal examination, including radiographic orthopanoramic and subgingival plaque sample, was performed in the test population. Oral and X-ray examinations were performed in the control group. Atheromatous plaques were harvested during surgical procedure for each dentate and edentulous patient and then sent to the microbiological laboratory. Subgingival plaque samples and carotid specimens were examined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique by means of specific primers for periodontal bacteria. Amplification of extracted DNA was tested using human beta-globin specific-primers. RESULTS: Out of 52 endarterectomy samples, 12 (seven dentate, five edentulous patients) were excluded as negative to DNA amplification. In subgingival plaque samples of 19 test patients, T. forsythensis (79%), F. nucleatum (63%), P. intermedia (53%), P. gingivalis (37%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (5%) were found. No periodontal bacteria DNA was detected by PCR in any of the carotid samples in either patient group. CONCLUSION: The presence of periodontal bacteria DNA in atheromatous plaques could not be confirmed by this study and thus no correlation could be established between species associated with periodontal disease and putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques.
TI  - Cavernous sinus thrombosis and cerebral infarction caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum infection.
AB  - We report an unusual case of fusobacterial infection with secondary intracranial  invasion. The condition was complicated by a cavernous sinus thrombosis and ischemic stroke. The patient was a 63-year-old woman with no history of systemic disease who had undergone a tooth extraction before the onset of symptoms. She initially suffered from sphenomaxillary sinusitis and a cavernous sinus thrombosis, and subsequently developed meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid examination suggested a pyogenic infection. Anaerobic culture revealed Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, despite immediate antibiotic therapy, her condition remained unstable over the next few days, and she eventually developed an ischemic stroke. We describe our experience in the management of this case of anaerobic meningitis and the unusual complication of ischemic stroke; this case suggests that more aggressive therapy in addition to empirical antibiotics may be warranted.
TI  - Binding of pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9 by Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum as a mechanism to promote the invasion of a reconstituted basement membrane.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the ability of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum to increase its tissue-invasive potential by acquiring cell-associated human matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity. Binding of pro-MMP-9 to fusobacteria was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Zymography and a colorimetric assay showed that bound pro-MMP-9 can be converted into a proteolytically active form. The potential contribution of this acquired host activity in tissue invasion was demonstrated using a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel).
TI  - In situ biofilm formation by multi-species oral bacteria under flowing and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - An understanding of biofilm behavior of periodontopathic bacteria is key to the development of effective oral therapies. We hypothesized that interspecies bacterial aggregates play an important role in anaerobic biofilm establishment and proliferation, and contribute to the survivability of the biofilm against therapeutic agents. The system developed in this study assessed a multi-species (Streptococcus gordonii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) biofilm formation under anaerobic and flowing conditions with the use of an in situ image analysis system. The biofilm was comprised of a base film of non-aggregated cells and complex interspecies aggregates that formed in the planktonic phase which rapidly colonized the surface, reaching 58 +/- 9% and 65 +/- 11.8% coverage by 5 and 24 hrs, respectively. Upon SDS (0.1%) treatment of a 24-hour biofilm, substantial detachment (55 +/- 14%, P < 0.05) of the aggregates was observed, while the base film bacteria remained attached but non-viable. Rapid re-establishment of the biofilm occurred via attachment of viable planktonic aggregates.
TI  - Dehydration of (R)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA to enoyl-CoA in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (R)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which is dehydrated to enoyl-CoA by syn-elimination. This reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pK 40-50). A mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. The 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component A, an activator, and component D, the actual dehydratase. Component A, a homodimer with one [4Fe-4S]cluster, transfers an electron to component D, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe-4S]clusters and FMN, concomitant with hydrolysis of two ATP. From component D the electron is further transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. In the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pK14). After elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of ATP. The helix-cluster-helix architecture of component A forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of ATP resembling an archer shooting arrows. Therefore we designated component A as 'Archerase'. Here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans, Clostridium symbiosum and Fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium difficile, and lactyl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium propionicum. A relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases is benzoyl-CoA reductase from Thauera aromatica. Analogous but unrelated archerases are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. In anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven electron transfer from NADH to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component A, has been established. The transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical Na(+)-gradient. This enzyme is related to the Rnf proteins involved in Rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.
TI  - Mesenteric adenitis and portal vein thrombosis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - We report the first description of portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis associated with suppurative mesenteric adenitis in a 71-year-old woman. The bacterium detected in mesenteric lymph nodes was Fusobacterium nucleatum, an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus. Our patient had a clinical syndrome of pharyngitis and fever preceding portal vein thrombosis. Abdominal symptoms improved with antibiotics and anticoagulant therapy. This location of F. nucleatum in mesenteric lymph nodes provides an interesting insight into the occurrence of septic thrombosis in the portal vein following pharyngo-tonsillar infection.
TI  - Fusobacterium canifelinum sp. nov., from the oral cavity of cats and dogs.
AB  - Fourteen strains of Gram-negative, anaerobic, fluoroquinolone-resistant, non-sporulating rods were isolated from various infections in cats and dogs, as well as from wounds in humans after cat- or dog-bites. These strains were characterized by sequencing of the 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, 16S rDNA, DNA-DNA hybridization, phylogenetic analysis, and phenotypic tests. The results indicate that the novel strains belong to a distinct species, closely related to Fusobacterium nucleatum. The species Fusobacterium canifelinum sp. nov. is proposed, with strain ATCC BAA 689T as the type strain.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. METHOD: Fourteen subjects were identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (SRP), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. After baseline monitoring, subjects received SRP, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. Subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. Significance of changes in clinical and microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the Friedman or Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: On average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. Mean (+/-SEM) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. Clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. Reductions occurred for three Actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including Campylobacter showae, Eubacterium nodatum, three Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia as well as the "Streptococcus milleri" group, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedus. Subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.
TI  - Selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  - Bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. The apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. The results showed that Pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), Treponema denticola in 6 (26%), Fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), Porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), Filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), Dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), Porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and Tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%). No sample yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, or Campylobacter rectus. Of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. Occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  - This study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the USA. beta-Lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition, the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. The most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus Prevotella. Other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp. Facultative bacteria, such as Burkholderia spp., Ralstonia pickettii, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin and amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the Prevotella species. All Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. Two of the Prevotella isolates had high MICs of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. ESBL activity was not detected in any of the beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the Etest method. Thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a role in refractory periodontal disease.
TI  - The participation of nitric oxide in peritoneal exudate cell cytotoxicity of mice by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Previously we reported that mice infected recurrently with live Fusobacterium nucleatum(Fn) synthesize a significant amount of NO between 12 hr and 24 hr after Fn injection. Fn is a gram-negative rod periodontal pathogen. NO could not be induced by heat-killed Fn or in untreated mice. This NO, derived from the iNOS after infection of live Fn, was not involved in the Fn reduction because Fn clearance occurs within 6 hr. We investigated in this study whether this NO was involved in cytotoxicity in peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) in vivo. The mice were divided into two groups: those treated with live Fn (immune) and those left untreated (normal). PEC number, NO production, detection of apoptosis or death cells, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release activity after injection of live Fn were compared in these groups. In the immune group, the increase of the total cell numbers caused by an increase in neutrophils, a significant NO production only after injection of live Fn at 24 hr and identification of iNOS positive macrophages were confirmed. The apoptotic rate was very low and did not increase at 24 hr in vivo. Therefore, apoptosis was seldom relevant to the NO. In the immune group, LDH activity was remarkable high at 24 hr, and dead cells and macrophages phagocytizing cell fragments increased at the same time. Pretreatment of L NMMA, an inhibitor of iNOS, suppressed LDH activity and cell death. Therefore, the NO derived from the iNOS is involved in the cytotoxicity. These results suggest that NO may contribute to the inflammatory response during Fn infection in periodontitis.
TI  - Identification and sequencing of bacterial rDNAs in culture-negative amniotic fluid from women in premature labor.
AB  - Our objective was to identify bacterial species present in culture-negative but 16S rDNA-positive amniotic fluid samples from women in preterm labor. Amniotic fluid from 69 women in preterm labor was cultured and examined for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect highly conserved bacterial ribosomal DNA sequences (16S rDNAs). As previously reported, 16S rDNAs were identified in 15 (94%) of 16 culture-positive amniotic fluid samples, in 5 (36%) of 14 culture-negative samples with elevated IL-6, and in 1 (3%) of 39 culture-negative samples with low IL-6 levels. Direct sequencing was performed of 16S rDNAs from the 5 culture-negative amniotic fluid specimens with elevated IL-6, followed by database searches and phylogenetic analyses. The bacterial sequences identified included: two Leptotrichia sanguinegens, one human oral bacterium A33, one Fusobacterium nucleatum, and one Ureaplasma urealyticum. Identification and sequencing of 16S rDNAs in amniotic fluid is a promising technique to identify bacterial species associated with elevated IL-6 levels in culture-negative amniotic fluid that may contribute to the etiology of premature labor.
TI  - Implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. Placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. The 10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. Six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. METHODS: Oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. The distance implant bone (DIB) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. The levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using DNA probe technology. Additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. RESULTS: The peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, and Treponema denticola were not detected. Low levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens were found. Prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). The mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.
TI  - [Purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus sanguis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus sanguis plays an important Role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. Previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by S. sanguis has a prominent function of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (PPB). The aim of this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. METHODS: The raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of S. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. Then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. The characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on PPB was measured by agar diffusion test. RESULTS: The purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by SDS-PAGE, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). The purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our methods are useful for the purification of sanguicin. Sanguicin has inhibitory effect on PPB obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.
TI  - Active domains of salivary statherin on apatitic surfaces for binding to Fusobacterium nucleatum cells.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum can bind to saliva-coated tooth surfaces. However, the nature of the domains of salivary protein that interact with F. nucleatum remains unclear. The ability of individual proteins in human submandibular-sublingual saliva (HSMSL) to bind F. nucleatum cells was examined by dot blot assay; statherin displayed the strongest binding activity. Statherin binding sites were determined based on binding of (125)I-labelled F. nucleatum to statherin-coated hydroxyapatite (sHAP) beads via inhibition assays using synthetic analogous peptide fragments of whole statherin. Analogous peptides corresponding to residues 19-26 and 32-39 of statherin inhibited binding by 77 % and 68 %, respectively. Synthetic peptides were also prepared by serial deletions of individual residues from N- and C-termini of the peptides GPYQPVPE (aa 19-26) and QPYQPQYQ (aa 32-39). The inhibitory effects of peptides YQPVPE (aa 21-26) and PYQPQYQ (aa 33-39) were very similar to those of GPYQPVPE and QPYQPQYQ, respectively. However, additional deletion of residues resulted in significant reduction of the inhibitory effect. Alanine-scan analysis of YQPVPE revealed that all tested peptides retained inhibitory activity; only YAPVPE exhibited significantly decreased inhibitory activity. These findings suggest that YQPVPE and PYQPQYQ may represent the minimal active segments of statherin for binding to F. nucleatum; moreover, Gln may be a key amino acid in the active segment.
TI  - Development of a multispecies oral bacterial community in a saliva-conditioned flow cell.
AB  - Microbial communities within the human oral cavity are dynamic associations of more than 500 bacterial species that form biofilms on the soft and hard tissues of the mouth. Understanding the development and spatial organization of oral biofilms has been facilitated by the use of in vitro models. We used a saliva-conditioned flow cell, with saliva as the sole nutritional source, as a model to examine the development of multispecies biofilm communities from an inoculum containing the coaggregation partners Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella atypica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Biofilms inoculated with individual species in a sequential order were compared with biofilms inoculated with coaggregates of the four species. Our results indicated that flow cells inoculated sequentially produced biofilms with larger biovolumes compared to those biofilms inoculated with coaggregates. Individual-species biovolumes within the four-species communities also differed between the two modes of inoculation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with genus- and species-specific probes revealed that the majority of cells in both sequentially and coaggregate-inoculated biofilms were S. gordonii, regardless of the inoculation order. However, the representation of A. naeslundii and V. atypica was significantly higher in biofilms inoculated with coaggregates compared to sequentially inoculated biofilms. Thus, these results indicate that the development of multispecies biofilm communities is influenced by coaggregations preformed in planktonic phase. Coaggregating bacteria such as certain streptococci are especially adapted to primary colonization of saliva-conditioned surfaces independent of the mode of inoculation and order of addition in the multispecies inoculum. Preformed coaggregations favor other bacterial strains and may facilitate symbiotic relationships.
TI  - Portal vein thrombosis associated with Fusobacterium nucleatum septicemia in a patient with ulcerative colitis.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of the whole genome DNA-DNA hybridization technique to identify bacteria in histological sections of periradicular lesions.
AB  - Whole genome DNA-DNA hybridization has been used to identify bacteria in periradicular lesions partly because there is no amplification of the bacteria, therefore, minor contaminants are not detected. There are, however, potential pitfalls with this technique, including inability to distinguish dead bacteria, cross-reactions of species within a genus, and inability to detect species present in low numbers because of loss of DNA during extraction and purification. Alternatively, inadequate extraction and purification of DNA could result in false positives. Therefore, controls are required to monitor DNA loss, DNA cross-reactions, and DNA of pure cultures mixed with bacteria-free tissue to monitor for false positives. We determined that the quality of DNA extracted from histological sections of periradicular lesions is excellent for DNA-DNA hybridization. Although lesions contain large numbers of bacteria, histological sections through lesions barely contain sufficient quantity of bacteria for such analysis. This was confirmed by histological observation of sparsely distributed bacteria within lesions. Furthermore, we found that the bacteria are not distributed evenly throughout periradicular lesions, in numbers or species.
TI  - Comparison of systemic flurithromycin therapy and clinical procedures in the treatment of periodontal diseases.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate, in 20 periodontal patients, the microbial and clinical effects of flurithromycin therapy plus scaling and root planning (SRP) in comparison with SRP alone. Clinical assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing and pocket depth were made prior to SRP alone and SRP plus flurithromycin therapy (375 mg twice daily for 5 days) and after both treatments. Subgingival plaque samples (n. 180) were taken prior to and after both treatments and analyzed by conventional bacteriological procedures. Differences in pocket depth and prevalence of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapies using statistical analyses. A significant decrease (p<0.001) was seen for pocket depth post SRP alone and post SRP plus flurithromycin. After two treatments, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Prevotella melaninogenica were eradicated from all tested sites. If we compare the prevalence of the species isolated after SRP alone and after SRP plus flurithromycin statistically significant differences were detected for P. gingivalis and for Fusobacterium nucleatum (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Flurithromycin can be considered a useful adjunct to mechanical periodontal treatment since it is more efficient in eliminating periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. A study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in Chileans residing in Santiago. METHODS: Twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (PD) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (AL) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a history of periodontal therapy were selected. Measurements of PD, AL, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The microbial data of the Chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from Boston, Massachusetts. Since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean PD, gender, and smoking status. RESULTS: Each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. With the exception of Prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), and Treponema denticola as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Campylobacter rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Treponerma socranskii. Sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between Chilean and U.S. subjects. Red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the Chileans, while the Actinomyces were higher in the U.S. subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. Thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.
TI  - Effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  - The aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. A total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x 46.4 +/- 1.71). Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Bleeding on Probing (BP), Probing Depth (PD), and Attachment Level (AL) were measured. Subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (Pi/n), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). The patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. After 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. The sites were divided according to baseline PD values into: Group 1 (5 mm), Group 2 (6 mm) and Group 3 (> or = 7 mm). Results revealed a significant reduction in PI scores, GI scores, PB and PD in groups 2 and 3. No significant difference in AL was observed in any of the three groups. PI scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and GI scores, BP and PD tended to decrease. A significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. Group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. At the end of the study, a significant decrease in Pi/n was found in all three groups. Significant decreases were found in Pg and Fn in Groups 3 and 2 respectively. Although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.
TI  - Modulation of the antibody response by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in a mouse model.
AB  - Successive immunization of mice with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to modulate the specific serum IgG responses to these organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate these antibody responses further by examining the IgG subclasses induced as well as the opsonizing properties of the specific antibodies. Serum samples from BALB/c mice immunized with F. nucleatum (gp1-F), P. gingivalis (gp2-P), P. gingivalis followed by F. nucleatum (gp3-PF) F. nucleatum followed by P. gingivalis (gp4-FP) or saline alone (gp5-S) were examined for specific IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) antibody levels using an ELISA and the opsonizing properties measured using a neutrophil chemiluminescence assay. While IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses were induced in all immunized groups, there was a tendency towards an IgG1 response in mice immunized with P. gingivalis alone, while immunization with F. nucleatum followed by P. gingivalis induced significantly higher anti-P. gingivalis IgG2a levels than IgG1. The maximum light output due to neutrophil phagocytosis of P. gingivalis occurred at 10 min using nonopsonized bacteria. Chemiluminescence was reduced using serum-opsonized P. gingivalis and, in particular, sera from P. gingivalis-immunized mice (gp2-P), with maximum responses occurring at 40 min. In contrast, phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized F. nucleatum demonstrated peak light output at 10 min, while that of F. nucleatum opsonized with sera from saline injected mice (gp5-S) and control nonopsonized bacteria showed peak responses at 40 min. The lowest phagocytic response occurred using gp4-FP serum-opsonized F. nucleatum. In conclusion, the results of the present study have demonstrated a systemic Th1/Th2 response in mice immunized with P. gingivalis and/or F. nucleatum with a trend towards a Th2 response in P. gingivalis-immunized mice and a significantly increased anti-P. gingivalis IgG2a (Th1) response in mice immunized with F. nucleatum prior to P. gingivalis. Further, the inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized P. gingivalis was modulated by the presence of anti-F. nucleatum antibodies, while anti-P. gingivalis antibodies induced an inhibitory effect on the phagocytic response to F. nucleatum.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Perforation repair comparing two types of mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of two types of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) to seal furcal perforations in extracted human molars using an anaerobic bacterial leakage model. Forty, human, maxillary and mandibular molars were randomly divided into two experimental groups of 18, with two teeth used as positive controls and two teeth without perforations used as negative controls. Experimental group 1 was repaired with gray-colored MTA and group 2 with off-white-colored MTA. A dual-chamber, anaerobic, bacterial-leakage model was assembled. Brain-heart infusion broth with yeast extract, hemin, and menadione was used as the culture broth for Fusobacterium nucleatum. Two of 18 gray-colored MTA samples leaked and three off-white-colored MTA samples leaked. There was no significant difference between the two types of MTA in preventing leakage of F. nucleatum past furcal perforation repairs.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Clonal persistence of oral Fusobacterium nucleatum in infancy.
AB  - Once established, early-colonizing bacterial species tend to persist in the mouth. To obtain detailed information on the population dynamics of early-colonizing oral anaerobes, we examined the clonal diversity and persistence of clones among oral Fusobacterium nucleatum populations during the first 2 yrs of life. Consecutive salivary samples from 12 infants, collected at 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mos of age, yielded a total of 546 F. nucleatum isolates for clonal typing with arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Up to 7 AP-PCR types were simultaneously detected in each sample. In 11 out of the 12 infants examined, AP-PCR types persisted for up to 1 yr. Strain turnover rate was high during the first year of life, but then the occurrence of persistent clones increased. This study indicates a wide genetic diversity within the species and provides evidence for the increasing persistence of F. nucleatum clones in the oral cavity with age.

TI  - Surveillance of susceptibility patterns in 1297 European and US anaerobic and capnophilic isolates to co-amoxiclav and five other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in Europe and the USA. The co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) MIC(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms of amoxicillin concentration in mg/L) were 0.5/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for Prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for Eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for Fingoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for Porphyromonas species. The co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for B. fragilis was 94.6%, for P. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. These data indicate that co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. Among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except E. corrodens (MIC(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/L), which is a capnophilic organism. Imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). Levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against Bacteroides, Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 72.7%, Prevotella 71.5%, F. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 79.5%, Prevotella 92.1%, F. magna 84.7%).
TI  - The role of lipopolysaccharide in infectious bone resorption of periapical lesion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in periapical lesion-induced bone resorption was investigated. Polymyxin B (PMB), a specific inhibitor of LPS, was evaluated to treat the apical lesion. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide isolated from two common endodontic pathogens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas endodontalis, stimulated mouse macrophage (J774) to release interleukin-1alpha (IL-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in a time-dependent manner. RESULTS: Combination of LPS further enhanced the stimulation. PMB inhibited these effects significantly. LPS also stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) gene expression in J774, whereas anti-IL-1 alpha and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, as well as PMB, diminished this effect. A disease model of periapical lesion was established in Wistar rat. Administration of PMB reduced the extent of lesion-associated bone resorption by 76% to approximately 80%, and simultaneously reduced the numbers of MMP-1-producing macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that LPS released from the infected root canal triggers the synthesis of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha from macrophages. These pro-inflammatory cytokines up-regulate the production of MMP-1 by macrophages to promote periapical bone resorption.
TI  - Microbiologic diagnostics at titanium implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiota found at periimplant lesions have been shown to contain putative periodontal pathogens as well as opportunistic species such as Staphylococcus spp, enterics, and Candida spp. Therefore, a microbiologic diagnosis may be of value as guidance before treatment of such lesions. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of some putative pathogens associated with long-term followed-up cases using two different microbiologic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen subjects contributed with plaque samples from teeth and implants; these were analyzed with respect to 18 putative periimplant pathogens using cultural methods and a deoxyribonucleic acid DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The number of individuals positive for the analyzed pathogens was similar in samples taken from teeth and implants when analyzed with the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. When comparing detection frequency by culture procedure and by "checkerboard" technique at implants, the number of individuals positive for these species was lower with the traditional culture technique than with the checkerboard analyses. Using a higher cutoff point (> or = 4) with the checkerboard technique, the number of positive individuals was generally lower than that found with the culture technique. When comparing the techniques on an implant site level, the prevalence obtained by culture was lower for all analyzed species. If the specific species were present in the samples analyzed by the checkerboard technique, they were present only in every second sample analyzed with the culture technique. The high specificity values showed that if the checkerboard technique did not detect any Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or Fusobacterium nucleatum, the bacteria were also undetectable by the culture technique. The two methods therefore did not overlap but did supplement each other. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current results it is recommended that the technique used when analyzing microbiota around titanium implants should be a combination of the two protocols mentioned as they seem to give the most comprehensive outcome when used together.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Induction of calprotectin release by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  - Calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. This protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory gingival tissue with periodontal disease. Recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. However, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. Neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P-LPS), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli. Calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by ELISA. Two subunits (10 and 14 kDa) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. P-LPS increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). Lipopolysaccharides from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. These results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.
TI  - Identification of a Fusobacterium nucleatum 65 kDa serine protease.
AB  - A 65 kDa protease was partially purified from extracellular vesicles of Fusobacterium nucleatum cultures by preparative SDS-PAGE followed by electroelution. The pH optimum of the protease is 7.5-8.0 and its activity could be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. The protease was found to degrade the extracellular matrix proteins fibrinogen and fibronectin as well as collagen I and collagen IV which were degraded at 37 degrees C but not at 28 degrees C, indicating the presence of a gelatinase activity in these bacteria. The 65 kDa protease was also able to digest the alpha-chains of immunoglobulin A but not immunoglobulin G. The 65 kDa F. nucleatum protease, capable of degrading native proteins, may play an important role in both the nutrition and pathogenicity of these periodontal microorganisms. The degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by bacterial enzymes may contribute to the damage of periodontal tissues, and degradation of IgA may help the evasion of the immune system of the host by the bacteria.
TI  - Risk factors for periodontitis in HIV patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for periodontitis associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: A total of 152 HIV(+) patients were recruited from the CARE clinic at the University of the Pacific School of Dentistry. Clinical measurements (gingival index, plaque index, bleeding index, probing depth, and attachment loss), gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival plaque samples were taken from eight sites of each patient at baseline and 6-month visits. GCF neutrophil elastase was determined by measurement of p-nitroanalide resulting from hydrolysis of an elastase-specific peptide. GCF beta-glucuronidase was determined by release of 4-methylumbelliferone from hydrolysis of a specific substrate. A bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay was used to detect periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples. RESULTS: Viral load, age, smoking pack-years, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, neutrophil elastase, and beta-glucuronidase were significantly correlated with clinical measurements (0.0001 < p < 0.05). Significantly higher levels of elastase, beta-glucuronidase, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were found at progressing sites than in non-progressing sites (0.001 < p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that age, smoking pack-years, viral load, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, elastase, and beta-glucuronidase are risk factors for periodontitis in HIV(+) patients.

TI  - [A bacteriology analysis from infected root canals of human deciduous teeth]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a basis for therapy and prevention, the flora of infected root canals of human deciduous teeth was analyzed.METHODS: By immediate-enzyme method, the bacteria compositions of 22 cases with infected root canals of deciduous teeth, including 8 cases with acute periapical inflammation and 14 with chronic ones, were examined. RESULTS: Among 240 strains bactera, 200 strains were obligate anaerobes, belonging to the genera peptostreptococcus, bacteriodes, veillonella, eubacterrum, propionibacterium, actinomyces and fusobacterium. Bacteriodes and eusobacterium especially B. gingivalis and F. nucleatum have been more frequently isolated from root canals with acute periapical inflammation than that with chronic ones (P<0.05). In chronic cases, veillonella especially V. parvula, were more frequently isolated than acute inflammation. CONCLUSION: Periaplcal inflammation of deciduous teeth was mixed polymicrobial infections regardless of acute or chronic cases and anaerobic bacteria were dominated. B. gingivalis and F. nucleatum probably were related to acute periapical inflammation of deciduous teeth. The effect of V. parvula on chronic periapical innammation of deciduous teeth should not be neglected.
TI  - [Dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. METHODS: Eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Provotella intermedium (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces viscosus (Av) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) were used. These eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified BM medium supplemented with 2.5 g/L porcine gastric mucin, respectively. After 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial Gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. RESULTS: Biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (P < 0.001). Biofilms of Aa were thinner than those of Ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by Ss and Aa per time point. Three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of Gram-negative periodontal pathogens. The relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.
TI  - Geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. The purpose of this study was to use PCR to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. Microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in Portland, Oregon, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. PCRs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene were used for detection of the bacteria after DNA extraction from each clinical sample. Statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella tannerae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Enterococcus faecalis. These results suggest that differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum induces premature and term stillbirths in pregnant mice:  implication of oral bacteria in preterm birth.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe ubiquitous to the oral cavity. It is associated with periodontal disease. It is also associated with preterm birth and has been isolated from the amniotic fluid, placenta, and chorioamnionic membranes of women delivering prematurely. Periodontal disease is a newly recognized risk factor for preterm birth. This study examined the possible mechanism underlying the link between these two diseases. F. nucleatum strains isolated from amniotic fluids and placentas along with those isolated from orally related sources invaded both epithelial and endothelial cells. The invasive ability may enable F. nucleatum to colonize and infect the pregnant uterus. Transient bacteremia caused by periodontal infection may facilitate bacterial transmission from the oral cavity to the uterus. To test this hypothesis, we intravenously injected F. nucleatum into pregnant CF-1 mice. The injection resulted in premature delivery, stillbirths, and nonsustained live births. The bacterial infection was restricted inside the uterus, without spreading systemically. F. nucleatum was first detected in the blood vessels in murine placentas. Invasion of the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels was observed. The bacteria then crossed the endothelium, proliferated in surrounding tissues, and finally spread to the amniotic fluid. The pattern of infection paralleled that in humans. This study represents the first evidence that F. nucleatum may be transmitted hematogenously to the placenta and cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. The results strengthen the link between periodontal disease and preterm birth. Our study also indicates that invasion may be an important virulence mechanism for F. nucleatum to infect the placenta.
TI  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (HBD-2 and HBD-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. A few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. However, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of HBD-2 and HBD-3 against a collection of oral organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida albicans). Radial diffusion assays were used to test HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. There was significant variability in MICs, which was strain specific rather than species specific. MICs ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-3. HBD-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. Overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, respectively. HBD-2 and HBD-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against the Candida species evaluated. Interestingly, an association between HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities was noted. This suggests that the two peptides may have similar mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. The lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and Candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. Finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Relationship between tongue coating and secretory-immunoglobulin A level in saliva obtained from patients complaining of oral malodor.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to confirm the relationships between oral malodor  and periodontal condition, oral malodor and tongue coating, and to investigate the secretory-immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) level in saliva in relation to the accumulation of tongue coating. METHODS: Fifty-four patients complaining of oral malodor were included in the study. Their periodontal conditions, tongue coating status and salivary characteristics (flow rate, protein and S-IgA concentrations) were assessed in addition to the level of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) in oral cavity. The patients were divided into three groups according to their tongue coating level. RESULTS: There are significant relationships between oral malodor and specific periodontal parameters used. The degree of tongue coating was also significantly correlated with the amount of H2S, CH3SH and the total amount of VSC determined. The concentration of S-IgA in the group identified as slight tongue coating was significantly higher than in the moderate or the severe group. By Western immunoblotting analysis, a high level of S-IgA specific to Streptococcus species was recognized in all groups, whereas the reactivity of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum with S-IgA was very weak in both the slight and the moderate groups. CONCLUSION: Data herein indicate that tongue coating is closely related to oral malodor. Furthermore, S-IgA in saliva may influence the accumulation of tongue coating, and S-IgA antibodies directed to Streptococcus species may play a role in protective immunity against the initial colonization of tongue plaque.
TI  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for Porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  - Cohesive interactions between Porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as Streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role in the colonization of P. gingivalis in periodontal sites. Although P. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with S. oralis, the S. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. We identified the coadhesin of S. oralis ATCC 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. We found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kDa. Dot blot and Western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kDa protein to P. gingivalis fimbriae. Further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between P. gingivalis and S. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. Analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Next, we cloned the gene that encodes S. oralis GAPDH and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of GAPDHs of various bacteria, including Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. To confirm the contribution of S. oralis GAPDH to the interaction with P. gingivalis, a recombinant GAPDH protein was generated in Escherichia coli; this protein bound to P. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. These results suggest that S. oralis GAPDH functions as a coadhesin for P. gingivalis fimbriae. In addition, considering the high degree of homology of the GAPDHs of various bacteria, those of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Association of T CD4 lymphocyte levels and subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in HIV-infected Brazilians under HAART.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the subgingival microbiota of HIV-infected patients with chronic periodontitis and different T CD4 lymphocyte levels under HAART. STUDY DESIGN: 64 HIV+ patients (mean age 34.5 +/- 7.3; 75% males) were distributed into Group I: chronic periodontitis (> or = 3 sites with probing pocket depth (PPD) and/or clinical attachment level (CAL) > or = 5 mm); and Group II: periodontal health (no sites with PPD > 3 mm and/or CAL > 4 mm). All subjects received conventional periodontal therapy. Periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated at 6 sites/tooth in all teeth at baseline and 4 months after therapy. The levels of T CD4 were obtained from the patient's medical record. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the 6 sites with the largest pocket depth in each subject of Group I, and 6 randomly selected sites in subjects of Group II. The presence of 22 subgingival species was determined using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Significant microbiological differences within and among groups were sought using Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively. Relationships between T CD4 levels and microbiological parameters were determined using Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the HIV-infected patients represented AIDS cases, although 69% of them were periodontally healthy. The T CD4 lymphocyte mean level was 333 cells/mm3 and viral load was 12,815 +/- 24,607 copies/mm3. Yet, the prevalence of chronic periodontitis was relatively low (36%). Several periodontal pathogens, in particular T. forsythensis (P < .05), were more prevalent in HIV-positive patients with periodontitis than in HIV-positive subjects with periodontal health. Most of the species decreased in frequency after therapy, particularly P. gingivalis (P < .05). E. faecalis and F. nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of patients with chronic periodontitis and lower levels of T CD4 (P < .05), while beneficial species tended to be more frequently detected in individuals with T CD4 counts over 500 cells/mm3. CONCLUSION: The subgingival microbiota of HIV-infected patients with chronic periodontitis include a high prevalence of classical periodontal pathogens observed in non-infected individuals. Furthermore, the severe immunosuppression seems to favor the colonization by these species, as well as by species not commonly found in the subgingival microbiota.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Relationship between periodontal pocket sulfide levels and subgingival species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many species implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). This investigation examined the relationship between levels of sulfide and subgingival bacterial species in the same periodontal pockets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty chronic periodontitis subjects were measured clinically at six sites per tooth for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples, taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth, were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Sulfide levels were measured at the same sites using a Diamond Probe/Perio 2000 system. Clinical and microbiological data were averaged for sulfide-positive and -negative sites separately in each subject and then averaged across subjects. Significance differences in clinical and microbial parameters between sulfide-positive and -negative sites were sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) at sulfide-negative and -positive sites were 44.0 +/- 9.9 and 65.0 +/- 13.3, respectively (p < 0.01). Seventeen species were found at significantly higher levels in sulfide-positive than -negative sites. These included abundant producers of VSC such as members of the genera Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Prevotella, Treponema and Eubacterium, and Bacteriodes forsythus, Selenomonas noxia and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella intermedia, Bacteriodes forsythus, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Treponema denticola exhibited the greatest difference in mean counts between sulfide-negative and -positive sites. Orange and red complex species were at higher counts at shallow (< 4 mm) sulfide-positive than shallow sulfide-negative sites. Although not statistically significant, mean clinical parameters were somewhat higher at sulfide-positive than sulfide-negative sites. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-pocket sulfide levels reflect the levels of sulfide-producing species and may provide useful diagnostic information.
TI  - Effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of Staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  - Vesicles from the outer membrane of Porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of Streptococcus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Actinomyces viscosus. We found that in the presence of P. gingivalis vesicles, Staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with Streptococcus spp., and the mycelium-type Candida albicans, but not the yeast type. Autoaggregation of S. aureus in the presence of P. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by L-arginine, L-lysine, and L-cysteine. Both the methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) strains of S. aureus were able to coaggregate with Streptococcus spp., A. naeslundii, and A. viscosus when they were treated with P. gingivalis vesicles. P. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type C. albicans coaggregated with S. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. These results indicate that strains of S. aureus, including MRSA, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when P. gingivalis is present.
TI  - Clonal similarity of salivary and nasopharyngeal Fusobacterium nucleatum in infants with acute otitis media experience.
AB  - The environment of an infant's nasopharynx during acute otitis media (AOM) favours the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which can be recovered frequently during infection, but hardly at all if the infant is healthy. The aim of this investigation was to identify the potential source and inoculation route of anaerobes that were present in the nasopharynx. Eleven Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates that were collected through the nasal cavity from the nasopharynx of eight infants with a history of AOM, and 161 F. nucleatum isolates from the saliva of the same infants, were typed to the clonal level by using arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). In five of the eight infants examined, identical AP-PCR types were found among nasopharyngeal and salivary isolates. As anaerobes seem to be present only transiently in the nasopharynx and salivary contamination of the nasopharyngeal samples can be excluded, this observation indicates that the source of nasopharyngeal anaerobes is the oral cavity and that saliva is their transmission vehicle.
TI  - Multiplex FISH analysis of a six-species bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Established procedures use different and seemingly incompatible experimental protocols for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure, based on FISH and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), for the analysis of the spatial organization of in vitro biofilms containing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive oral bacteria. Biofilms composed of the six oral species Actinomyces naeslundii, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Veillonella dispar were grown anaerobically for 64.5 h at 37 degrees C on hydroxyapatite disks preconditioned with saliva. Conditions for the simultaneous in situ hybridization of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were sought by systematic variation of fixation and exposure to lysozyme. After fixation and permeabilization biofilms were labeled by FISH with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes ANA103 (for the detection of A. naeslundii), EUK116 (C. albicans), FUS664 (F. nucleatum), MIT447 and MIT588 (S. oralis), SOB174 (S. sobrinus), and VEI217 (V. dispar). Probes were used as 6-FAM, Cy3 or Cy5 conjugates, resulting in green, orange-red or deep-red fluorescence of target cells, respectively. Thus, with two independent triple-hybridizations with three probes carrying different fluorescence-tags, all six species could be visualized. Results show that the simultaneous investigation by FISH of complex biofilms composed of multiple bacterial species with differential Gram-staining properties is possible. In combination with the optical sectioning properties of CLSM the technique holds great promise for the analysis of spatial alterations in biofilm composition in response to environmental challenges.
TI  - Innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  - The innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  The human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hBD-2 and hBD-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. Previous studies showed that hBD-2 was induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the NF-kappaB transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. The goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hBD-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of NF-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Different bacteria induced different levels of hBD-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal- and pathogen-stimulated cells. hBD-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the JNK and p38 pathways. However, in addition, hBD-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappaB. The results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hBD-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. We thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. METHODS: Autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel, subgingival calculus, and root caries. Periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. RESULTS: Subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. The calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655 nm. The autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. However, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or blood clots. For clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. CONCLUSION: The autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting subgingival calculus and root caries.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus. We tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. The essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. Minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. Periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. Tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against P. gingivalis. All the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of S. mutans. This study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. From the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.
TI  - Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
TI  - Antagonistic interactions among Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  - Microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. The aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and Lactobacillus casei, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum isolated from saliva. Different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain, alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double layer method; and (d) OD(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of Lactobacillus strains in LAPTg broth with different volumes of F. nucleatum supernatant. P. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus growth, except for L. casei, when the double plaque method was used. F. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all Lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. F. nucleatum inhibited L. casei growth whatever the method used. The substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. None of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of P. intermedia or F. nucleatum.
TI  - The influence of organic load on the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate bacterial growth after contact with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl;  1 and 5%) and chlorhexidine (CHX; 0.12, 0.5 and 1%) in vitro with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin (BSA) 0.5%). METHODOLOGY: Bacterial samples (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for varying intervals of time: immediately (t0), 5 min (t5), 15 min (t15) and 30 min (t30). Each test was repeated 10 times. In half of the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added as organic material in an attempt to simulate the organic tissue present in the root canal system. Bacterial growth under appropriate condition of incubation was evaluated and compared for each microorganism at all time intervals. RESULTS: A 0.12% CHX solution did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval. One percent CHX eliminated all strains, as did both NaOCl concentrations. BSA did not interfere substantially with the antimicrobial activity of any of the irrigating solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Under the condition of this study, a 0.12% CHX solution was ineffective at killing E. faecalis.
TI  - Expression of MHC Class II, CD70, CD80, CD86 and pro-inflammatory cytokines is differentially regulated in oral epithelial cells following bacterial challenge.
AB  - Oral epithelium may play a regulatory role in local immune responses when interacting with bacteria. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of selected bacterial pathogens found in periodontal and endodontic infections on oral epithelial cells. Expression of cell surface molecules (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II, CD54, CD70, CD80 and CD86) and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) in response to selected bacterial challenge were examined on an immortalized oral epithelial cell line, HOK-18A and a skin epithelial cell line, HaCaT. Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces israelii, Fusobacterium nucleatum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or primary human periradicular exudate from a granuloma were co-cultured with epithelial cells for 4 or 24 h. Subsequently, cell surface expression of MHC Class II, CD54, CD70, CD80 and CD86, along with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were determined using flow cytometry, ELISA and RT-PCR. Results indicated that the selected oral bacteria have greater effects on oral versus skin epithelial cells. F. nucleatum increased MHC Class II and CD54 (ICAM-1) cell surface expression on HOK-18A and HaCaT cells. A. israelii also had enhancing effects on the expression of CD54 and MHC Class II. A. israelii and LPS induced a 2.8-fold (P < 0.001) and 4.4-fold (P < 0.005) TNF-alpha secretion, respectively, while F. nucleatum and LPS induced a 10-fold (P < 0.0004) and 6-fold (P < 0.01) IL-1beta secretion, respectively by HOK-18A. Interestingly, CD70, CD80, and CD86 were generally decreased upon bacteria and LPS challenge on HOK-18A. The effects of increased MHC Class II and decreased CD70 were also evident with challenge of human periradicular exudate on HOK-18A. The implications of the study are unique in that oral epithelial cells may play both activating and inhibitory roles in the host immune response towards infection by oral bacteria. We introduce a concept of 'dormancy' where the differential expression of key cell surface antigens on oral epithelial cells may keep the recruited immune effector cells in a state of unresponsiveness, thus contributing to the long term quiescent period observed in many periodontal and endodontic lesions.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum: a rare cause of bacteremia in neutropenic patients with  leukemia and lymphoma.
AB  - Although anaerobic bacteremias are uncommon in oncohematologic patients, nevertheless they have been considered an emergent problem in the last few years. Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus commonly present in the oral cavity and in the respiratory and genito-urinary tracts. Over a 10-year period 18 episodes of F. nucleatum bacteremia in patients with hematological malignances (15 leukemias and 3 lymphomas) have been observed in our Department of Hematology. Predisposing factors included oropharyngeal mucositis and severe neutropenia owing to intensive chemotherapy. In our experience no septic shock occurred and the outcome of bacteremias caused by F. nucleatum was favorable.
TI  - Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  - Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.
TI  - Intracellular calcium in signaling human beta-defensin-2 expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - Expression of human beta-defensins is correlated with differentiation in the oral epithelium, consistent with their function as part of the epithelial antimicrobial barrier. Because calcium is a known regulator of epithelial differentiation, we tested the hypothesis that calcium concentration mediates beta-defensin expression. Gingival epithelial cells were cultured in medium containing low calcium concentration (0.03 mM), then either changed to high extracellular calcium concentrations or stimulated with thapsigargin to release intracellular calcium stores in the presence or absence of BAPTA-AM, a calcium chelator. Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) mRNA expression was rapidly induced by thapsigargin, and more slowly induced by high extracellular calcium. Induction of hBD-2 peptide was confirmed by immunofluorescence. BAPTA-AM inhibited hBD-2 induction by both thapsigargin and calcium in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, BAPTA-AM inhibited hBD-2 induction by a bacterial stimulant. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that intracellular calcium is a critical mediator of hBD-2 expression. Abbreviations used in this study are: BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester); DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide; F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HBDs, human beta-defensins; HGECs, human gingival epithelial cells; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; and RT-PCR, reverse-transcriptase/polymerase chain-reaction.
TI  - Fusobacterial brain abscess: a review of five cases and an analysis of possible pathogenesis.
AB  - OBJECT: The cases of five patients with fusobacterial brain abscess are presented. The authors discuss their attempt to determine the pathogenesis. METHODS: The clinical and microbiological features of five cases of fusobacterial brain abscess are reviewed. Isolates of 2031 Fusobacterium spp. and other anaerobes collected (1989-2002) at our institution were analyzed and compared for incidences and isolation sources. The findings were correlated with extensive literature on the subject. The five patients were men between 45 and 74 years of age. All experienced an insidious onset of the disease and probable hematogenous seeding of the organism(s). One patient had a monomicrobic Fusobacterium necrophorum abscess, whereas the others had polymicrobic F. nucleatum abscesses. Despite surgery and a regimen of antibiotic medications and dexamethasone, three patients experienced a paradoxical deterioration 3 days postoperatively that necessitated reevacuation of the lesion. The evacuants observed at that time contained numerous leukocytes but no microorganisms, suggesting intensified inflammation as the likely cause of deterioration. This explanation is supported by literature that fusobacteria strongly activate neutrophils. An analysis of the 2031 anaerobes from blood, wounds, and abscesses showed the considerable virulence of Fusobacterium spp., which were able to enter and/or sustain themselves in the blood circulation. This pattern was similar to that of Clostridium spp., but different from those of Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., which were less invasive but more abundant. CONCLUSIONS: Some fusobacterial brain abscesses may be associated with a paradoxical postoperative deterioration, which is probably due to intensified inflammation following treatment. The blood-borne dissemination and invasive behavior of fusobacteria likely initiate such a brain abscess, and further seeding of other synergic bacteria leads to a polymicrobic abscess.
TI  - [Ribotyping Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates from healthy and diseased periodontium].
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is one of the most frequently cultured bacteria from subgingival plaque. It can be isolated from active periodontal lesions as well as from healthy sites. Currently, F. nucleatum has been divided into five subspecies. An early hypothesis suggested an association between certain subspecies and periodontal disease or health. On the other hand, a broad heterogeneity between F. nucleatum isolates has been suggested, so that the subspeciation scheme and therefore the proposed association may not be valid. The purpose of the present study was to analyze if clonal differences exist between human F. nucleatum isolates from either periodontally healthy or diseased individuals. 23 F. nucleatum isolates from periodontally healthy and 17 isolates from periodontally diseased individuals were analysed by ribotyping. A broad genetic heterogeneity was present, although some of the isolates from periodontally healthy individuals were genotypically identical. However, no clonal differences between isolates from periodontally healthy or diseased individuals was detected.
TI  - Intracellular production and extracellular release of oxygen radicals by PMNs and oxidative stress on PMNs during phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - In this study we investigated intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) during the phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria. In in vitro assays, bacteria of the species Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were phagocytosed at 37 degrees C for 4 h by purified peripheral human PMNs from healthy subjects (n = 6). Superoxide production during phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry and with a fluorescence/luminescence microplate reader. After phagocytosis, oxidative stress was determined by flow cytometry. Both the intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by PMNs phagocytosing F. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of PMNs phagocytosing P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans ( P < 0.01 by the Mann-Whitney test). Moreover, after 4 h of incubation, the oxidative stress of PMNs phagocytosing F. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of PMNs phagocytosing P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. We conclude that a high level of superoxide production by PMNs may damage not only periodontopathic bacteria but also PMNs themselves, and may be correlated with the destruction of periodontal tissue.
TI  - Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in the sputum of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of anaerobic bacteria in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The level of the Ig-A class to two organisms (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia) was determined in the sputum of 25 patients with AECB and 25 control patients. The presence and level of these antibodies were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The median sputum antibody level for F nucleatum and P intermedia were significantly higher in patients with AECB as compared to control patients (p < 0.05). The IgA levels for F nucleatum was 3.5 times higher in patients with AECB and 3.8 times greater for P intermedia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time an elevated sputum antibody titers in patients with AECB to F nucleatum and P intermedia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine using a contact test.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%). Bacterial samples (ATCC) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were submitted to a contact test. Solutions were evaluated at different time intervals: immediately, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after contact and repeated 10 times. The results of the contact test showed that 0.12% chlorhexidine did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval, while 0.5% and 1% chlorhexidine and 1% and 5% sodium hypochlorite did. These results permit us to conclude that to obtain better antimicrobial activity, chlorhexidine in a concentration greater than 0.12% should be used.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Multiple brain abscesses caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum treated conservatively.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple brain abscesses are serious neurological problems with high  mortality and disabling morbidity. The frequency is rising as a result of AIDS and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients. CASE STUDY: A 59-year-old woman developed signs and symptoms of diffuse brain dysfunction including fever and neck stiffness. A brain CT scan demonstrated nine contrast-enhancing ring-shaped lesions. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid using PCR-technique revealed DNA of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Conservative treatment with antibiotics was successful. The patient recovered with only mild cognitive deficits. RESULTS: The experience of our patient and the review of the literature indicate that multiple brain abscesses due to Fusobacterium nucleatum are rare. The most probable source is oral infection. CONCLUSION: Multiple brain abscesses may be caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis using PCR technique is helpful with diagnosis. Conservative management can be successful.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. Although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of S. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. To determine whether S. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we examined the ability of S. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. Our results show that S. salivarius coaggregated with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. However, only fimbriated S. salivarius cells were able to coaggregate with P. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. Heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and EDTA, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between S. salivarius and periodontopathogens.
TI  - Effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  - Oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. Steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate-containing mouthwash (CHXM) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. The microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CHXM caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (P < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. The degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. DGGE showed that CHXM exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in Prevotella sp. and Selenomonas infelix. Pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to CHX, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. Determination of the MICs of triclosan, CHX, erythromycin, penicillin V, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of CHXM exposure, showed that CHXM exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to CHX (P < 0.05). Changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. In conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to CHXM represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Antimicrobial constituents from goldenseal (the Rhizomes of Hydrastis canadensis) against selected oral pathogens.
AB  - Two new C-methyl flavonoids, 6,8-di- C-methylluteolin 7-methyl ether (1) and 6- C-methylluteolin 7-methyl ether (2), were isolated from a commercially available sample of the roots of Hydrastis canadensis, along with seven known compounds, berberine (3), beta-hydrastine (4), canadine (5), canadaline (6), isocorypalmine (7), canadinic acid (8), and beta-sitosterol 3- O-beta- D-glucoside (9). The structures of the new compounds 1 and 2 were elucidated on the basis of their spectral data including 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Of these isolates, berberine (3) and, to a lesser extent, 1 and 2, showed antimicrobial activity when evaluated against the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Berberine (3) exhibited an additive antimicrobial effect when tested against S. mutans in combination with 1.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria from odontogenic infections in Taiwan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of facultative and anaerobic odontogenic infectious flora to various antibiotics. We assessed 178 bacterial strains isolated from 74 patients with odontogenic infections. The E-test was used to determine susceptibility. The microbial flora was predominantly facultative gram-positive organisms and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that ampicillin resistance was found with a very high level of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in approximately one third of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Eikenella corrodens isolates (MIC > or = 8 microg/mL). Greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with ampicillin, but even beta-lactamase inhibitor incorporated amoxicillin showed resistance in more than 10% of all groups except viridans group streptococci and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Tetracycline and erythromycin were considerably less active against the majority of the tested bacterial strains, while minocycline and doxycycline exerted strong antimicrobial activity and could inhibit strains grown at a very low concentration. Among all the tested antibiotics, travofloxacin appears to be a promising drug expressing the highest activities (MIC90 < or = 1 microg/mL), and was regarded as a potent bactericidal drug in odontogenic infections.
TI  - Positive and negative bacterial associations involving Dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  - Dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic Gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. In this study, samples taken from abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving D. pneumosintes. DNA was extracted from the samples, and the presence of D. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. Positive and negative associations involving D. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of D. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. The association between the pairs containing D. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. D. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the other target species. D. pneumosintes was positively associated with Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, T. pectinovorum, and T. vincentii. Negative associations were observed with Bacteroides forsythus, P. gingivalis, and Actinomyces israelii. No pair containing D. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). The findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of D. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen, usually in a mixed infection. Positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as T. denticola and P. endodontalis, suggest that bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.
TI  - Characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In view of its localization, brain abscess (BA) usually requires medical and surgical care. A broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. Recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. A retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented BA admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. BA due to anaerobic bacteria (group A) were compared with other cases (group B) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of BA with isolated anaerobic bacteria. Between 1991 and 2000, BA were diagnosed in 42 patients (28M, 14F, mean age 54.6 y). No differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with BA caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. Using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with BA. Anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. The most frequently isolated species were Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), Prevotella sp. (n = 8), Actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and Bacteroides sp. (n = 4). Compared with group B, group A had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and ear, nose and throat (ENT) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). These results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in BA. The presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ENT infection, or both. Therapy should take into account this high frequency.
TI  - Unusual presentation of Lemierre's syndrome due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - We report a case of Lemierre's syndrome due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in a previously healthy 19-year-old male. This is the first case report of Lemierre's syndrome due to thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein. The patient had a rapid clinical response to anticoagulation and antibiotics, as supported by anecdotal evidence.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Effect of smoking and periodontal treatment on the subgingival microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of smoking on the prevalence of periodontal pathogens after periodontal treatment is still not clear. Some studies found no effect of the smoking status on the prevalence of periodontal pathogens after therapy, whereas others did. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the influence of smoking on the treatment of periodontitis and the composition of the subgingival microflora. METHOD: The study included 59 periodontitis patients (mean age 41.5 years): 30 smokers and 29 nonsmokers. The treatment consisted of initial periodontal therapy and, if necessary, surgery and/or antibiotics. Clinical and microbiological data were obtained before and after treatment at the deepest site in each quadrant. A pooled sample was analysed for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotalla intermedia (Pi), Bacteroides forsythus (Bf), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Peptostreptococcus micros (Pm). RESULTS: For smokers and nonsmokers a significant improvement of the clinical condition was found after treatment. A decrease could be assessed for bleeding on probing (smokers: 0.46; nonsmokers: 0.52) and probing pocket depth (PPD) (smokers: 1.64 mm; nonsmokers: 2.09 mm). Furthermore, both groups showed gain of attachment (smokers: 0.68 mm; nonsmokers: 1.46 mm). No significant difference in bleeding on probing and PPD reduction was found between smokers and nonsmokers. In contrast, nonsmokers showed significantly more gain of attachment than smokers. The microbiological results revealed no differences in the prevalence of the various bacteria between smokers and nonsmokers before treatment. After treatment in nonsmokers, a significant decrease was found in the prevalence of Aa (11-3), Pg (17-7), Pi (27-11), Bf (27-11), Fn (28-20) and Pm (27-17). In smokers, a significant decrease could be shown only for the prevalence of Pg (15-5). CONCLUSIONS: Nonsmokers showed more gain of attachment and a greater decrease in the prevalence of periodontal bacteria as compared to smokers. The phenomenon that among smokers, more patients remain culture positive for periodontal pathogens after therapy, may contribute to the often observed unfavourable treatment results in smoker periodontitis patients.
TI  - Lethal photosensitization of periodontal pathogens by a red-filtered Xenon lamp in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of Helium-Neon (He-Ne) laser irradiation of a photosensitizer to induce localized phototoxic effects that kill periodontal pathogens is well documented and is termed photodynamic therapy (PDT). OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential of a conventional light source (red-filtered Xenon lamp) to activate toluidine blue O (TBO) in vitro and determined in vitro model parameters that may be used in future in vivo trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was used as the primary test bacterium. RESULTS: Treatment with a 2.2 J/cm2 light dose and 50 micro g/ml TBO concentration resulted in a bacterial kill of 2.43 +/- 0.39 logs with the He-Ne laser control and 3.34 +/- 0.24 logs with the lamp, a near 10-fold increase (p = 0.028). Increases in light intensity produced significantly higher killing (p = 0.012) that plateaued at 25 mW/cm2. There was a linear relationship between light dose and bacterial killing (r2 = 0.916); as light dose was increased bacterial survival decreased. No such relationship was found for the drug concentrations tested. Addition of serum or blood at 50% v/v to the P. gingivalis suspension prior to irradiation diminished killing from approximately 5 logs to 3 logs at 10 J/cm2. When serum was washed off, killing returned to 5 logs for all species tested except Bacteroides forsythus (3.92 +/- 0.68 logs kill). CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that PDT utilizing a conventional light source is at least as effective as laser-induced treatment in vitro. Furthermore, PDT achieves significant bactericidal activity in the presence of serum and blood when used with the set parameters of 10 J/cm2, 100 mW/cm2 and 12.5 micro g/ml TBO.
TI  - Changes in growth and polyglucose synthesis in response to fructose metabolism by Fusobacterium nucleatum grown in continuous culture.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, grown in a chemically defined medium at micro(rel) = 0.5, produced greater cell yields and undetectable levels of intracellular polyglucose (IP) when fructose was substituted for glucose. The utilisation and metabolism of fructose by growing cells was studied and the effect of the energy-yielding amino acids, glutamate, serine, histidine and lysine on cell yield, IP synthesis and acidic end-products was investigated. When F. nucleatum was grown on elevated amino acid levels, IP was synthesised from fructose and amino acids were metabolised to lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate. Under these conditions, IP synthesis was associated with the cells being replete with amino acid-derived energy; an observation supported by the absence of IP when the levels of (energy yielding) amino acids were reduced. Compared with fructose, glucose was less efficiently removed from the growth medium and produced less biomass and markedly lower levels of IP during energy-limited growth.
TI  - Bacteria-binding plasma proteins in pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite in vitro and on teeth in vivo.
AB  - Previous studies on dental pellicle formation and bacterial adherence have focussed on saliva and its components. The tooth surface is, however, also exposed to the plasma-derived crevicular fluid. In the present study, (i). plasma proteins in in vitro and in vivo pellicles were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotting and image analysis and (ii). the adherence of periodontopathogenic bacteria to experimental plasma and saliva pellicles was examined using radio-labelled bacteria and liquid scintillation counting. The plasma components fibrinogen, fibronectin, albumin and IgG were incorporated from plasma in the experimental pellicle and mediated the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces naeslundii. These proteins were also readily detected in in vivo pellicles and were found to a higher extent in pellicles formed at the gingival part of the tooth surface than at the incisal part.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Althaea officinalis L. roots, Arnica montana L. flowers, Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hamamelis virginiana L. leaves, Illicium verum Hook. fruits and Melissa officinalis L. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veilonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The methanol extracts of H. virginiana and A. montana and, to a lesser extent, A. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (MIC < or = 2048 mg/L) against many of the species tested. In comparison, M. officinalis and C. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (MIC > or = 2048 mg/L) against all the tested species with the exception of Prevotella sp. Illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against E. corrodens. The results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of H. virginiana, A. montana and A. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.
TI  - Genome analysis of F. nucleatum sub spp vincentii and its comparison with the genome of F. nucleatum ATCC 25586.
AB  - We present the draft genome sequence and its analysis for Fusobacterium nucleatum sub spp. vincentii (FNV), and compare that genome with F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 (FN). A total of 441 FNV open reading frames (ORFs) with no orthologs in FN have been identified. Of these, 118 ORFs have no known function and are unique to FNV, whereas 323 ORFs have functional orthologs in other organisms. In addition to the excretion of butyrate, H2S and ammonia-like FN, FNV has the additional capability to excrete lactate and aminobutyrate. Unlike FN, FNV is likely to incorporate galactopyranose, galacturonate, and sialic acid into its O-antigen. It appears to transport ferrous iron by an anaerobic ferrous transporter. Genes for eukaryotic type serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase, transpeptidase E-transglycosylase Pbp1A are found in FNV but not in FN. Unique ABC transporters, cryptic phages, and three types of restriction-modification systems have been identified in FNV. ORFs for ethanolamine utilization, thermostable carboxypeptidase, gamma glutamyl-transpeptidase, and deblocking aminopeptidases are absent from FNV. FNV, like FN, lacks the classical catalase-peroxidase system, but thioredoxin/glutaredoxin enzymes might alleviate oxidative stress. Genes for resistance to antibiotics such as acriflavin, bacitracin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, florfenicol, and other general multidrug resistance are present. These capabilities allow Fusobacteria to survive in a mixed culture in the mouth.
TI  - Genomics of oral bacteria.
AB  - Advances in bacterial genetics came with the discovery of the genetic code, followed by the development of recombinant DNA technologies. Now the field is undergoing a new revolution because of investigators' ability to sequence and assemble complete bacterial genomes. Over 200 genome projects have been completed or are in progress, and the oral microbiology research community has benefited through projects for oral bacteria and their non-oral-pathogen relatives. This review describes features of several oral bacterial genomes, and emphasizes the themes of species relationships, comparative genomics, and lateral gene transfer. Genomics is having a broad impact on basic research in microbial pathogenesis, and will lead to new approaches in clinical research and therapeutics. The oral microbiota is a unique community especially suited for new challenges to sequence the metagenomes of microbial consortia, and the genomes of uncultivable bacteria.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of Mangifera indica on anaerobic dental microglora based on in vivo studies.
AB  - The present study was carried out to compare the subgingival plaque microflora in mango leaf users. Fifty subjects of both sexes, 25 of them used tooth brush and 25 used mango leaf as their home care hygiene device were included in the study. The microbiological evaluation for specific bacterial counts of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus micros were carried out for all subject. Specific microbial evaluation revealed significant decrease in the proportion of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis in mango leaf users compared to tooth brush users. It shows that mangiferin possesses antibacterial activity in vivo against specific periodontal pathogens such as P. intermedia and P. gingivalis. Use of mango leaf in conjunction with a tooth brush will be a good home care device for maintenance of oral hygiene.
TI  - Additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  - It is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. Unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to Ca(OH)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. The objective of this study was to identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. Ca(OH)2 was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. Efficacy of killing was compared for (a) Ca(OH)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (ZnO) points alone; (c) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO points; (d) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points; and (e) Ca(OH)2 points combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points. Common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. In the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. Samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. Gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by Ca(OH)2 alone. Combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. For the inactivation of the Gram-positive bacteria P. micros and S. intermedius, a combination of Ca(OH)2 and ZnO/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria faster than Ca(OH)2 alone. For E. faecalis, combining Ca(OH)2 suspension with ZnO/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. The results of this study support the use of a combination of Ca(OH)2 and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of P. micros and S. intermedius from infected root canals.
TI  - [Early diagnosis of bacterial brain abscesses: interest of diffusion-weighted MRI].
AB  - Three cases of bacterial brain abscesses, in immunocompetent patients, are reported. In all these cases, the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MRI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map has permitted an early diagnosis and a rapid treatment. This emergency MRI showed in the three cases a low signal on TI-weighted images, a high signal on T2-weighted and echo-planar images, and a decrease of ADC (0.36- 0.49 x 10(-3) mm2/s). So, this new MRI technique provides an available and rapid element in the brain abscess diagnosis which often remains a complex clinical and radiological diagnosis.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lipopolysaccharide mediates coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Purified Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to be able to bind Fusobacterium nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of F. nucleatum to A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b. Sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b LPS to the F. nucleatum lectin are the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4, and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 6 of D-galactose, indicating that the beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine in the serotype b LPS trisaccharide repeating unit is the monosaccharide residue recognized by the F. nucleatum lectin. These data strongly suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b LPS is one of the receptors responsible for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation of A. actinomycetemcomitans to fusobacteria.
TI  - PCR method is essential for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  - Tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by Mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. M. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. To evaluate the risk of M. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of M. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection rates by PCR in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. The detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. M. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. Strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of M. tuberculosis, but strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. The present study concludes that the PCR method is essential for detecting M. tuberculosis in oral samples.
TI  - Plasmid profile in oral Fusobacterium nucleatum from humans and Cebus apella monkeys.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a strict anaerobe and is indigenous of the human oral  cavity. This organism is commonly recovered from different monomicrobial and mixed infections in humans and animals. In this study, the plasmid profile, the plasmid stability and the penicillin-resistance association in oral F. nucleatum isolated from periodontal patients, healthy subjects and Cebus apella monkeys were evaluated. Forty-five F. nucleatum strains from patients, 38 from healthy subjects and seven from C. apella were identified and analyzed. Plasmid extraction was performed in all the isolated strains. These elements were found in 26.7% strains from patients and one strain from C. apella. Strains from healthy subjects did not show any plasmid. Most of strains showed two plasmid bands ranging from 4 to 16 Kb, but digestions with endonucleases showed that they belonged to a single plasmid. The plasmid profile was similar and stable in human and monkey strains. Also, plasmids were classified into three groups according to size. Two strains were positive to beta-lactamase production and no plasmid DNA-hybridization with a beta-lactamase gene probe was observed, suggesting a chromosomal resistance.
TI  - Bacterial penetration through canals of endodontically treated teeth in the presence or absence of the smear layer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to determine if the smear layer affects the passage of bacteria through or around obturating material as evidenced by penetration of bacteria through and out the canal. Specifically, this study focused on determining the effect of the smear layer on the magnitude of bacterial penetration through the apical foramen. METHODS: Thirty extracted, maxillary central or lateral incisors were collected. Teeth were randomly assigned (10 teeth per group) to three groups: (1) smear layer removed, (2) smear layer present, and (3) negative control. Canal preparation and obturation using lateral condensation, gutta percha, and AH 26 sealer was performed on all of the teeth. Removal of the smear layer was accomplished by rinsing with 17% EDTA. The model systems consisted of an upper chamber attached to the cemento-enamel junction and a lower chamber at the apices of the teeth. Standardized bacterial suspensions containing Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Peptostreptococcus micros were inoculated into the upper chambers. Models were incubated anaerobically at 37 degrees C. At various times over a 60-day period, samples were taken from the lower chamber and spiral-plated on selective-differential media to determine numbers and types of bacteria. RESULTS: Leakage results were as follows: (1) smear layer present-6/10 leaked; (2) smear layer removed-0/10 leaked; (3) negative control-0/10 leaked. Profiles of bacterial leakage were similar among the groups. F. nucleatum was the predominant microorganism. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that removal of the smear layer reduced the leakage of bacteria through the root canal system.
TI  - [Extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary to inflammatory gynecologic pathology].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present two cases of extrinsic ureteral obstruction secondary to gynaecological inflammatory diseases, and to perform a bibliographic review. METHODS: We present two cases of obstructive uropathy with uretero-hydronephrosis secondary to tubo-ovarian abscesses diagnosed at our department. Clinical features at presentation, diagnostic tests, and preoperative management are reported. RESULTS: We report the clinical resolution of each case and perform a review about this pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Extrinsic ureteral obstruction is a frequent problem in urology. Inflammatory gynaecologic disease should be included among possible causes at the time of differential diagnosis. A methodical diagnosis process allows defining the exact location of the obstruction, diagnostic possibilities, and most adequate treatment plan for each case. Although association of gynaecological pathology and urinary tract obstruction is well known, there are not many bibliographic references in the national and international literature.
TI  - The effects of a new mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride and zinc lactate on the microflora of oral halitosis patients: a dual-centre, double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  - AIM: This study evaluated the microbial effects of a newly formulated mouthwash (Halita) on oral halitosis patients. METHODS: Forty subjects were included in this dual-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select patients. At baseline and at 2 weeks post-treatment, full-mouth organoleptic odor scores, level of volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) and the Winkel Tongue Coating Index were recorded. Standardized samples of tongue coating, saliva and subgingival plaque were microbiologically investigated. Participants were randomly assigned to the test or placebo groups. RESULTS: High prevalences were observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis in tongue coating, saliva and subgingival plaque samples. A significant positive correlation between baseline total counts of P. gingivalis in saliva samples and organoleptic and VSC scores was found. Two weeks post-treatment there was a reduction in total anaerobic counts in all samples in the test group. A significant positive correlation was observed between the reduction in total counts in saliva samples and the reduction in organoleptic scores in the test group. Significant reductions in total counts and proportions of F. nucleatum and total counts of P. intermedia in tongue coating samples were observed in the test group. CONCLUSIONS: The test mouthwash demonstrated efficacy in reducing the microbiological parameters in three oral niches in moderate to severe halitosis patients without periodontitis, and this was correlated with the improvements in organoleptic and VSC scores but not with the tongue coating scores.
TI  - Can toothpaste or a toothbrush with antibacterial tufts prevent toothbrush contamination?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periopathogens and cariogenic species survive more than 48 hours on toothbrushes even under dry storage. This study examined a decontamination of toothbrushes by means of the bactericidal effect of different toothpastes or a special coating of the tufts. METHODS: Eight untreated periodontitis patients were professionally brushed, using a new toothbrush per quadrant and 3 different toothpastes containing either amine/stannous fluoride (AmF/SnF2), amine fluoride (AmF), or a mild surfactant as major antibacterial component (excipient), or no paste (C). The brushes were rinsed and stored dry at room temperature. At different time intervals, 4 tufts per toothbrush were processed for selective and non-selective culturing procedures. The protocol was repeated comparing AmF/SnF2 and C with 2 toothbrushes with coated tufts (coat1 and coat2). RESULTS: At baseline, C brushes (n = 16) harbored 10(7), 10(8), and 10(6) colony forming units (CFU) of aerobic, anaerobic, and black pigmented species, respectively. After 24 hours 10(6) CFU of aerobic and anaerobic species could still be cultured from 14 of the 16 brushes. Black-pigmented species remained detectable up to 4 hours; detection frequencies for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mutans at 24 hours were 5/16. With AmF/SnF2 and AmF toothpaste the number of adhering bacteria was already 2 log lower at baseline (P<0.05), but not for the excipient (0.5 log, P = 0.7). With AmF/SnF2 no vital species could be detected after 8 hours. AmF reduced the bacterial survival rate significantly more than the excipient, but less than AmF/SnF2 (P<0.05). The bactericidal effect of coat1 and coat2 was negligible when compared to C (P>0.20), and clearly inferior to the AmF/SnF2 paste (P<0.0001). After 24 hours these brushes still harbored >10(5) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: Toothpastes can significantly reduce contamination of toothbrushes, but their bactericidal activity is dependent on their composition. Coated tufts failed to limit the bacterial contamination.
TI  - Ovine periodontitis as a potential model for periodontal studies. Cross-sectional analysis of clinical, microbiological, and serum immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: : To investigate infection and host immunity patterns in sheep with naturally occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Eight periodontally healthy (HS) and eight periodontally diseased ewes (PDS) were selected. Subgingival plaque and sera were collected and examined for evidence of human periodontitis-associated pathogens. Serum IgG titers were measured by ELISA to multiple strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Dichelobacter nodosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as well as several purified antigens (cysteine proteases, LPS, K, and fimbriae). RESULTS: : Neither the organism Aa nor antigens to Aa were found in any animal. Most animals were positive for Pg, Bf, and Pi, but DNA probes detected no difference between HS and PDS relative to amounts of pathogens in subgingival plaque. PDS had significantly higher serum IgG titers to all Pg strains, to 50% of Bf strains, to the Pi and Fn strains, and to fimbriae and the two cysteine proteases (p-values ranging from 0.05 to 0.001). Regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between number of teeth lost and serum IgG antibody titers to whole-cell sonicate antigens of P. gingivalis strains (p<0.01) and body weight (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: : The presence of pathogens associated with periodontitis was reflected in differences in serum IgG titers between healthy and diseased sheep. This may have influenced animal body weight and might have systemic health and economic consequences. The data suggest that susceptible and non-susceptible sheep can be identified for periodontal research.
TI  - Ultrastructural analysis of an infected collagen-coated vascular graft.
AB  - The incidence of infection following arterial reconstruction using synthetic graft materials varies from less than 1 to 5%. One of three mechanisms is thought to be responsible: 1. intraoperative contamination, 2. extension from adjacent infected or colonized tissue, or 3. hematogenous or lymphogenous seeding. We present ultrastructural data of a patient with a polymicrobial graft infection due to a prostheto-enteric fistula 16 years after reconstruction of an aortobifemoral graft. The polymer surface showed signs of biodegradation and was completely covered with a layer of plasma proteins. Disrupted fibroblasts on the intersegmental graft surface were surrounded by bundles of collagen. Gram-negative rods and grampositive cocci were embedded in an extracellular EPS matrix. Bacterial culture confirmed growth of Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus species. Fibrin and granulation tissue from the neoadventitia started to mark off the inflammatory process. Transmission electron microscopy is a valuable tool for the investigation of alloplastic arterial devices. After 16 years of implantation the graft shows different signs of biodegradation.
TI  - Palmitoleic acid isomer (C16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). Total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium, caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. Fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. Lauric acid (C12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. The unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (C16:1delta6, cPA) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. Purified cPA (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. Organically synthesized cPA isomer gave MIC values comparable to the natural material. Both natural and synthetic cPA were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of Candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. Ethanol in combination with cPA exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and several methacillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. Palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - An immunohistological study of the localization of bacteria invading root pulpal  walls of teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  - We immunohistologically examined the prevalence and localization of bacteria invading dentinal tubules of the roots of teeth with infected canals. Forty extracted teeth with apical lesions were selected and divided into two groups: a group of untreated teeth and a group of canal-enlarged teeth. The bacteria in the specimens were detected by Brown-Brenn stain and the labeled-streptavidin-biotin method with specific antisera for 16-bacteria. Seventy percent of the examined teeth showed bacteria invading the dentinal tubules of the roots. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium alactolyticum, E. nodatum, Lactobacillus casei, and Peptostreptococcus micros were abundant. Even in the canal-enlarged group, invasion of bacteria was observed in 65% of teeth. This study revealed the actual condition of bacteria in infected root dentin and suggested that the canal-enlargement procedure could not completely remove all the bacteria in the infected dentinal tubules of the root.
TI  - Serum phenytoin concentration and IgG antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - Epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum IgG antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. Significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (P < 0.05) when compared with those without overgrowth. In addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth than of those without overgrowth (P < 0.01). Strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. However, no differences were found in serum IgG antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. These results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass for this unwanted side effect.
TI  - Periodontal microbiota and clinical periodontal status in a rural sample in southern Thailand.
AB  - We sought to determine (i) the association of subgingival bacterial profiles to clinical periodontal status in a population with limited access to dental care in Thailand, and (ii) the external validity of our earlier findings from a similar study in rural China. We examined 356 subjects, 30-39 yr old and 50-59 yr old, with respect to clinical periodontal status and subgingival plaque at maximally 14 sites per subject. Checkerboard hybridizations were used to analyse a total of 4343 samples. The prevalence of the 27 species investigated ranged between 87.2% and 100%. Discriminant analysis based on microbial profiles classified correctly 67.5% of all deep (> or = 5 mm) and 64.2% of all shallow sites, and 67.4% of all subjects with and 69.3% of all subjects without > or = 3 deep pockets. High colonization by 'red complex' bacteria was four times as likely (95% Confidence Limits (CL) 2.5-6.6) in subjects with > or = 10 sites with attachment loss of > or = 5 mm, and 4.3 times as likely (95% CL 2.6-7.1) in subjects with > or = 30 such sites. The data confirmed (i) the ubiquitous prevalence of the bacteria investigated in subjects with no regular access to dental care; and (ii) the high odds for periodontal pathology conferred by increased levels of specific periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and moxifloxacin (Bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. In this investigation, we analyzed the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. Serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. These samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. Gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml), and F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against H. influenzae (MIC = 0.03 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml). Moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), H. influenzae (MIC = 0.015 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.06 micro g/ml), F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC =0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml). The results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Acid-neutralizing activity during amino acid fermentation by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Acid-neutralizing activity during amino acid fermentation by washed cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum was studied. When the washed cells of these strains were anaerobically incubated in the presence of aspartylaspartic acid or glutamylglutamic acid for P. gingivalis, aspartic acid for P. intermedia and glutamic acid for F. nucleatum at an initial pH of 5.0 or 5.5, the pH of the incubation mixtures rose toward neutral. F. nucleatum had the highest acid-neutralizing activity, followed by P. intermedia and P. gingivalis. The P. intermedia and F. nucleatum cells were used to measure the amounts of base produced at a fixed pH of 5.0. These cells generated significant amounts of base at pH 5.0 along with the production of organic acids and ammonia from aspartic or glutamic acid. Acid-base balance theoretically calculated from the amounts of consumed substrate and end products implies that the acid-neutralizing activity was derived from the decrease in acidity during the fermentation of amino acid into organic acids and ammonia.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum impairs serum binding to Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm.
AB  - Mouse immune sera obtained by immunization with Fusobacterium nucleatum and then  Porphyromonas gingivalis demonstrated an impaired binding capacity to P. gingivalis-biofilm and lower avidity to P. gingivalis when compared with sera obtained from mice immunized with P. gingivalis alone.
TI  - Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter rectus share a common antigen.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antigens with immunological cross-reactivity in periodontopathogenic bacteria and Helicobacter pylori, the pathogen associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers in human. MATERIALS AND METHODS/RESULTS: Among the putative periodontopathogens tested (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola), cross-reactive bands were only detected in C. rectus by SDS-PAGE/Western immunoblotting analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed to H. pylori cells. One of these cross-reactive antigens, a 64-kDa band antigen, also reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed to the human heat shock protein (HSP) 60. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this C. rectus protein revealed a high degree of homology with corresponding regions of other HSPs belonging to the HSP60 family, indicating that the 64-kDa antigen was a GroEL protein. The nucleotide sequence of the C. rectus GroEL protein coded for a 547 amino acid protein with a predicted size of 57.8 kDa. Comparison of the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of the GroEL protein of C. rectus with that of H. pylori showed a high degree of similarity throughout its length (76.8%). GroEL protein from C. rectus possessed the ability to stimulate production of IL-6 by a confluent monolayer of human gingival epithelial cells and was cytotoxic when used at a high concentration. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals an immunological relationship between H. pylori and C. rectus, and clearly indicates that one of the shared antigens is a GroEL protein possessing a biological activity that might play a role in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Serum antibodies of periodontitis patients compared to the lipopolysaccharides of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Serum antibody titers against the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were compared between 9 periodontitis patients and 24 healthy persons. The IgG titers against the LPSs of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277(T) and W50 were clearly higher in the patients than in the healthy persons. However, IgM titers against the LPSs of P. gingivalis strains were relatively low, and no significant difference was observed between the patients and healthy persons. On the other hand, IgG and IgM titers against the LPS of Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM 8532(T) in some patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy persons, although the difference in IgG titers was not large compared to that of the LPS of P. gingivalis. These results suggest that the antibody measurement of patients' sera against the LPS of periodontal bacteria can be applied for the diagnosis of periodontitis.
TI  - The reduction of Fusobacterium nucleatum in mice is irrelevant to the nitric oxide induced by iNOS.
AB  - Previously we reported that mice infected recurrently with live Fusobacterim nucleatum (Fn) synthesize a significant amount of NO between 12 hr and 24 hr after the Fn injection. We now investigated whether the NO has the capability of killing Fn, a gram-negative rod periodontal pathogen. The mice were divided into three groups: treated with live bacteria (LB), treated with heat-killed bacteria (HKB) and untreated: normal (N). The Fn reduction, NO production and cell number after Fn injection were then compared in these mice. In the LB group, no Fn was detected at 6 hr, whereas it was still detected in the HKB and N groups at 24 hr as assessed by both colony counts and PCR assays. A significant amount of NO was synthesized in the LB group at 24 hr after the Fn injection. Fn is not killed by SNAP-generated NO in vitro. An increase in the total cell number was accompanied by an increase of the neutrophil numbers in the LB group. Intracellular O2(-) generation (including ONOO(-)) was visualized using dihydrorhodamine (DHR)-123. The peak of O2(-) generation by PEC was shown to be at 3 hr in all 3 groups. The number of O2(-) positive cells in the LB group at 3 hr was remarkably high, and most of them were likely to be neutrophils. The Fn reduction would be performed cooperatively via oxygen dependent and oxygen independent mechanisms. Thus reactive oxygen species (ROS) included in the oxygen dependent mechanism appear to be important for Fn reduction. However the significant amounts of NO derived from the iNOS synthesized in the LB group between 12 hr and 24 hr after injection of LFn were not involved in the Fn reduction.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of different laser wavelengths on periodontopathic germs in  photodynamic therapy.
AB  - This study was an attempt to clarify whether the bactericidal effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) are wavelength or dose-dependent. We also attempted to create an optimised protocol for a light-based bactericidal modality to eliminate periodontal pathogens. Cultures of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus sanguis, were exposed to a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) with a 30 mW power output, a 100 mW diode laser at 665 nm, or a 100 mW diode laser at 830 nm, in the presence or absence of methylene blue (MB) as a photosensitiser. A control group was also used with exposure to MB alone without laser exposure. The cultures were analysed by viable counts. The results indicated that exposure to the 100 mW laser light could eliminate up to 40% of bacteria on average. In particular, the most effective killing occurred with exposure to laser light in combination with the MB photosensitiser. The results of kinetic studies indicated that the best PDT response rate was achieved with a 60 s (energy density 21.2 J/cm(2)) exposure to the 665 nm wavelength diode laser in the presence photosensitiser. In this condition, approximately 95% of A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, and 99-100% of the black-pigmented bacteria ( P. gingivalis and P. intermedia) and S. sanguis were eliminated. These results showed that both wavelength and energy density are important factors, and that a low power laser of optimal wavelength and dosage, in combination with an appropriate photosensitiser, is a practical bactericidal modality. We concluded that using a diode laser of proper power and wavelength to deliver 60 s of irradiation could be a useful adjunct with mechanical debridement in the prevention of the re-colonisation of subgingival lesions by pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Mass transport of macromolecules within an in vitro model of supragingival plaque.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of macromolecules through an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque. Polyspecies biofilms containing Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans were formed on sintered hydroxyapatite disks and then incubated at room temperature for defined periods with fluorescent markers with molecular weights ranging from 3,000 to 900,000. Subsequent examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mean square penetration depths for all tested macromolecules except immunoglobulin M increased linearly with time, diffusion coefficients being linearly proportional to the cube roots of the molecular weights of the probes (range, 10,000 to 240,000). Compared to diffusion in bulk water, diffusion in the biofilms was markedly slower. The rate of diffusion for each probe appeared to be constant and not a function of biofilm depth. Analysis of diffusion phenomena through the biofilms suggested tortuosity as the most probable explanation for retarded diffusion. Selective binding of probes to receptors present in the biofilms could not explain the observed extent of retardation of diffusion. These results are relevant to oral health, as selective attenuated diffusion of fermentable carbohydrates and acids produced within dental plaque is thought to be essential for the development of carious lesions.
TI  - Faropenem, a new oral penem: antibacterial activity against selected anaerobic and fastidious periodontal isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of faropenem, an oral penem, was compared with those of penicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole against 106 isolates of anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections. The organisms tested comprised Porphyromonas gingivalis (29), Prevotella spp. (eight), Prevotella melaninogenica (seven), Prevotella intermedia (five), Actinomyces spp. (25), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14), Peptostreptococcus spp. (11), Bacteroides ureolyticus (five) and Bacteroides forsythus (two). The antimicrobial properties of faropenem were investigated by studying MICs, MBCs, time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE). Faropenem was highly active against all the anaerobes tested (MIC(90) < or = 0.5 mg/L) and was bactericidal against both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative anaerobes, with a maximum bactericidal effect at 10 x MIC at between 12 and 24 h. In addition, faropenem had an in vitro PAE on all the tested isolates and this was not influenced by beta-lactamase production. Faropenem may be useful for treating infections caused by periodontal bacteria or oral flora.
TI  - [The influence of two implant materials on the growth of three subgingival predominant bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy as dental implants have  show impressive clinical results. Despite the high success rates, some implants do fail. Compared to those studies on osseointegration of implants, the information pertaining to their failure is little. Further studies on the relationship between implant material and micro-organism are needed. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effect of two commonly used implant materials Titanium (TA2) and Ti-6AI-4V alloy (TC4) on the growth behaviour of three subgingival predominant bacteria Streptococcus sanguis (S. s), Porphyromanus gingivalis (P. g), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n) and their mixture. METHODS: Under anaerobic condition, bacterial suspensions of S.s, P.g, F.n and their mixture were incubated together with the two implant materials respectively, setting the same bacterial suspensions as controls. After 2, 7 and 14 days, the bacterial growth amount was assayed by means of clone forming unit (CFU) method. The pH value of the bacterial suspension was determined by pH-Meter. RESULTS: The results showed that there was no difference in amount of bacterial growth or pH value between TA2 group and TC4 group (P > 0.05). There was also no statistically significant change as to the proportion of individual bacteria in bacterial mixture or the pH value of culture suspension. CONCLUSION: Under the condition of this investigation, the two studies implant materials have no examined influences on the growth of the subgingival bacteria and the pH value of their culture environment.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of resinous retrograde root filling materials.
AB  - The effect of three resinous retrograde root filling materials on the growth of four obligate anaerobic bacteria associated with endodontic infections was determined by using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. Samples of the following resinous materials (resin-modified, glass-ionomer cement, Fuji II LC; compomer, Dyract; and composite resin, Spectrum) were incubated for 1 week with the following anaerobic bacteria: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, and Prevotella intermedia. The freshly mixed and set resinous materials were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms for 1 week. After the end of the incubation period, the zone of growth inhibition was observed and measured. Analysis of variance of the mean diameter of the zone of inhibition indicated no statistically significant overall differences in the response of the black-pigmented Bacteroides species (p > 0.05). For F. nucleatum, Spectrum had more antibacterial effect against this bacteria than Dyract (p < 0.05). Additionally, Fuji II LC was ineffective against F. nucleatum (p < 0.05). However, positive control plates showed bacterial growth in all cases. Our data suggest that the antibacterial potency of polymerized materials varied considerably, depending on the type and the product tested.
TI  - A new method for rapid screening of bacterial species- or subspecies-specific DNA probes.
AB  - A simple assay for the rapid screening of bacterial species- or subspecies-specific DNA probes for the random cloning method is presented, involving the use of genomic DNAs as probes and recombinant plasmid DNAs containing genomic DNA digested with HindIII as targets. The optimal amount of target DNAs and the concentration of digoxigenin-labeled genomic DNA probes were 20 ng and 100 ng ml(-1) (or 10 ng and 200 ng ml(-1)), respectively. The method was applied to the development of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies-specific probes. Our results showed that four out of 96 probes were F. nucleatum subspecies-specific, which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Our results indicate that the new method can be used for the rapid screening of species- or subspecies-specific probes.
TI  - The microflora recovered from the outer-surfaces of the Frialit-2 implanto-prosthetic connector.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of Frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. In 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 Frialit-2 implants. The functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. After removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the Frialit-2 prosthetic connector. The microbial plaque samples were specified on CDC-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on TSBV-agar in CFU/ml. The microbial plaque samples were dominated by Actinomyces israelii (68.8%), Eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and Veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (V. parvula) and 11.1% (A. israelii). The most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were Fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and Peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for P. gingivalis (11.4%) and P. micros (11.4%). No statistical significant correlation could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the F2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. The outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of Frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. After 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.
TI  - Isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (Ig)A could be more protective than IgG and that there could be a relationship between crevicular fluid-specific IgA levels and the onset of periodontal disease. This study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. METHODS: Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). Antigens were extracted from Actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests to assess IgA and IgG levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. RESULTS: The crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of IgG to the 4 microorganisms tested than that of controls (P < 10(-6) for all comparisons). IgA levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (P < 10(-7) for all comparisons). Controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary IgA than patients (P < 0.02 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the potentially protective role of specific IgA directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.
TI  - IgG subclass specific antibody response to periodontopathic organisms in HIV-positive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported an increased rate of progression of periodontal disease over an 18-month period in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects compared to controls. The mechanism for disease progression and rapid tissue loss was unknown. Data on the microbiological studies failed to show any significant difference in the microbial characteristics of the periodontal lesions in HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative controls. Immunological analysis had identified neutrophils as an important component of the host defense against periodontal infection, especially against rapid tissue loss. Serum IgG reactivities to periodontal pathogens in HIV-positive patients with periodontitis were reduced. Other data provided circumstantial evidence to suggest that IgG subclass (IgG2) specific antibody might assist bacterial clearing in periodontal infection. The aim of the current study was to examine the specific IgG subclass antibody response to a panel of periodontopathic organisms: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella Intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), and Bacteroides forsythus (Bf) in HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative controls. METHODS: Sera from 120 HIV-positive patients (40 periodontitis, 69 gingivitis, and 11 no oral diseases) were tested for IgG subclass specific antibody response to the above listed 6 organisms using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were compared with those obtained from 40 HIV-negative control subjects (35 periodontitis, 2 gingivitis, and 3 no oral diseases). RESULTS: In the HIV-positive group, a consistently high response rate was found in IgG1 to all the bacteria tested. In addition, high levels of IgG3 and IgG4 to Pg and IgG1 and IgG2 to Pi were also present. However, no significant difference was detected among the periodontitis, gingivitis, and no oral disease subgroups. When the periodontitis patients from the HIV-positive group were compared to the HIV-negative group, no difference in the antibody levels and response rates was noted. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in HIV-positive patients, the specific IgG subclass antibody response to periodontopathic organisms was similar to that of HIV-negative subjects.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ca(OH)2 dental cements: an in vitro study.
AB  - The effect of five commercial calcium hydroxide root canal medications (XR-SPAD,  Calcicur, Hy-cal, Root-cal, Hypo-cal) and two calcium hydroxide mixtures (with water or glycerin) on the growth of (a) three anaerobic bacteria associated with endodontic infections; and (b) saliva bacterial strains was determined using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. Statistically significant zones of bacterial growth inhibition for all the bacteria tested were observed. Calcium hydroxide mixed with glycerin showed the largest zones of bacterial inhibition, whereas Root-cal was the least active. These results underline the necessity to evaluate the antibacterial potential of endodontic medications against the different bacterial strains commonly isolated from infected root canals.
TI  - [Effect of lipopolysaccharide on recombinant human osteogenic protein-1-induced responses in human dental pulp cells].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on recombinant  human osteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1) induced proliferation and differentiation. METHODS: Measured MTT, alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity and osteocalcin content of human dental pulp cells. RESULTS: Low-dose LPS (1 microgram/ml) caused co-operative effect with low concentration of rhOP-1 to enhance human dental pulp cell proliferation and ALPase activity, but not to osteocalcin, whereas, high-dose LPS (100 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited the proliferation, ALPase activity and osteocalcin with or without rhOP-1. CONCLUSION: The role of LPS in caries-induced reparative dentin might be a significant determinant.
TI  - [The neutralizing effect of histidine-rich-polypeptides on LPS from suspected periodontal pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human parotid histidine-rich-polypeptides (HRPs) are a family of lowmolecular-weight, cationic polypeptides. HRP-1, HRP-3 and HRP-5 comprise 85%-90% of the total HRPs and are called major HRPs. There were many researches indicating the antimicrobial activities of HRPs. Recently, HRPs were reported to have an inhibitory action on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of E. coli, with HRP-5 being the most effective one among the three major HRPs. Since the LPS of oral gram-negative bacteria is thought to be one of the important etiological factors during the development of periodontal diseases, our experiment was aimed to investigate the neutralizing effect of human parotid HRP-5 on the LPS of anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens, which have different chemical structures and biological activities compared with LPS of aerobic E. coli. METHODS: By using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE), HRP-5 was purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults. Two stains of suspected periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g, 47-A) and Fusobacterium nuceatum (F. n, separated from subgingival plaque of a patient with adult periodontitis) were mass cultured. After harvested in the midlogarithmic phase, they were washed and lyophilized. The LPS of dried bacteria were extracted by the modified Westphal hot phenol-water procedures and purified by the enzyme digestion plus ultracentrifugation. Limulus test was applied to test the neutralizing effect of HRP-5 on the LPS-induced gelation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate. In brief, the standard LPS of E. coli, or extracted LPS of P. g or F. n, was preincubated with HRP-5 in a tube separately in room temperature for 10 minutes. Then the reagent of Limulus amoebocyte lysate was added in all the tubes, continued the incubation in 37 degrees C for one hour. After that, the gelation level of every tube was observed. RESULTS: LPS extracted from P. g and F. n both showed good purity and strong activities to induce gelation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate. The gelation induced by LPS (1 ng/ml) of these two anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens were weakly inhibited by HRP-5 (10 micrograms/ml), similar to that observed with standard LPS of E. coli. To get a complete neutralizing effect on LPS, it may be important to increase the concentration of HRP-5. CONCLUSION: It appeared that HRPs could neutralize the endotoxic properties of LPS of suspected periodontal pathogens, therefore may contribute to periodontal health. The present investigation further confirmed that HRPs are important components of the host non-immune defense system.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of new-quinolone and macrolide antibiotics against oral bacteria].
AB  - Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 4 new-quinolone antibacterial reagents  and 4 macrolide antibiotics against periodontopathic bacteria 21 species 24 strains of standard strains including oral related bacteria and clinical isolated (1993-1999) 20 strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, 7 strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were determined. Minocycline HCl was used as the comparative reagent. Macrolide showed moderate antibacterial activity against standard strains of oral related bacteria except Fusobacterium nucleatum. New-quinolone showed excellent activity against Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Concerning to the clinical isolated strains, Clarithromycin effected P. gingivalis (MIC90 0.1 microgram/ml) and Levofloxacin and Ciprofloxacin showed high-potency antibacterial activity against clinical isolated Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC90 0.013-0.025 microgram/ml).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of magainin analogues against anaerobic oral pathogens.
AB  - Magainins are a family of potent antimicrobial cationic peptides that possess antimicrobial activity against a wide range of target organisms. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of synthetic magainin-mimetic compounds MSI-751 and MSI-774 was investigated against the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella intermedia. P. gingivalis was more susceptible to MSI-751 than to MSI-774, whereas the other oral pathogens showed little difference in susceptibility to the two compounds. MSI-751 exhibited a rapid, dose-dependent bactericidal effect on P. gingivalis. Electron microscopy of MSI-751-treated P. gingivalis revealed intact cell wall vesicles devoid of cell contents, suggesting perturbation of the cytoplasmic membrane by this compound, perhaps equivalent to formation of membrane-disruptive ion channels by magainin peptides. These studies demonstrate that synthetic magainin derivatives exhibit antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens by disruption of cell membrane integrity.
TI  - Emergence of penicillin resistance among Fusobacterium nucleatum populations of commensal oral flora during early childhood.
AB  - Penicillin resistance due to beta-lactamase production is surprisingly common among oral bacteria in childhood. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobic bacillus, is a member of the developing oral commensal flora. As part of the investigation on the emergence of oral bacterial resistance, the aim of the present study was to examine longitudinally the penicillin resistance among salivary F. nucleatum populations as related to age, day care attendance and sibling history, and exposure to antimicrobial agents. Altogether 1492 F. nucleatum isolates from saliva of 44 healthy infants followed at a study clinic at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age were tested for beta-lactamase production. Furthermore, the 276 beta-lactamase-positive isolates were examined for their in vitro susceptibility to penicillin G by the NCCLS-approved agar dilution method. Statistical analysis of the associations between penicillin-resistant isolates and infants' age, day care attendance, number of siblings and their ear infections, and exposure to antimicrobial agents was performed by SPSS Windows Version 10. The prevalence of infants harbouring beta-lactamase-producing F. nucleatum strains increased from 2% to 49% during the follow-up time. In nearly all cases beta-lactamase-producing F. nucleatum isolates were found simultaneously with beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Most beta-lactamase-producing isolates (80%) showed an MIC of > or =8 mg/L. In conclusion, the prevalence of infants harbouring penicillin-resistant F. nucleatum due to beta-lactamase production increased with age and usage of antimicrobial agents during the first year of life.
TI  - Clonality of Fusobacterium nucleatum in root canal infections.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative non-spore-forming, non-motile, obligate anaerobic rod that is normally isolated from the oral cavity. Several studies have reported a significant heterogeneity within the F. nucleatum species. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clonal diversity of F. nucleatum strains isolated from intracanal infections and to evaluate the presence of Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-like sequences in the genome of F. nucleatum. Samples were collected from 13 single-root teeth from adult patients, all having carious lesions, necrotic pulps and radiographic evidence of periradicular bone loss. F. nucleatum was isolated from two different patients (subjects 5 and 7) by culture. Amplification of 19 colonies from subject 5 and 15 colonies from subject 7 using ERIC primers resulted in four clonal types, two per subject. An intense amplicon of approximately 700 bp was generated by ERIC-PCR for all F. nucleatum isolates and F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum ATCC 10953. The amplification reaction using primer 1254 confirmed the results obtained with the ERIC primer. Our findings indicate that DNA fingerprints provided by ERIC- and Arbitrarily Primed (AP)-PCR may constitute a powerful tool for investigating F. nucleatum clonal diversity.
TI  - Similarity of the oral microbiota of pre-school children with that of their caregivers in a population-based study.
AB  - This study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. Oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in Saipan were assayed using a DNA probe assay. Many species including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces species, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas Bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. A higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. There were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. By logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. In conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. The microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.
TI  - Cytokine production in response to endodontic infection in germ-free mice.
AB  - This study evaluated the cytokine profiles (type 1 or type 2) that are triggered  by and modulate endodontic periapical infections in the root canal system of germ-free mice. Microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated into two groups of experimental animals: group I (Gemella morbillorum) and group II (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium butyricum). In vitro, G. morbillorum induced type 1 cytokine synthesis, while the modulation processed in vivo seemed to have the opposite effect, with a reduction in the basal levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma, IL-4-independent down-modulation. In vitro, microorganisms from group II, in poly-infection, induced a reduction of type 1 cytokine levels from day 10 to day 20, which seemed to be modulated via IL-4. In vivo, however, a predominance of the immune response to one species over the others occurred.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.

TI  - In vitro effect of laser irradiation on cementum-bound endotoxin isolated from periodontally diseased roots.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of an Nd:YAG laser on periodontal disease by measuring crevicular interleukin (IL)-1beta levels before and after laser application. It was found that laser therapy was less effective than traditional scaling and root planing. These results might be due to incomplete removal of microbial residues and cementum-bound endotoxin on root surfaces by the laser. In this study, we explored the in vitro effectiveness of an Nd:YAG laser for the elimination of cementum-bound endotoxin by measuring IL-1beta changes in stimulated monocytes. METHODS: Fresh human monocytes were harvested from adults without periodontitis and grown in RPMI 1640 medium. Diseased cementum particles were collected and prepared from teeth with untreated periodontitis and were irradiated with 5 levels of laser energy. Cementum particles were subjected to endotoxin testing by a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and then were incubated with cultured monocytes. Production of IL-1beta in stimulated monocytes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantified by spectrophotometry. RESULTS: The endotoxin unit (EU) of diseased cementum was 18.4 EU/mg, which seemed to be remarkably lower than that of common periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (381) at 15,300 EU/mg/ml, Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25611) at 227 EU/mg/ml, and Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 25586) at 1,987 EU/mg/ml. Monocytes subjected to stimulation by diseased cementum particles without laser irradiation produced 124 to 145 pg/ml IL-1beta, 9- to 18-fold higher than that of unstimulated monocytes (7.07 to 15.95 pg/ml). Diseased cementum particles after irradiation with various energy levels of the Nd:YAG laser could still stimulate monocytes to secrete 89 to 129 pg/ml IL-1beta. No statistically significant difference was found in the production of IL-1beta induced by diseased-bound cementum with or without laser irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: The Nd:YAG laser varying from 50 mJ, 10 pps to 150 mJ, 20 pps, for 2 minutes, did not seem to be effective in destroying diseased cementum endotoxin.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and other putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with and without periodontal destruction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease. It has been suggested that not all bacteria associated with periodontitis may be normal inhabitants of a periodontally healthy dentition. In particular, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been isolated infrequently from subjects without periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to compare prevalence and proportions of a number of periodontal bacteria in periodontitis patients and control subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In all, 116 consecutive subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age 42.4) and 94 subjects without radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss (mean age 40.4) were recruited for the study. The gingival condition in the control group varied between gingival health and various degrees of gingivitis. In patients, the deepest pocket in each quadrant was selected for microbiological sampling. In control subjects all mesial and distal sites of all first molars were selected for sampling. All paper points from a patient were pooled and processed for anaerobic cultivation within 6 h after sampling. Clinical variables of sampled sites included bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more often prevalent in patients than in controls. The highest odds ratios were found for P. gingivalis and B. forsythus (12.3 and 10.4 resp.). Other odds ratios varied from 3.1 to 7.7 for A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. micros, respectively. Absolute numbers of target bacteria were all higher in patients, but only the mean percentage of B. forsythus was significantly higher in patients in comparison to controls (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, F. nucleatum and P. micros are all significant markers for destructive periodontal disease in adult subjects. Based on calculated odds ratios, B. forsythus and P. gingivalis are the strongest bacterial markers for this disease and are infrequently cultured from subjects without periodontal bone loss.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against periodontal anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of penicillin G, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, erythromycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 158 isolates associated with periodontal infections. MIC(50)/MIC(90) values of moxifloxacin were respectively 0.06/0.5 mg/l for Porphyromonas gingivalis (35), for Prevotella spp. (28) and Actinomyces spp. (35), 0.12/0.25 mg/l for Fusobacterium nucleatum (20) and 0.06/0.12 mg/l for Peptostreptococcus spp. (30). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of moxifloxacin for Bacteroides forsythus (6) and Campylobacter rectus (4) was 0.06-0.12 mg/l. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were equal to or 2-4 times the MIC values. Moxifloxacin produced a bactericidal effect at 8 h. Our results show that moxifloxacin has good antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens comparable with that of cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate, and better than that of clindamycin, metronidazole and penicillin.
TI  - Structural characterization of the fusobacterial non-specific porin FomA suggests a 14-stranded topology, unlike the classical porins.
AB  - Native and recombinant FomA proteins were extracted by detergent from the cell envelopes of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli, and purified to near homogeneity by chromatography. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that the FomA protein consists predominantly of beta-sheets, in line with the previously proposed 16-stranded beta-barrel topology model. Results obtained by trypsin treatment of intact cells and cell envelopes of F. nucleatum, and from limited proteolysis of purified FomA protein, indicated that the N-terminal part of the FomA protein is not an integral part of the beta-barrel, but forms a periplasmic domain. Based on these results a new topology model is proposed for the FomA protein, where the C-terminal part forms a 14-stranded beta-barrel separate from the periplasmic N-terminal domain.
TI  - Phenolic antibacterials from Piper betle in the prevention of halitosis.
AB  - Piper betle L. (Piperaceae) leaves which are traditionally used in India and China in the prevention of oral malodor was examined by bioassay-guided fractionation to yield allylpyrocatechol (APC) as the major active principle which showed promising activity against obligate oral anaerobes responsible for halitosis. The biological studies with APC indicated that the potential to reduce methylmercaptan and hydrogen sulfide was mainly due to the anti-microbial activity as established using dynamic in vitro models.
TI  - Effect of IL-1ra on human dental pulp cells and pulpal inflammation.
AB  - AIM: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) on the LPS-induced interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) synthesis in human dental pulp cells and to assess the role of IL-1ra in pulpal inflammation. METHODS: IL-1beta from human dental pulp cells (HDP) was measured by sandwich ELISA; IL-1ra expression in pulpal tissue was detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Stimulation of HDP with increasing concentrations of FnLPS resulted in dose-dependent IL-1beta production. The addition of IL-1ra reduced FnLPS-induced IL-1beta synthesis in human dental pulp cells. Significant inhibition of the FnLPS-induced IL-1beta synthesis was observed when IL-1ra was added before treating with FnLPS for 60 min. Large numbers of IL-1ra positive neutrophils, plasmacytes, endothelial cells and lymphocytes were observed in inflamed pulp tissue. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1ra could reduce LPS-stimulated IL-1beta synthesis, suggesting that IL-1ra may play a role in pulpitis.
TI  - Fusobacterium osteomyelitis in a child with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Children who have sickle cell disease are at increased risk for osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. We report a case of anaerobic osteomyelitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in a child with sickle cell disease. The infection did not resolve with antibiotic therapy alone, but was cured after surgical debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
TI  - Growth pH and transient increases in amino acid availability influence polyglucose synthesis by Fusobacterium nucleatum grown in continuous culture.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe that has been implicated in the aetiology of several diseases including periodontal diseases. Like other fusobacteria, it derives energy from the fermentation of amino acids and, in resting (non-growing) cells, this enables the organism to transport glucose and synthesise intracellular polyglucose (IP). The continued availability and fermentation of amino acids inhibits IP breakdown. We have grown F. nucleatum in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium under amino acid limitation and determined the fate of glucose during growth at steady state and during transient increases in the concentration (pulses) of serine and glutamate. When grown under steady state conditions, IP synthesis dramatically increased at culture pH values of 6.1 and 7.8 and appeared to be a result of cell stress. IP synthesis also increased when the culture was pulsed with serine or glutamate but was rapidly metabolised as the added amino acids were depleted. These results may help to explain the role of IP synthesis in response to environmental stress.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from a glossal abscess in an adolescent.
AB  - Glossal abscess is infrequent in children. Anaerobic bacteria are rarely recovered from this infection and never have been reported in children or adolescents. A 15-year-old patient presented with a tongue abscess following trauma. Aspirate of the abscess yielded polymicrobial anaerobic flora: Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros. The patient recovered following incision and drainage and 14 days of antimicrobial therapy with clindamycin. This report illustrates the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from glossal abscess in an adolescent.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the L-cysteine desulfhydrase gene of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are the two major compounds associated with oral malodor. These compounds are highly toxic, and are thought to play an important role in periodontal disease. Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral bacterium, produces large amounts of hydrogen sulfide from L-cysteine by the enzymatic action of L-cysteine desulfhydrase. We cloned and sequenced the cdl gene encoding L-cysteine desulfhydrase from F. nucleatum ATCC 10953, and revealed that the structural cdl gene consists of 921 bp and encodes a 33.4-kDa protein. The cloned gene was inserted into an expression vector, pDEST17, and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fused protein. The purified enzyme was tested for substrate specificity using various SH-containing compounds. Only L-cysteine served as a substrate for L-cysteine desulfhydrase to produce hydrogen sulfide.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - Sequence conservation and distribution of the fusobacterial immunosuppressive protein gene, fipA.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe involved in various diseases, including periodontitis. Recently, other investigators isolated the F. nucleatum FDC 364 fusobacterial immunosuppressive protein (FIP). One subunit, FipA, impairs T-cell activation in vitro and shows homology with beta-ketothiolases. However, its distribution and variability among fusobacteria was not reported. Cloned fipA gene sequences from F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum (ATCC 10953) and F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (ATCC 23726) shared 89 and 92% identity, respectively, with FDC 364 fipA, and 90 and 94% identity, respectively, with the FDC 364 FipA predicted amino acid sequence. Southern blot analyses of chromosomal DNA from fusobacterial strains, including F. nucleatum and other Fusobacterium species, were performed using partial fipA sequences as probes. The results indicate that fipA is highly conserved among the F. nucleatum strains examined and that fipA homologues are widely distributed among fusobacteria. A clear relationship between immune suppression, metabolism and the FipA protein remains to be determined.
TI  - Activity of endodontic antibacterial agents against selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of substances used as antibacterial agents (solutions  of 10% calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol - PMCC, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate and 10% castor oil plant detergent) on anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 33563, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 and Bacteroidesfragilis ATCC 25285), using a broth dilution technique, was evaluated in vitro. For determination of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations (MIC and MBC), two culture broths, Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM) and supplemented Brucella, standardized inoculum and serially diluted solutions were used. All antibacterial agents presented antimicrobial activity that varied for different bacteria. There were no differences in the performance of the two broths. Chlorhexidine digluconate was the most effective, with the lowest MICs, followed by castor oil detergent, PMCC and calcium hydroxide. C. perfringens and B. fragilis were the most resistant bacteria to all agents.
TI  - [Microbiological validation of the choice of basic plastic for removable dentures].
AB  - Adhesion of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria, favoring the development of oral inflammatory diseases, including the cariesogenic and periodontogenic bacteria and Candida albicans fungi, isolated from patients with periodontitis, to 13 basic materials used in removable denture making, was studied. The adhesion of all bacteria (Streptococcus sanguis, Prevotella melangogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Corynebacterium xerosis) and fungi to hot polymerization basic materials was the maximum. The most perspective basic plastic for clinical use (preserving intact oral microbiocenosis and preventing stomatitis induced by denture wearing) are cold polymerization materials, such as Redont-03, Dentoplast Breden, Leocryl, and UHF polymerization materials Acron GC, AKR-MV, and Etakril-02.
TI  - PCR-based identification of bacteria associated with endodontic infections.
AB  - PCR primers that target the bacterial 16S rRNA genes (or the tuf gene for the genus Enterococcus) were used to identify 10 putative bacterial pathogens in root canals with necrotic pulp. In addition, the associations of these microorganisms with symptoms and a history of diabetes mellitus were investigated. Microbial samples from the root canals of 24 teeth with necrotic pulp were included in the study. PCR with universal bacterial primers identified bacterial DNA in 22 specimens; the remaining 2 specimens were from intact teeth that had been traumatized 6 months prior to treatment. PCR with specific primers showed that preoperative symptoms were significantly associated with the presence of Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001 by chi-square analysis). There was also a nonsignificant trend for symptoms to be associated with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis (odds ratio, >2) and for diabetes mellitus to be associated with P. gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis (odds ratio, >2). Cloning and sequencing of the universal PCR product in one specimen revealed the presence of an organism related to the genus Olsenella, which has not previously been described in endodontic infections.
TI  - Microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  - The microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases, associated with hematological disorders'. Examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (DQB1) and serotypes (DR locus) of HLA class II antigens. Phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted. The subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by Gram-negative rods, especially Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by Gram-positive cocci and Gram-positive rods. Through the use of polymerase chain reaction, Campylobacter rectus and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. intermedia, and Treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. All three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. Each subject had the same genotype, HLA-DQB1*0601, while the mother had HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR8, and the son and daughter had HLA-DR2 only. In summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. It is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and  proteomics: a new era in anaerobic microbiology.
AB  - Genome sequence data provide a framework for predicting potential microbial activities; however, the proteome content of the cell dictates its response to its environment. Microbiology is witnessing a major initiative to elucidate the nature of the proteome of large numbers of species. The tool driving the proteomic revolution is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. During the analysis process, proteins are ionized and separated on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratios, which results in a characteristic mass-spectral profile. Because of the dynamic nature of the cell and the large number of external parameters that could influence its mass-spectral profile, considerable work was needed initially to optimize sample analysis and obtain consistent and reproducible results. For many anaerobes that grow poorly or are nonreactive in most diagnostic systems, proteome analysis is likely to have a major impact on microbial diagnosis and the delineation of centers of diversity associated with infections.
TI  - Update on the taxonomy and clinical aspects of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  - The genus Fusobacterium currently includes 13 species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most frequently encountered species in humans, is heterogeneous and currently includes 5 subspecies. A potentially new subspecies of F. nucleatum that is intrinsically quinolone-resistant and phylogenetically separate from the other 5 subspecies has been identified from dog and cat oral flora. Two subspecies have been described for Fusobacterium necrophorum, and a new species, Fusobacterium equinum, which is related to F. necrophorum, has been described from horse oral flora. Additional molecular studies have characterized Fusobacterium ulcerans as separate from the phenotypically similar Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium. Fusobacterium sulci and Fusobacterium alocis have been reclassified as Eubacterium sulci and Filifactor alocis, respectively. Fusobacterium prausnitzii is phylogenetically related to the Eubacterium-like organisms and will likely be reclassified in the future. The status of the remaining species is unchanged.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - Contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens.
AB  - Experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. Of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. In this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. In ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. Subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. The interdental brush samples and the samples of the subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. The results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. On the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. The total anaerobic colony-forming units (CFU), P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and E. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (P<0.005). These results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. This contamination could be a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.
TI  - Regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis and transport genes in bacteria by transcriptional and translational attenuation.
AB  - The riboflavin biosynthesis in bacteria was analyzed using comparative analysis of genes, operons and regulatory elements. A model for regulation based on formation of alternative RNA structures involving the RFN elements is suggested. In Gram-positive bacteria including actinomycetes, Thermotoga, Thermus and Deinococcus, the riboflavin metabolism and transport genes are predicted to be regulated by transcriptional attenuation, whereas in most Gram-negative bacteria, the riboflavin biosynthesis genes seem to be regulated on the level of translation initiation. Several new candidate riboflavin transporters were identified (impX in Desulfitobacterium halfniense and Fusobacterium nucleatum; pnuX in several actinomycetes, including some Corynebacterium species and Strepto myces coelicolor; rfnT in Rhizobiaceae). Traces of a number of likely horizontal transfer events were found: the complete riboflavin operon with the upstream regulatory element was transferred to Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from some Gram-positive bacterium; non-regulated riboflavin operon in Pyrococcus furiousus was likely transferred from Thermotoga; and the RFN element was inserted into the riboflavin operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from some other Pseudomonas species, where it had regulated the ribH2 gene.
TI  - 3-Chloro-DL-alanine resistance by L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  - The antibacterial agent 3-chloro-DL-alanine (3CA) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mM 3CA, whereas Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. We isolated the 3CA resistance gene from F. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of L-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. The enzyme also exhibits 3CA chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. This antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
TI  - Influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  - The influence of secondary colonizers (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs coated with Streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3H-labeled bacterial cell suspension of F. nucleatum or A. naeslundii and then in a 14C-labeled P. gingivalis cell suspension. Bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. The cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of P. gingivalis. These two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of P. gingivalis. Human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of P. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to S. sanguis-coated HAP discs. Adherence of P. gingivalis and A. naeslundii was strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of F. nucleatum was affected the least. Treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of P. gingivalis. The rate of decrease was much smaller in F. nucleatum. These results indicate that both F. nucleatum and A. naeslundii enhance the adherence of P. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of P. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.
TI  - Tales of the unexpected.
AB  
TI  - Possible association between amniotic fluid micro-organism infection and microflora in the mouth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral bacteria are found in the amniotic cavity. DESIGN: Laboratory based analysis of clinical samples. SETTING: Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel. POPULATION: Forty-eight women attending for elective caesarean section. METHODS: Dental plaque, a high vaginal swab, amniotic fluid and chorioamnion tissue were taken from women with intact membranes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Samples were investigated using culture and microscopy for the presence of microorganisms. Amniotic fluid was analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the ubiquitous 16S rRNA gene specific to most eubacteria. Samples were analysed using PCR genus and species specific primers directed to bacterial taxa found as part of the normal oral microflora (Streptococcus spp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum). Levels of prostaglandin E2 and cytokines were measured in amniotic fluid. RESULTS: Amniotic fluid was positive for universal bacteria PCR, Streptococcus spp. PCR and F. nucleatum PCR in 34/48, 20/48 and 7/48 of cases, respectively. Streptococcus spp. and F. nucleatum were cultured from the dental plaque, vagina and amniotic fluid of 48/48, 14/48, 0/48 and 29/48, 6/48, 0/48 subjects, respectively. A significant association was found between detection of microbial DNA (universal and F. nucletum) and complications in previous pregnancies including miscarriage, intrauterine death, neonatal death, preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Prostaglandin E2 and cytokine levels, with the exception of IL-1alpha, were not significantly different between women with and without evidence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Streptococcus spp. and F. nucleatum in the amniotic fluid may have an oral origin.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Direct amplification of rRNA gene sequences for identification of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections and their relationship with symptoms using a highly sensitive technique, the polymerase chain reaction. METHODOLOGY: Samples were obtained from 91 infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions, including cases of acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted from the samples and analysed for the presence of target microbial species using a PCR-based identification assay. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria. Streptococcus anginosus group was detected in 16.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum in 14.3%, and Bacteroides forsythus in 7.1% of the abscess samples. No pus sample yielded Actinomyces israelii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fungal species. In general, B. forsythus was found in 20% of the cases (16 of 80), S. anginosus in 12% (6 of 50), F. nucleatum in 10% (6 of 60) and A. israelii in 5% (two of 40). A. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any case. Fungi were present in only one of 50 cases (2%). There was no correlation between the species and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Direct molecular approaches appear to be a valuable tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as for research purposes. There was no correlation between target microbial species and symptoms.
TI  - [Clinical and laboratory studies of bacterial adhesion to validate the choice of  material for making provisional dentures for patients with periodontal diseases].
AB  - Adhesion of bacteria favoring the development of oral inflammations, including cariesogenic and periodontopathogenic (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcommitans, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus warneri) and yeast fungi (Candida albicans), to 13 materials used for making provisional dentures was studied. Adhesion of all the studied bacteria and fungi to Russian material Esterfil Foto was the minimum. Clinical use of this material in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis showed that it was well tolerated and the treatment led to improvement of oral microbiocenosis.
TI  - Effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  - Antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. Previous studies suggested that 1 mM NaF reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. The present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mM, 10 ppm NaF) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. Nine oral species were grown at pH 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the pH for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of NaF. In addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without NaF, and the pH change followed by microelectrode. After 10 days, chemostat pH dropped to ca. pH 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by Streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total CFU) and Veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). In comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final pH was significantly higher (ca. pH 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). The culture was predominated by V. dispar (70%) and Actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas S. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. Biofilm pH fell to only pH 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). Analysis of the data suggests that fluoride exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. Fluoride prevents enrichment of S. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.
TI  - Treatment of periodontal disease in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A case report and literature review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) designates a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders characterized by skin elasticity, tissue fragility, and chronic joint pain. Dental findings have been reported with some types of EDS. This case report describes the periodontal findings in a patient with a previously undiagnosed EDS type VIII. METHODS: Diagnostic aids utilized included microbial testing, histological examination, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) analysis for the levels of C-telopeptide pyridinoline cross-links (ICTP), and genetic counseling. Periodontal treatment consisted of mechanical debridement and adjunctive antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Genetic counseling and clinical presentation confirmed the diagnosis of EDS type VIII. Periodontal treatment led to marked clinical improvements and GCF levels of the bone resorptive marker ICTP were significantly reduced. The patient and her siblings are currently pursuing appropriate medical care and genetic counseling. CONCLUSION: Periodontal involvement may lead to the diagnosis of an underlying systemic condition. Identification of suspected etiological factors of periodontal disease may prove critical for the general well-being of some patients.
TI  - Mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  - Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. To investigate the role of MCP-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of MCP-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. In this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. The absence of MCP-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in MCP-1(-/-) mice (P < 0.05). The consequence was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (P < 0.05). We also determined that the MCP-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1. These results point to the importance of MCP-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on PMN recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.
TI  - Parotid salivary S-IgA antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  - Persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory IgA (S-IgA) or parotid S-IgA reactive with selected oral microorganisms. Parotid saliva samples were obtained from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. Output levels of total S-IgA and of specific S-IgA reactive with cell extracts from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of ELISA. Smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total S-IgA, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. Parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific S-IgA at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. The present observations indicate that total S-IgA and bacteria-specific S-IgA in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.
TI  - Enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. Solid phase cytometry (SPC) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. Fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. However, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. We have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium bifermentans, C. butyricum, C. perfringens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas canoris, P. gingivalis, Propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (C. butyricum, C. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. However, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, C. tyrobutyricum. For vegetative cells of all strains, plots of SPC versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that SPC consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of Brazilian subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. The present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis Brazilians using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. METHODS: Twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [PD], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [AL], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean PD, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean AL, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. Measurements of PD, AL, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. The presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard method. RESULTS: Periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (E. faecalis, E. coli and Bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (P < 0.05). Most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, E. nodatum, and F. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean PD and AL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota of Brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.
TI  - Effect of Fusobacterium nucleatum on the T and B cell responses to Porphyromonas  gingivalis in a mouse model.
AB  - T cell cytokine profiles and specific serum antibody levels in five groups of BALB/c mice immunized with saline alone, viable Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, viable Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, F. nucleatum followed by P. gingivalis and P. gingivalis followed by F. nucleatum were determined. Splenic CD4 and CD8 cells were examined for intracytoplasmic interleukin (IL)-4, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-10 by dual colour flow cytometry and the levels of serum anti-F. nucleatum and anti-P. gingivalis antibodies determined by an ELISA. Both Th1 and Th2 responses were demonstrated by all groups, and while there were slightly lower percentages of cytokine positive T cells in mice injected with F. nucleatum alone compared with the other groups immunized with bacteria, F. nucleatum had no effect on the T cell production of cytokines induced by P. gingivalis in the two groups immunized with both organisms. However, the percentages of cytokine positive CD8 cells were generally significantly higher than those of the CD4 cells. Mice immunized with F. nucleatum alone had high levels of serum anti-F. nucleatum antibodies with very low levels of P. gingivalis antibodies, whereas mice injected with P. gingivalis alone produced anti-P. gingivalis antibodies predominantly. Although the levels of anti-F. nucleatum antibodies in mice injected with F. nucleatum followed by P. gingivalis were the same as in mice immunized with F. nucleatum alone, antibody levels to P. gingivalis were very low. In contrast, mice injected with P. gingivalis followed by F. nucleatum produced equal levels of both anti-P. gingivalis and anti-F. nucleatum antibodies, although at lower levels than the other three groups immunized with bacteria, respectively. Anti-Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Prevotella intermedia serum antibody levels were also determined and found to be negligible. In conclusion, F. nucleatum immunization does not affect the splenic T cell cytokine response to P. gingivalis. However, F. nucleatum immunization prior to that of P. gingivalis almost completely inhibited the production of anti-P. gingivalis antibodies while P. gingivalis injection before F. nucleatum demonstrated a partial inhibitory effect by P. gingivalis on antibody production to F. nucleatum. The significance of these results with respect to human periodontal disease is difficult to determine. However, they may explain in part differing responses to P. gingivalis in different individuals who may or may not have had prior exposure to F. nucleatum. Finally, the results suggested that P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum do not induce the production of cross-reactive antibodies to other oral microorganisms.
TI  - Treatment of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Conventional mechanical treatment of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome  periodontitis has a poor prognosis. This report describes an effective antimicrobial treatment of rapidly progressing periodontitis in an 11-year old girl having Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. METHOD: Clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. Occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification. Presence of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr type 1 virus was determined by a nested-PCR detection method. Therapy included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole therapy (250 mg of each/3 times daily/10 days) which, based on follow-up microbiological testing, was repeated after 4 months. Supportive periodontal therapy took place at 2 visits during a 16-month period. RESULTS: At baseline, 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. At 16 months, probing and radiographic measurements revealed no teeth with additional attachment loss, and several teeth exhibited significant reduction in gingivitis and pocket depth, increase in radiographic alveolar bone height and clinical attachment level, and radiographic evidence of crestal lamina dura. Baseline subgingival microbiota included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), Prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), Fusobacteriumnucleatum (14.3%) and Peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%), as well as cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr type 1 virus. At termination of the study, culture and PCR examinations showed absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. micros and herpesviruses, and P. nigrescens and F.nucleatum each comprised less than 0.1 % of subgingival isolates. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that controlling the periodontopathic microbiota by appropriate antibiotic and conventional periodontal therapy can arrest Papillon-Lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
TI  - In vitro effect of intracanal medicaments on strict anaerobes by means of the broth dilution method.
AB  - The determination of bacterial susceptibility to intracanal medicaments is a necessity. Nevertheless, few studies utilize the proper methodology to carry out that evaluation with anaerobes. In this study, the steps of a broth dilution method, carried out in microplates (microdilution) and tubes (macrodilution), to test the effect of traditional intracanal medicaments on anaerobic bacteria are described. The results are presented as values of minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC). Standardized inocula of the anaerobic bacteria Prevotella nigrescens (ATCC 33563), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 25586) and Clostridium perfringens (ATCC 13124), in reinforced Clostridium medium (RCM) and supplemented Brucella broth, were submitted to different concentrations of calcium hydroxide, chlorhexidine digluconate, camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol solutions. The drugs were diluted in the same culture broths, in microplates and tubes, and were then incubated in anaerobiosis jars at 37 degrees C for 48 or 96 hours. The determination of MICs was carried out through visual and spectrophotometric readings, and the determination of MBCs, through the plating of aliquots on RCM-blood agar. For that kind of study, the macromethod with spectrophotometric reading should be the natural choice. MICs and MBCs obtained with the macromethod were compatible with the known clinical performance of the studied medications, and the values varied according to the bacteria and culture media employed. RCM was the most effective medium and C. perfringens, the most resistant microorganism.
TI  - 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus Fusobacterium.
AB  - The 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of all currently defined Fusobacterium species and related taxa such as Leptotrichia buccalis, Sebaldella termitidis and Streptobacillus moniliformans, were analysed to examine inter- and intraspecies as well as subspecies relationships. For the ITS-amplification, a new eubacterial universal primer pair was designed and used. The majority of the Fusobacterium strains, along with L. buccalis showed one major, and two to three weaker, distinct bands (short and long versions) with lengths of 800-830 bp and 1000-1100 bp. Nevertheless, six other patterns were also found within the genus Fusobacterium, demonstrating its heterogeneity. The ITS region was sequenced and found to consist both of conserved motifs, which functioned as a framework for alignment, and of variable sites, which provided high phylogenetic resolution. Analyses of the ITS-DNA sequences and ITS relative length (short version) allowed species and subspecies differentiation in most cases. The results confirmed the strikingly distant relationship between Fusobacterium prausnitzii and the genus Fusobacterium. Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, along with Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium simiae and Fusobacterium periodonticum, formed a cluster with an inherently high potential for diversification. Other clusters were formed by Fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies with Fusobacterium gonidaformans and by Fusobacterium varium with Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium ulcerans. Fusobacterium russii as well as Fusobacterium perfoetens formed separate branches. Fusobacterium necrophorum subspp. necrophorum and funduliforme on the one hand, and Fusobacterium varium and Fusobacterium mortiferum on the other, were found to be very similar, even at the high-resolution ITS level.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in Sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the periodontal status of patients with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of SS patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. METHODS: 8 primary SS and 10 secondary SS patients were examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. All patients were diagnosed by the European Community Criteria. Control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. The comparison of clinical status was made in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. Microbiological assays of the subgingival dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (Periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (PA) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, Streptococcus oralis). RESULTS: The occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. No significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary SS patients for the PA test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. CONCLUSION: No significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or secondary SS patients compared with that of control subjects. The results of the present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with SS do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological features of six cases with intracranial abscess in  childhood].
AB  - From October 1988 to March 2001, 5 patients with 6 episodes of intracranial abscesses were admitted to Chiba-Children's Hospital. Average age when they were admitted was 10 years and 1 month. Initial clinical symptoms were fever in 5 cases, and headache in 1 case. It took 21 days from the appearance of the initial symptoms to diagnose the intracranial abscess. Four out of 5 patients had underlying diseases that were prone to cause intracranial abscess. Two patients of these were cyanotic congenital heart diseases (tetralogy of Fallot and asplenic heart), and the other 2 were sinusitis. Computed tomography revealed that brain abscess was found in 5 cases, and subdural empyema in 1 case. There were 3 single and multiple abscesses each. The most common lesion was the temporal lobe. Eight bacterial strains were isolated from 5 cases. Five were streptococci (3 were Streptococcus milleri group, other 2 were Streptococcus oralis and microaerophilic Streptococcus) and 3 were anaerobes (Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella bivia and Fusobacterium nucleatum). Antimicrobial therapy was started with panipenem-betamiprone in 3 cases, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin in the other cases resre ctinely. Duration of therapy ranged from 28 to 67 days (45 days, average). In 5 cases, drainage with craniotomy was performed in addition to antimicrobial therapy. One case was treated medically alone, but this was the only case with recurrence after 1 year 2 months. There were no serious complications such as intraventricular rupture of abscess. All patients had good outcomes, but mild neurological sequela was found in 1 case.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of indigenous Indians of Central America.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous Indians in Guatemala, Central America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. Plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. RESULTS: Plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. At the subject level, Actinomyces naeslundii and Peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. CONCLUSION: There was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. These latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. However, in this population where extensive plaque deposits and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.
TI  - Genome sequence and analysis of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum strain ATCC 25586.
AB  - We present a complete DNA sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. Although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own, this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. The F. nucleatum strain ATCC 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ERGO bioinformatics suite (http://www.integratedgenomics.com). The genome contains 2.17 Mb encoding 2,067 open reading frames, organized on a single circular chromosome with 27% GC content. Despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria, several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., and Lactococcus spp. The genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. Nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence, none of which has been reported in the literature. More than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides, sugars, metal ions, and cofactors have been identified. Biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine. The remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm. A principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate. Additionally, desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia, H(2)S, methyl mercaptan, and butyrate, which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth, thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium. The metabolic capabilities of F. nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth.
TI  - Maternal periodontitis and prematurity. Part II: Maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  - Clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled Oral Conditions and Pregnancy (OCAP) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting for traditional obstetric risk factors. In the current study we present measures of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal DNA probes to identify 15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery. In addition, maternal postpartum IgG antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood IgM level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. The potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "Orange" (Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella intermedia) and "Red" (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, and Treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal IgG, and fetal cord IgM, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). The prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers at postpartum. There was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of IgM seropositivity for one or more organisms of the Orange or Red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, P = 0.0015, chi square). Specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal IgM to C. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus 6.3%, P = 0.0002, as well as P. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, P = 0.0003). A lack of maternal IgG antibody to organisms of the Red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (OR) = 2.2; confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. The highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective Red complex IgG response coupled with a fetal IgM response to Orange complex microbes (combined OR 10.3; P < 0.0001). These data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. The high prevalence of elevated fetal IgM to C. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.
TI  - Periodontal bacteria in rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses.
AB  - Despite the high incidence of odontogenic abscesses in pet rabbits, published data on the bacteriology of these infections are lacking, and clinical cultures are often ambiguous, making antibiotic choices difficult. In order to define the bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. All specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella heparinolytica, Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus milleri group, Actinomyces israelii, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. These organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. The isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Antianaerobic activity of a cecropin---melittin peptide.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several small, 15-residue peptides that contain portions of the amino  acid sequences of both cecropin A and melittin have previously been shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against aerobic microorganisms, with no undesirable hemolytic properties. It would also be useful to know what effect these hybrid peptides have on anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of one hybrid, CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, were compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against 111 clinical anaerobic strains; Bacteroides fragilis, 24 strains; other Bacteroides fragilis group, 14 strains; other Bacteroides species, 13 strains; Fusobacterium nucleatum, six strains; Clostridium difficile, 22 strains; Clostridium perfringens, 10 strains, Propionibacterium spp., nine strains; and anaerobic cocci, 13 strains. RESULTS: Ninety per cent of strains belonging to the B. fragilis group, fusobacteria, propionibacteria and peptostreptococci were inhibited by 4 mg/L CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, and the antimicrobial activity was approximately in the same range as that of chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This investigation showed that the antimicrobial spectrum of this cecropin---melittin hybrid also includes anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum in endodontic flare-ups.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The extent to which Fusobacterium nucleatum is recovered from root canals of teeth that present with an interappointment flare-up following endodontic instrumentation was investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Included in the study were 28 patients that sought emergency treatment after initiation of root canal therapy. Only non-painful teeth that had been treated because of a necrotic pulp and periapical inflammatory lesion were studied. Root canal samples for bacterial analysis were taken, transported to a bacteriological laboratory, and processed for a semiquantitative assessment of bacterial isolates. Bacterial findings were correlated with self-assessed pain intensity as recorded by means of a Visual Analogue Scale. Clinical presentation of swelling and presence of exudate in the treated root canals were also linked. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered from all teeth examined. Gram-negative anaerobic coccoid rods (Prevotella species and Porphyromonas species) were frequent isolates. All teeth in patients who were reported to be in severe pain (Visual Analogue Scale > or = 6) displayed F nucleatum. Nine out of 10 of these teeth also had swelling and exudate in the root canals. Samples from the remaining patients that had teeth with less pain score showed a variable bacterial recovery. None of these teeth displayed F nucleatum. CONCLUSION: F nucleatum appears to be associated with the development of the most severe forms of interappointment endodontic flare-ups.
TI  - Dipeptide utilization by the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum, which can frequently be isolated from periodontal pockets, preferentially utilize proteins and peptides as growth substrates. In this study, we determined the size of peptide that is preferentially utilized as a source of energy and material for cell growth by P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and F. nucleatum using various sizes of poly amino acids consisting of two to approximately 100 molecules of aspartate or glutamate. Resting cells of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens utilized aspartylaspartate, while cells of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum utilized glutamylglutamate. The addition of aspartylaspartate to the culture medium increased the growth of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens, while the addition of glutamylglutamate promoted the growth of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. These results clearly indicate that dipeptides such as aspartylaspartate and glutamylglutamate can be utilized as growth substrates for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - [Retrospective analysis of Fusobacterium associated infections; experience at Aomori Prefectural Hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  - We experienced 108 cases of Fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at Aomori Prefectural Hospital during The 5 year-period from 1995 to 1999. A total of 433 organisms, included 113 Fusobacterium spp. (80 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 Fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 Fusobacterium varium, 4 Fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 Fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. The remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides fragilis group, Streptococcus milleri group, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - In vitro activities of the des-fluoro(6) Quinolone BMS-284756 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - BMS-284756, a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone, was very active against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic isolates from bite victims. It inhibited 403 of 420 (96%) isolates, including those of Moraxella spp., CDC group EF-4, and Eikenella corrodens at < or = 2 microg/ml and those of all Pasteurella spp. and Bergeyella zoohelcum at < or = 0.015 microg/ml. Fusobacterium russii and 6 of 11 Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates of animal bite origin were resistant, but isolates of human bite origin were susceptible, which suggests that they were of a different subspecies.
TI  - Comparison of the effectiveness of bacterial culture, 16S rDNA directed polymerase chain reaction, and checkerboard DNA-dNA hybridization for detection of Fusobacterium nucleatum in endodontic infections.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, nonmotile, obligatory anaerobic rod that is normally isolated from the oral cavity. Epidemiological studies have shown that this species is one of the most prevalent in primary root canal infections. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of bacteriological culture, 16S rDNA directed polymerase chain reaction and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for detection of F. nucleatum strains in infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions. Thirteen single-root teeth from adult patients, all having carious lesions, necrotic pulps, and radiographic evidence of periradicular bone loss were included in this study. Combining all methods, the results indicated that F. nucleatum was present in approximately 31% (4 of 13) of the specimens. Incidence of F. nucleatum in root canal infections, as evaluated in this study by polymerase chain reaction, culture, and DNA-DNA hybridization, was 15.4%, 15.4%, and 10.0%, respectively. Our data demonstrated that no method used herein could be considered superior for detecting F. nucleatum directly from clinical samples. However, the small number of samples examined and the low prevalence that was observed should be considered.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum supports the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis in oxygenated and carbon-dioxide-depleted environments.
AB  - The authors compared the differences in tolerance to oxygen of the anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, and explored the possibility that F. nucleatum might be able to support the growth of P. gingivalis in aerated and CO2-depleted environments. Both micro-organisms were grown as monocultures and in co-culture in the presence and absence of CO2 and under different aerated conditions using a continuous culture system. At steady state, viable counts were performed and the activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and NADH oxidase/peroxidase were assayed in P. gingivalis. In co-culture, F. nucleatum was able to support the growth of P. gingivalis in aerated and CO2-depleted environments in which P. gingivalis, as a monoculture, was not able to survive. F. nucleatum not only appeared to have a much higher tolerance to oxygen than P. gingivalis, but a significant increase in its numbers occurred under moderately oxygenated conditions. F. nucleatum might have an additional indirect role in dental plaque maturation, contributing to the reducing conditions necessary for the survival of P. gingivalis and possibly other anaerobes less tolerant to oxygen. Additionally, F. nucleatum is able to generate a capnophilic environment essential for the growth of P. gingivalis.
TI  - [Anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients. METHODS: 372 specimens were collected from surgical patients for anaerobe detection. To find a rapid detectable method, 110 specimens were collected for comparative studies by using indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFA), enzyme labeled antibody technique (ELAT) and general cultural method (CM). RESULTS: The isolation rate of anaerobes was rather high in pyothorax (88.9%), abdominal abscess (86.7%), appendicitis (83.9%) and cerebral abscess (all five cases were positive). In burn wounds, the rate was about 23.6% especially in deep burn wounds. Among 212 strains detected, the predominant anaerobes were as follows B. melaninogenicus (28.8%), B. fragilis (25%), F. nucleatum (7.5%), C. perfringens (7.5%), and peptostreptococcus (5.7%); most of them (87.8%) were non-sporing anaerobes. Mixed infection with aerobes accounted for 64%. The survey of rapid detection was conducted in B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, C. perfringens, F. nucleatum and peptostreptococcus. The detectable rate was higher in IFA (79.1%) and ELAT (80.9%) than in CM (37.3%). CONCLUSION: IFA and ELAT might be rapid, specific, sensitive, and simple for detecting anaerobes.
TI  - [Brain abscess in retroperitoneal perforated colonic diverticulitis].
AB  - The most frequent complications in diverticular disease are local abscess, perforation with peritoneal sepsis, fistula and ileus. Extraabdominal manifestation is an actual rarity. A haematogenous bacterial spread via portal vein with formation of liver abscess has seldom been described. But a complicated diverticular disease as a cause for a brain abscess is an absolute rarity. Our case presents a patient with brain abscess caused by asymptomatic, retroperitoneal perforated colonic diverticulosis. We discuss diagnostic steps both in diverticular disease and brain abscess and different surgical options in the treatment of colonic complicated diverticular disease.
TI  - [A comparative study of various evaluation methods of the antibiotic sensitivity  of strict anaerobic bacteria of the subgingival flora].
AB  - The study on the sensitiveness of slow-growing anaerobes bacteria to antibiotics  is delicate when you consider the technical motives that make it difficult to transpose the standard methods frequently used in microbiological laboratories. The three main methods used to determine susceptibility to antibiotics are: disk-diffusion test, antibiotics containing microdilution plates and ATB ANA (bioMerieux). The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of each of these methods on severe anaerobes bacteria isolated in sub-gingival flora of patients suffering from developing periodontitis (rapidly progressive periodontitis, refractory periodontitis, active stage of adult chronic periodontitis). The observed bacteria are: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros. Antibiotics used are: ampicilline, amoxicilline, tetracycline, erythromycine, metronidazole. The comparison of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (M.I.C) of each of these methods has permitted to show a strict correlation in the results observed with these three methods, if only the growth of the severe anaerobes bacteria on agar medium does not exceed 72 hours.
TI  - Periapical lesion progression with controlled microbial inoculation in a type I diabetic mouse model.
AB  - Uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may be a risk factor for the  development of large and/or debilitating periapical infections. The objectives of this investigation were to: (i) determine the effect of diabetes mellitus on the pathogenesis of periapical lesions with or without specific bacterial inoculations at the exposure sites, and (ii) test the sensitivities of two microbiological techniques in detecting the persistence of the bacterial inoculum in exposed pulps of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Periapical lesions were induced in first molars of 29 female NOD mice and 31 BALB/c controls. Acute (1-2 wk) or chronic (5 wk) exposures were either inoculated with a mixture of facultative and anaerobic bacteria or exposed to oral flora without inoculations. After death the teeth in the chronic groups were analyzed for the presence of the inoculated bacteria by culturing and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S rDNA. Periapical lesion size was measured histomorphometrically and the interleukin-6 content was measured immunohistochemically. The mortality among NOD mice with inoculated and sealed exposures was 83%, compared with 29% for BALB/c mice. In the inoculated and uninoculated chronic NOD mice groups, 38% of the animals versus none of the BALB/c mice died. The chronic uninoculated NOD mice lost significantly more weight at the time of death than controls. Polymerase chain reaction was more sensitive than culturing in detecting the inoculated anaerobic bacteria. In the animals that survived to the predetermined time periods, lesion size and interleukin-6 content in NOD and BALB/c mice were not statistically different.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - [Effect and mechanism of garlic juice and hydrogen peroxide on the degradation of lipopolysaccharide].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effect and mechanism of garlic juice and hydrogen peroxide on the degradation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Hot phenol-water method, phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether procedure, limulus lysate test, lowry's ash spetrographical examination and gas-liquid chromatography etc. were used in this study. RESULTS: The sequence of degradation effect was 30% hydrogen peroxide (H), the most powerful, followed by garlic juice (G), 1:1 diluted G and 3% H, their effects were dose dependent and G group was time dependent. The mechanism of H on LPS degradation was fractionization of phosphoryl in position 1 from lipid A, while that of G was complex, it could bound LPS molecule and influenced its effect besides LPS hydrolysis. CONCLUSION: The study may imply that the degradation position and mechanism on LPS are different and remain to be elucidated.
TI  - [Septic shock with liver abscess in an immunocompetence patient. Presentation of  an unusual Fusobacterium nucleatum infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium septicemia with septic metastasis is a very rare and potentially serous condition when complicated by septic shock. Most cases have been described in patients with humoral immunity disorders and/or severe underlying chronic disease. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old immunocompetent woman with a tonsil infection developed F. nucleatum septic shock with liver abscess formation. Outcome was rapidly favorable with antibiotic treatment and adapted intensive care, probably favored by the absence of an associated immune deficit. DISCUSSION: Despite its low incidence, F. nucleatum should be entertained as a possible cause of septicemia originating from a pelviperitoneal, pulmonary with abscess formation, or upper airway infection. Proper diagnosis is essential due to the risk of poor prognosis. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a commensal strictly anaerobic bacteria of the buccal cavity. It can cause dental and upper airway infections. Septicemia with secondary localization of F. nucleatum is very rare and the severity depends on the presence of associate septic shock. The immunopathological implications of these infections remain to be elucidated.
TI  - The heat shock response of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The heat-shock response of the oral Gram-negative bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum was examined. Different strains of F. nucleatum were grown at 37 C. 42 degrees C and 48 C in the presence of [35S]methionine. Cellular proteins synthesised after shifts to higher temperatures were analysed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Strains ATCC 10953, F1, F3 and Fev1 exhibited heat-shock response, and major proteins were observed at 60, 70 and 90 kDa. but increased protein synthesis was also observed for other proteins. Immunoblot analysis, using a panel of antibodies directed to epitopes on different known heat-shock proteins revealed cross-reactive proteins, indicating homology between Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium leprae and F. nucleatum heat shock proteins.
TI  - Determination of diamino acids in peptidoglycans from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Peptidoglycans isolated from two Fusobacterium species of anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for constituent amino acids. Hydrolysis conditions were varied to optimize the yield of diamino acids from peptidoglycan. The o-phthalaldehyde derivatives of the diamino acid stereoisomers were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (OPA-HPLC), and variations in the relative areas of the two peaks noticed during analysis of solid samples were attributed to sampling errors. Co-derivatization/injection experiments using standards of the meso and rac forms separated from commercial mixtures demonstrated that meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid and meso-lanthionine were peptidoglycan components in Fusobacterium varium and Fusobacterium nucleatum, respectively. The protonated molecules of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid and lanthionine were detected in peptidoglycan hydrolyzates by off-line, flow-injection electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). In ESI-MS-MS experiments under identical collision-induced dissociation (CID) conditions, peptidoglycan-derived and standard diamino acids exhibited similar fragmentations. Fragmentation pathways are proposed for each diamino acid. The results confirm that the meso forms of two different diamino acids are utilized in the peptidoglycans of Fusobacterium species.
TI  - Influence of in-vivo endotoxin liberation on anti-anaerobic antimicrobial efficacy.
AB  - The ability of cefoxitin, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam to cause gram-negative anaerobic bacteria to release endotoxin and the influence of such liberated endotoxin on antibiotic efficacy were investigated in in-vivo experiments in animal models. Experimental infections in various animal models (mice, hamster and infant rats) with cultures of wild and reference strains of Bacteroides fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were carried out by injecting these animals with different inocula (10(6), 10(7) and 10(8) cfu/ml) of the bacterial suspension, Appropriate doses of the test antibiotics were then injected and the plasma lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) release measured by the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) Assay. Evidence of worsening of the outcome of the infections post-therapy was assessed, including histopathological changes in the internal organs. Infection with generalized septicemia was established with F. nucleatum in the mice and hamster models while with the B. fragilis group, infections only led to intra-abdominal abscess formation. Plasma endotoxin release was higher in animals infected with F. nucleatum than B. fragilis and was unrelated to the bacterial inoculum. Imipenem, meropenem and cefoxitin, in that order, induced the highest levels of endotoxin activities in the animal model, particularly following F. nucleatum infection. Histological examination of the internal organs of various animals showed variation in the pattern of histopathological changes; grades 3-4 inflammatory changes in the liver were observed in the Fusobacterium-infected animals that were treated with the carbapenems and cefoxitin. Therapy with the other antibiotics did not exacerbate anaerobic sepsis. In this study, bacteremia did not lead to massive endotoxin release and antibiotic therapy appeared not to have negatively influenced the outcome of most of the gram-negative anaerobic infections, except for infections caused by Fusobacterium spp. However, it is conceivable that if the gastrointestinal tract is the source of the endotoxin in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, then the obligate anaerobes like Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species, which are members of the gut flora, may play a major role in the unfavorable outcome of antibiotic therapy in some of these infections.
TI  - Associations between serum antibody levels to periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of antibodies to periodontal microorganisms in the development of periodontal tissue destruction is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to 6 periodontal microorganisms and clinical subtypes of varying severity of early-onset periodontitis (EOP) in young African American adults. METHODS: The study group consisted of 159 African Americans aged 19 to 25 years (mean 22 years) and included 97 cases with EOP and 62 controls with no clinical signs of EOP. These subjects were selected from a nationally representative sample of adolescents who received an oral examination as part of the National Survey of Oral Health of United States Children in 1986-1987. The group was examined clinically a second time 6 years later and blood samples were collected. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM reactive to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed. RESULTS: Serum levels of IgG and IgA antibody reactive to P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans and IgA antibody to P. intermedia were significantly higher in generalized EOP cases compared to healthy controls. IgM antibody levels did not show any significant associations with EOP for any of the 6 bacterial species tested. There were no significant differences in antibody levels between controls and the 13 subjects in our study who were classified with localized EOP. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that antibodies to P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of EOP. Substantial longitudinal studies that monitor antibody levels and avidity prior to disease onset, during progression, and following clinical intervention will be necessary to fully understand the role of this component of the immune response in protection versus tissue destruction and the potential use in EOP risk assessment and disease management.
TI  - Regulation of human beta-defensin-2 in gingival epithelial cells: the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, but not the NF-kappaB transcription factor family.
AB  - Stratified epithelia of the oral cavity are continually exposed to bacterial challenge that is initially resisted by neutrophils and epithelial factors, including antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family. Previous work has shown that multiple signaling pathways are involved in human beta-defensin (hBD)-2 mRNA regulation in human gingival epithelial cells stimulated with a periodontal bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and other stimulants. The goal of this study was to further characterize these pathways. The role of NF-kappaB in hBD-2 regulation was investigated initially due to its importance in inflammation and infection. Nuclear translocation of p65 and NF-kappaB activation was seen in human gingival epithelial cells stimulated with F. nucleatum cell wall extract, indicating possible involvement of NF-kappaB in hBD-2 regulation. However, hBD-2 induction by F. nucleatum was not blocked by pretreatment with two NF-kappaB inhibitors, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. To investigate alternative modes of hBD-2 regulation, we explored involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. F. nucleatum activated p38 and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, whereas it had little effect on p44/42. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 and JNK partially blocked hBD-2 mRNA induction by F. nucleatum, and the combination of two inhibitors completely blocked expression. Our results suggest that NF-kappaB is neither essential nor sufficient for hBD-2 induction, and that hBD-2 regulation by F. nucleatum is via p38 and JNK, while phorbol ester induces hBD-2 via the p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Studies of hBD-2 regulation provide insight into how its expression may be enhanced to control infection locally within the mucosa and thereby reduce microbial invasion into the underlying tissue.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. To investigate the roles of TLRs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both TLR2- and TLR4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human CD14 and TLRs. When the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, Escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced NF-kappaB-dependent CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR2 cells. Although freeze-dried A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, freeze-dried P. gingivalis did not. Similarly, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, but LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea did not. Furthermore, LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea attenuated CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from U373 cells, the secretion of IL-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and ICAM-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. These findings indicated that LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea worked as antagonists for human TLR4. The antagonistic activity of LPS from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Supragingival and subgingival microbiota of adult patients with Down's syndrome.  Changes after periodontal treatment.
AB  - In this longitudinal study, five adult Down's syndrome patients with periodontitis were placed on a frequent recall visit schedule (every 6 weeks) after treatment, in order to investigate: 1) the microbiological status, both supragingivally and subgingivally, and the changes that occurred after treatment and 2) the effect of frequent professional supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota and clinical variables in these patients. The clinical variables recorded were probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding on probing and presence of plaque (full mouth, six surfaces per tooth). Microbiological examination was performed separately for supragingival and subgingival samples from the same site for 14 species, using whole genomic DNA probes and the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique. The findings indicate that, although a reduction of periodontal indices was noticed, plaque levels remained high (60%) even at the end of the experimental period. Periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently detected both supragingivally and subgingivally (>30%). The presence of a species supragingivally and the presence at the same time points subgingivally were correlated. This finding suggested that supragingival plaque acts as a reservoir for reinfection of treated sites. A reduction of the percentages of detection of these species was noticed 1 month after an oral hygiene period as well as at 3 and 6 months after treatment. Inadequate oral hygiene as performed by these patients probably affected supragingival, and consequently subgingival, plaque composition.
TI  - Lactoferrin, amylase and mucin MUC5B and their relation to the oral microflora in hyposalivation of different origins.
AB  - There are several reasons for hyposalivation, each affecting the salivary composition in different ways. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare lactoferrin, amylase and mucin MUC5B in stimulated whole saliva collected from subjects with hyposalivation of different origins and to relate the results to the presence of some microbial species associated with oral disorders. Albumin was determined as a marker of serum leakage. The characteristic feature for subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation was a large increase in lactoferrin, probably due to leakage through inflamed mucosal tissues, while it was a high albumin content for the group with primary Sjogren's syndrome, probably due to disruption of the fragile mucosa. The saliva composition in subjects with hyposalivation of unknown origin or due to medicines was close to that in the healthy controls. All three hyposalivation groups tended to display a decrease in the concentrations of MUC5B and amylase. None of the microbial species analyzed (streptococci, mutans streptococci, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus and enterics) correlated with concentration of MUC5B in saliva. The RT group, having the highest concentration of lactoferrin, had the lowest median number of F. nucleatum and was the only group in which median number of P. intermedia/P. nigrescens was zero.
TI  - Prior exposure of mice to Fusobacterium nucleatum modulates host response to Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Multiple periodontal pathogens sequentially colonize the subgingival niche during the conversion from gingivitis to destructive periodontal disease. An animal model of sequential immunization with key periodontal pathogens has been developed to determine whether T- and B-lymphocyte effector functions are skewed and fail to protect the host from pathogenic challenge. The present study was performed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of exposure to Fusobacterium nucleatum prior to Porphyromonas gingivalis. Group 1 (control) mice were immunized with phosphate-buffered saline, group 2 were immunized with F. nucleatum prior to P. gingivalis and group 3 were immunized with P. gingivalis alone. All the T-cell clones derived from group 2 demonstrated type 2 helper T-cell clone (Th2 subsets), whereas those from group 3 mice demonstrated Th1 subsets. Exposure of mice to F. nucleatum prior to P. gingivalis interfered with the opsonophagocytosis function of sera against P. gingivalis. In adoptive T-cell transfer experiments, in vivo protective capacity of type 2 helper T-cell clones (Th2) from group 2 was significantly lower than type 1 helper T-cell clones (Th1) from group 3 against the lethal dose infection of P. gingivalis. Western blot analysis indicated a different pattern of recognition of P. gingivalis fimbrial proteins between sera from group 2 and group 3. In conclusion, these studies suggest that exposure of a host to F. nucleatum prior to the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis modulates the host immune responses to P. gingivalis at the humoral, cellular and molecular levels.
TI  - Bacterial survival rate on tooth- and interdental brushes in relation to the use  of toothpaste.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Previous studies indicated that oral hygiene aids can play a role in the intra-oral translocation of pathogens. The survival rate of cariogenic and periodontopathogenic species on toothbrushes, with and without toothpaste, and interdental brushes was presently investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 12 periodontitis patients had their interdental spaces professionally cleaned with interdental brushes and their teeth with new toothbrushes with or without different dentifrices. Each time brushes were rinsed with tap water and stored dry at room temperature. At different time intervals an interdental brush or 4 tufts from a toothbrush were processed for vitality staining and selective and non-selective culturing procedures. RESULTS: Immediately after rinsing, a toothbrush without toothpaste harboured 10(7), 10(8) and 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) of respectively aerobic, anaerobic and black pigmented species. An insignificant decrease occurred the first 24 hours and after 48 hours still 10(4) CFU of aerobic and anaerobic species could be cultured. No periodontopathogen remained detectable at 8 hours, except for Fusobacterium nucleatum. The proportion of vital bacteria decreased in 48 hours from 50% to 30%. Comparable results were obtained for interdental brushes. The bacterial survival rate on toothbrushes was significantly reduced by the use of a detergent containing toothpaste by 2 log at baseline, another 2 log at 4 hours and an extra log more at 8 hours for aerobic and anaerobic species. A toothpaste without detergent only had an insignificant bactericidal effect. CONCLUSION: Toothpaste detergents decrease the survival rate of pathogenic species on a toothbrush and can thus limit the risk for bacterial translocation.
TI  - The localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  - Some Gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. In periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. We investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. Fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from 10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. Positive reactions with anti-Prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the middle pocket zones. In the middle and deep pocket zones, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area, but Eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. The present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans LuxS.
AB  - The cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. Although periodontal organisms do not appear to secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer II (AI-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in Vibrio harveyi. Here, we report that the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of V. harveyi luxS and secretes an AI-2-like signal. Cell-free conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain (E. coli AIS) expressing A. actinomycetemcomitans luxS induced luminescence in V. harveyi BB170 >200-fold over controls. AI-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. Incubation of early-log-phase A. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans or from E. coli AIS resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. In contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from E. coli AIS(-), a recombinant strain in which luxS was insertionally inactivated. A. actinomycetemcomitans AI-2 also induced expression of afuA, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that LuxS-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Finally, A. actinomycetemcomitans AI-2 added in trans complemented a luxS knockout mutation in P. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxS-regulated genes uvrB and hasF in this organism. Together, these results suggest that LuxS-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by A. actinomycetemcomitans and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.
TI  - [Effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and periodontal tissues].
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate, clinically and microbiologically, forty-four sites in 11 patients presenting with generalized chronic periodontitis. Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Probing Bleeding (PB), Probing Depth (PD) and Insertion Level (IL) were registered. Samples of subgingival plaque were collected in the same sites for cultivation of anaerobic bacteria and determination of microbiological morphotypes using dark field microscopy. Clinical and microbiological data were recorded on the baseline and 4 weeks after the adoption of a program to control supragingival plaque and calculus. The microbiological analysis categorized the degree of development as follows: 0--not detected, 1--scarce, 2--moderate and 3--abundant. The clinical results at the baseline and on the 28th day were, respectively: PI--1.73 +/- 0.10 and 0.30 +/- 0.08; GI--1.73 +/- 0.08 and 1.41 +/- 0.08; PB--0.91 +/- 0.04 and 0.59 +/- 0.07; PD--6.43 +/- 0.20 and 5.77 +/- 0.25; and IL--6.86 +/- 0.32 and 6.52 +/- 0.34. There was significant decrease in PI, GI, PB and PD. However, the difference in IL was not significant. The relative proportions of the microbial morphotypes observed under dark field microscopy at the baseline and on the 28th day were, respectively: coccoid cells--21.16 +/- 3.77 and 36.00 +/- 4.66; mobile bacillus--44.86 +/- 2.65 and 39.50 +/- 2.64; and total treponemes--24.66 +/- 3.08 and 19.25 +/- 2.75. The cultures presented, at the baseline and on the 28th day, respectively: Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (Pi/n)--1.36 +/- 0.18 and 0.43 +/- 0.11; Porphyromonas gingivalis--0.48 +/- 0.16 and 0.32 +/- 0.13; Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans--0.23 +/- 0.09 and 0.23 +/- 0.10; Fusobacterium nucleatum--0.32 +/- 0.14 and 0.41 +/- 0.13; and peptostreptococci--0.82 +/- 0.19 and 0.54 +/- 0.16. There was a significant increase in the number of coccoid cells and a decrease in the number of treponemes and Pi/n.
TI  - Absence of a specific subgingival microflora in adults with Down's syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease in Down's syndrome (DS) is generally characterized by a high degree of bone loss. Bone loss of 5 mm or more is observed in 70% of these subjects. Among DS subjects, considerable differences in disease progression occur. So far, no studies have been conducted in which specific properties of the subgingival microflora have been related to the condition observed. AIMS: To investigate (1) the subgingival microflora in DS subjects and other mentally retarded (control) individuals which were matched to the utmost and (2) to investigate the subgingival microflora of a "low-risk" and a " high-risk" group formed in DS subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 17 DS subjects and 17 control subjects were matched with respect to age, plaque level and bleeding on probing. In addition, the DS group was divided in a "low-risk" group (0-2 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=6) and a "high-risk"group (6-13 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=11). Prevalence and proportions of the putative periodontal pathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus in the subgingival plaque were determined using anaerobic culture techniques. No differences in the prevalence of distinct suspected periodontopathic bacteria and bacterial subgingival composition between the DS group and the control group could be established. Also no differences in the prevalence of the seven investigated microbial species between the "low-risk" and the "high-risk" group were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the lack of differences in microflora between the DS group and the control group, a specific effect of the microbiological composition in the periodontal status of subjects with DS can be excluded in this population. Host factors constitute the more likely explanation of the differences observed in DS.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Susceptibilities of oral bacteria and yeast to mammalian cathelicidins.
AB  - The effects of cathelicidins against oral bacteria and clinically important oral  yeasts are not known. We tested the susceptibilities of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis and Candida albicans to the following cathelicidins: FALL39, SMAP29, and CAP18. SMAP29 and CAP18 were antimicrobial, whereas FALL39 did not exhibit antimicrobial activity. Future studies are needed to determine the potential use of these antimicrobial peptides in prevention and treatment of oral infections.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. STUDY DESIGN: Pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: The results of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 DNA probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. The number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). Eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one DNA probe. The most prevalent species found were: Bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); Porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); Streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), Prevotella intermedia (22.2%), Prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and Eikenella corrodens (18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  - Antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (PC) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. Previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain PC as determined by reactivity with PC-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (IgG) G anti-PC are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. These data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-PC responses. Recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for PC are elevated in ApoE-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (oxLDL) in atherosclerotic plaques. These data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-PC could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxLDL, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. We therefore examined the ability of human anti-PC to bind to PC-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-PC to PC-bearing Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Our results indicated that PC-bearing strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed up to 80% of anti-PC IgG antibody from human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound to a PC-bearing strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a PC-negative strain. OxLDL also absorbed anti-PC from human sera, and oxLDL but not LDL reacted with up to 80% of the anti-PC in human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound directly to oxLDL but not to LDL. The data indicate that PC-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxLDL. We propose that PC-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to PC that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological study of adult periodontal disease].
AB  - The aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. A total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy sites were selected according to clinical criteria. The following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. Samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. In disease sites the most frequently isolated were: Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). The aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. Significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes 26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. The presence of motile rods, spirochetes and P. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. There were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.
TI  - Implantation of bacteria from human pulpal necrosis and translocation from root canals in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms recovered from infected human root canals were able to survive and translocate to a local lymph node when experimentally inoculated into the root canal system of germ-free mice. The microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated in two groups of experimental animals; group I (Gemella morbillorum) and group II (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Clostridium butyricum). G. morbillorum showed the highest frequency of colonization and translocation to the draining lymph node. In group II only F. nucleatum and C. butyricum colonized and translocated when inoculated in tri-association. When the bacteria from group II were inoculated in monoinfection all three species colonized the root canal of germ-free mice and translocated to the draining lymph node, but with different frequencies. We conclude that selective mechanisms occur in which some bacterial species are fit to survive, multiply, and translocate in the germ-free mouse model.
TI  - Metallic cough and pyogenic liver abscess.
AB  - The curious symptom of a metallic cough in association with a pyogenic hepatic abscess should heighten awareness of a fistula. We describe a 78-year-old female with severe diverticular disease, on long-term steroid treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica. She developed a pyogenic liver abscess, treated initially by antimicrobial therapy, and subsequently drained by ultrasound and computed tomography-guided percutaneous transhepatic pigtail catheterization. This was complicated by a fistulous communication between the abscess cavity and the bronchus, confirmed by radiology. After repeated attempts at drainage and antimicrobial therapy the abscess cavity, including the hepatobronchial fistula, resolved.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of electron beam-sterilized Gutta-Percha cones.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of electron beam sterilization on gutta-percha cones (GPCs) at different times after sterilization. An agar diffusion test was used with -one aerobic bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) and five oral anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Veillonella parvula). With each microorganism 30 agar plates were prepared, evenly distributed among three groups (group 1: unsterilized GPCs; groups 2 and 3: GPCs sterilized by electron beam irradiation 5 months and 5 yr before, respectively). One GPC of the selected group was placed in each plate. After incubation the area of inhibition was read on the agar plates. Inhibition of growth was significantly different for the tested microorganisms. However no significant difference was observed between the sterilized and unsterilized GPCs. Both the tested sterilized and unsterilized GPCs impair the growth of endodontic pathogens, with no influence of the time elapsed since sterilization.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  - AIM: The bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. METHODOLOGY: Single-species biofilms of Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a control. The antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. RESULTS: Iodine and NaOCl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against P. micros and P. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. Iodine and NaOCl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. However, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. None of the agents were effective against F. nucleatum after 15 min but NaOCl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. Colloidal silver was generally ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. NaOCl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. However the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of co-aggregation among Streptococcus mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of Fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The method involves coating hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. The sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. Results from the two methods were in close agreement. Streptococcus mitis-coated HAP discs were immersed in a 3H-labelled Fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14C-labelled P. gingivalis cell suspension. The discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3H and 14C radioactivity. The number of Fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that Fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of P. gingivalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (NO) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. The aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through NO production, on the periodontal disease pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid pH, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. The ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by pH and nitrite concentration. At acidity levels below pH 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mM) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. Addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the 3 bacteria. These results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.
TI  - Risk factors for anaerobic bloodstream infections in bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - The incidence of anaerobic bloodstream infections (BSI) in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recently increased at our institution. A retrospective case-control study of patients undergoing BMT from January 1995 through December 1998 was performed to determine the microbiological characteristics, epidemiology, and outcome of anaerobic BSI and to identify independent risk factors for infection. Anaerobic BSI occurred in 23 patients, for a rate of 4 BSIs per 100 BMT procedures, and it accounted for 17% of all BSIs that occurred during the study period. Infection occurred at a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 7+/-4 days after BMT and 7+/-5 days after the onset of neutropenia. Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most frequently isolated pathogen (in 17 patients), followed by Leptotrichia buccalis (in 4), Clostridium septicum (in 1), and Clostridium tertium (in 1). Two case patients (9%) died. Severity of mucositis was an independent predictor of anaerobic BSI (odds ratio, 4.4; P=.01). Controlling mucositis is critical for the prevention of anaerobic BSI in this patient population.
TI  - Septic arthritis of the hip due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are uncommon pathogens in septic arthritis. We report a case of pyarthrosis of the right hip caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum, following a transient synovitis in an otherwise healthy boy. There are only a few cases involving this species described in the literature. This report illustrates the difficulty of isolating this unusual organism and emphasises the usefulness of the Bactec blood culture bottles for the recovery of anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - C-telopeptide pyridinoline cross-links (ICTP) and periodontal pathogens associated with endosseous oral implants.
AB  - Detection of periodontal or peri-implant sites exhibiting progressing disease or  those at risk of deterioration has proven difficult. Pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), a marker specific for bone degradation found in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), has been associated with both bone and attachment loss in periodontitis and may be useful for predicting disease activity. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between ICTP levels and subgingival species around implants and teeth from 20 partially and 2 fully edentulous patients. GCF and plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal site of each implant and tooth. Radioimmunoassay techniques were utilized to determine GCF ICTP levels. Plaque samples were analyzed utilizing checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Traditional clinical parameters were assessed. Seventy-one implants and 370 teeth from 22 subjects were examined. ICTP levels and subgingival plaque composition were not significantly different between implants and teeth. Implant sites colonized by Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, and Streptococcus gordonii exhibited odds ratios of 12.4, 9.3, 8.1, and 6.7, respectively of detecting ICTP. These results suggest a relationship between elevated ICTP levels at implant sites and some species associated with disease progression. Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether elevated ICTP levels may predict the development of peri-implant bone loss.
TI  - Mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. This implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. Although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. However, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. The subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. This localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. These patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. The mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Untreated periodontal disease in Indonesian adolescents. Subgingival microbiota in relation to experienced progression of periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In an Indonesian population deprived of regular dental care, the experienced progression of disease between baseline (1987) and follow-up (1994) was investigated in relation to the composition of the subgingival microbiota at follow-up. At baseline the age ranged from 15 to 25 years. Clinical and microbiological evaluation was completed in 158 of the 167 subjects available at follow-up. METHODS: Plaque index (PI), pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and attachment loss (AL) were scored at the approximal surfaces of all teeth and subgingival calculus on the approximal surfaces of the Ramfjord teeth only (number of sites with subgingival calculus: NSC). A pooled sample of the deepest pocket in each quadrant was evaluated using microbiological culture techniques. RESULTS: At baseline the mean values of the clinical parameters were AL=0.35 mm, PI=1.01, BOP=0.80 PD=3.25 mm and NSC=6.04 and at follow-up AL=0.75 mm, PI=1.16, BOP=1.19, PD=3.34 mm and NSC=5.85. All parameters except PD and NSC showed a statistically significant increase. At follow-up the prevalence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 40%, of Porphyromonas gingivalis 67%, of Prevotella intermedia 66%, of Fusobacterium nucleatum 79%, of Bacteroides forsythus 16%, of Campylobacter rectus 4%, and of P. micros 6%. No differences in clinical parameters were found between groups with or without these micro-organisms. In 129 subjects AL of > or =2 mm at > or =1 site was found. Logistic regression showed three significant odds-ratio's for experienced progressive periodontitis: Plaque index (12.2), gender (3.4) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2.9). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that plaque is the most important parameter related to experienced disease progression, and that the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans may be associated with increased chance of disease progression.
TI  - Change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  - AIM: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with SRP. METHOD: After baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth SRP and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, TID, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, TID, n=9). Clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Quade test and between groups using ANCOVA. RESULTS: Mean PD was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. Corresponding values for mean AL were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). Levels and proportions of Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. Counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) of B. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02, 0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180 and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). Corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). Counts of Campylobacter species, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum and Prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. Members of the genera Actinomyces, Streptococcus and Capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. However, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of Actinomyces species during and after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.
TI  - Smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. Scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. METHODS: Four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (U-S); 90 untreated non-smokers (U-NS); 119 treated non-smokers (T-NS); and 171 treated smokers (T-S). Clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (CPI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), cumulative bleeding index (CBI), and cumulative suppuration index (CSI). Paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. RESULTS: U-S showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than U-NS (3.5 versus 2.7). Mean PD and mean CAL were higher in the T-S in comparison to the T-NS group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). Microbiological characteristics of U-S were a higher prevalence of Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of Peptostreptococcus micros (Pm) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). T-S patients were characterized by higher prevalence of Bacteroides forsythus (Bf), Pm, and Campylobacter rectus (Cr) and higher mean levels of Pm and Fn. The mean percentage of B. forsythus tended to be higher in the T-S group than in the T-NS group (6.9% versus 5.6%). The relative risk to be infected with Bf, Pm, and Cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). The chance to find > or =10% of Bf, Pm, and/or Fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when A. actinomycetemcomitans and P gingivalis were absent. Detection of > or =20% Pm/Fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, P= 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably Bf, Pm, Fn, and Cr. On the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  - Particulate Bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. This material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. The aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (NB), artificial saliva (AS) or Dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (DMEM + 10%FCS), with or without particulate Bioglass. All bacteria showed reduced viability following exposure to Bioglass in all the media after 1 h. This antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in either BM broth or 40% horse serum (HS) in RPMI. A considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. In further experiments it was found that the viability of S. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to NB pre-incubated with Bioglass. Additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. Moreover, a solution of NB and NaOH (of equivalent pH) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with Bioglass. Thus, particulate Bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. This may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.
TI  - [Antimicrobial effects of tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) on oral microorganisms].
AB  - The essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) exhibits antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal/fungicidal activity of a tea tree oil solution, of a new tea tree oil (Tebodont) and the respective placebo-gel, of a chlorhexidindigluconate-solution and of PlakOut was tested in vitro against ten different oral microorganisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from 0.0293% to 1.25% for the tea tree oil solution and from 0.0082% to 1.25% for the tea tree oil gel. The values for minimum bacteriocidal/fungicidal concentrations were in the range from 0.0521% to 2.5% for the tea tree oil solution and from <0.0098% to 3.33% for the tea tree oil gel. The most susceptible microorganisms were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, whereas Streptococcus mutans and Prevotella intermedia were the least susceptible ones. Both for the chlorhexidindigluconate solution and for PlakOut the values for the minimal inhibitory concentration and for the minimal cidal concentration were between <0.0002% and 0.0125%.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in primary Sjogren's syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of the effect of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed for planning preventive treatment. We carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pSS. METHODS: A clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, subjects with pSS harbored higher numbers and frequencies of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. On the smooth mucosa and tongue, the pSS subjects displayed an increased frequency of C. albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. C. albicans was detected about twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. In the gingival crevice region, the pSS group harbored slightly lower proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens than controls. The clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pSS subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pSS. CONCLUSION: The microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pSS. Specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pSS revealed further differences compared with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pSS.
TI  - Kinetics of coaggregation of Porphyromonas gingivalis with Fusobacterium nucleatum using an automated microtiter plate assay.
AB  - Coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum strains was previously studied using either a semi-quantitative macroscopic assay or radioactive tracer assays. A new automated microtiter plate assay is introduced, in which the plate reader (Vmax) was adapted to allow quantitative evaluation of the kinetics of coaggregation. F nucleatum PK 1594 coaggregated with P. gingivalis HG 405 with a maximal coaggregation rate of 1.05 mOD/min, which occurred at a P. gingivalis to F. nucleatum cell ratio of 1 to 2. F. nucleatum PK 1594 failed to do so with P. gingivalis strains A 7436 or ATCC 33277. Galactose inhibition of this coaggregation could be quantitatively measured over a wide range of concentrations to demonstrate its dose-dependent manner. P. gingivalis HG 405 failed to coaggregate with F. nucleatum strains ATCC 25586 and ATCC 49256. The assay used in the present study is a sensitive and efficient quantitative automated tool to study coaggregation and may replace tedious radioactive tracer assays.
TI  - Lipid peroxidation caused by oxygen radicals from Fusobacterium-stimulated neutrophils as a possible model for the emergence of periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The possible contribution of bacteria and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to the disease process of periodontitis was evaluated. DESIGN: Fusobacterium nucleatum has been associated with chronic adult periodontitis. Intracellular production and extracellular release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PMN stimulated by fusobacteria were evaluated. To estimate the potential extracellular damage that might be caused by the ROS, the lipid peroxidation (LPO) of an exogenous phospholipid, Intralipid, was assayed. METHODS: The ROS production of PMN was studied by the nitroblue tetrazolium and chemiluminescence tests. The levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals were used to indicate LPO. RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum strains stimulated neutrophils to produce a large amount of ROS, independently of plasma complement factors. The two strains tested induced considerable intracellular, but no extracellular chemiluminescence responses during the first hour, indicating that ROS were released into phagosomes. However an incubation period of 4 h, in the presence of the extracellular lipid resulted in a high degree of LPO, presumably caused by ROS release from the Fusobacterium-stimulated PMN. ROS production and lipid peroxidation could be counteracted by vitamin E. CONCLUSION: In periodontitis local bacteria might stimulate PMN to release ROS, which cause inflammation and destruction.
TI  - Relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. Some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. METHOD: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. Smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. Clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). Uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. RESULTS: Greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. Members of the orange and red complexes including E. nodatum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, P. intermedia, P. micros, P. nigrescens, B. forsythus, P. gingivalis and T. denticola were significantly more prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. The difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). The difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. CONCLUSIONS: The major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. The greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. Differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.
TI  - Heterogeneity of host immunological risk factors in patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of early-onset periodontitis (EOP) can be explained  by various host risk factors. Previous studies have focused on a single (among many possible) immunological risk factor and the association among the factors has not been assessed. We comprehensively investigated the associations among multiple host immunological risk factors in EOP patients to further elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of EOP. METHODS: Sixty-eight EOP patients (50 generalized EOP, 18 localized EOP), 51 EOP-suspected patients (S-EOP), 43 adult periodontitis (AP) patients, and 36 periodontally healthy subjects (HS) participated in this cross-sectional study. We examined peripheral neutrophil functions, phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral lymphocytes (lymphocyte subsets, T-cell proliferative activity), cytokine productivity (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interferon [IFN]-gamma, IL-4 and IL-6), serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers against 12 periodontal bacteria, and HLA class II genotypes. RESULTS: G-EOP, S-EOP, and AP patient groups showed significantly lower percentages of pan T cells and CD8-positive cells (P < 0.02) compared with the HS group. L-EOP patients showed depressed IL-4 and TNF-alpha productivity compared with the HS group (P < 0.02). The EOP group showed significantly elevated antibody levels against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Fusobacterium nucleatum compared with the HS group (P < 0.05). The frequency with DQB1*0503 was significantly higher in the EOP patient group than the HS group (P = 0.045) due to the higher frequency in L-EOP patients than the HS group (P = 0.035). There were wide interindividual variations in each of the tests among patient and HS groups; however, EOP patients showed wider intradiagnostic group variations in certain host defensive cell functions than the other groups. There were some EOP patients who showed extremely low or high values in some tests; the EOP patients could be further divided into subgroups according to their host defensive and immunological profiles. However, there was heterogeneity in some of the other host immunological tests even in the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The association of host immunological risk factors in EOP patients is widely varied and more complex than previously thought. These results indicate the difficulty of explaining the pathogenesis of EOP based on a single host risk factor and also emphasize the importance of critical assessment of not only EOP patient groups, but also individual patients.
TI  - New assay for measuring cell surface hydrophobicities of Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans.
AB  - Hydrophobic interactions, based on cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), are among the many and varied mechanisms of adherence deployed by the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Recently it was shown that, unlike C. albicans, C. dubliniensis is a species that exhibits an outer fibrillar layer consistent with constant CSH. Previously, C. dubliniensis grown at 25 or 37 degrees C was shown to coaggregate with the oral anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. C. albicans, however, demonstrated similar coaggregation only when hydrophobic or grown at 25 degrees C. This observation implied that coaggregation of Candida cells with F. nucleatum is associated with a hydrophobic yeast cell surface. To test this hypothesis, 42 C. albicans and 40 C. dubliniensis clinical isolates, including a C. albicans hydrophobic variant, were grown at 25 and 37 degrees C and tested with the established hydrophobicity microsphere assay, which determines CSH levels based on the number of microspheres attached to the yeast cells. The coaggregation assay was performed in parallel experiments. All C. dubliniensis isolates grown at either temperature, hydrophobic 25 degrees C-grown C. albicans isolates, and the C. albicans hydrophobic variant, unlike the 37 degrees C-hydrophilic C. albicans isolates, exhibited hydrophobic CSH levels with the microsphere assay and simultaneously showed maximum, 4+, coaggregation with F. nucleatum. The parallel results obtained for C. dubliniensis using both assays support the use of the CoAg assay both as a rapid assay to determine CSH and to differentiate between C. dubliniensis and C. albicans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. Silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. Copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. In contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/mL produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (CFU)/mL or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. A silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/mL produced log10 reductions in CFU/mL of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against P. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket. These results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Disinfection of dental impressions and occlusal records by ultraviolet radiation.
AB  - As chemical disinfection of dental impressions may cause adverse effects on materials and the dental personnel this study examined disinfection by ultraviolet radiation. Alginate, addition silicone rubber and red wax contaminated by Streptococcus salivarius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and five other bacteria in different suspension media were radiated for up to 18 min, and the number of colony forming units was compared to non-radiated controls. The effect of ultraviolet radiation differed among bacterial species and depended on the organic content in the suspension. Generally, the bacterial reduction after ultraviolet radiation was below 4 log steps and thus insufficient for disinfection of dental impressions.
TI  - Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the absence of NFkappaB function prior to induction of NK cell death triggered by a combination of anti-class I and anti-CD16 antibodies.
AB  - Addition of antibodies to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)  and F(c) gamma RIII (CD16) antigens resulted in the synergistic augmentation of natural killer (NK) cell death, and the loss of NK cell cytotoxic function. The binding of anti-CD16 and anti-class I antibodies to the same population of NK cells is required for the synergistic augmentation of NK cell death. Moreover, the addition of antibodies to leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1), which significantly inhibited the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin mediated NK cell death, had no effect on NK cell death mediated by anti-CD16 and anti-class I antibodies. The increase in NK cell death was associated with an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion, and concomitant inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) activation and the induction of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in NK cells treated with the combination of anti-class I and anti-CD16 antibodies. Furthermore, the inhibition of NFkappaB activation in anti-CD16 and anti-class I antibody treated NK cells was paralleled with a significant increase in inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB) protein expression. Overexpression of IkappaB super-repressor in YT, a NK cell line, caused significant up-regulation of TNF-alpha, PMA and ionomycin and Fusobacterium nucleatum mediated NK cell death. Overall, our studies suggest an important regulatory role for NFkappaB and JNK activities in MHC class I mediated NK cell death.
TI  - Periodontal pathogens produce quorum sensing signal molecules.
AB  - Different species of bacteria important in the composition of dental plaque were  tested for production of extracellular autoinducer-like activities that stimulate the expression of the luminescence genes in Vibrio harveyi. Several strains of Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were found to produce such activities. Interestingly, these bacteria belong to the same phylogenetic group, and they are periodontal pathogens important in the development of periodontal disease. They specifically produce extracellular signaling molecule related autoinducer-2 from V. haveyi. Nevertheless, they seem to be unable to produce homologues of acyl-homoserine lactones. Furthermore, Escherichia coli DH5alpha can be complemented by the introduction of a P. gingivalis gene with high homology to the luxS gene, which has been called luxS(P.g.).
TI  - Smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  - AIM: The present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. The population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. METHODS: Microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. The checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, T. denticola, P. micros, C. rectus, E. corrodens, S. noxia and S. intermedius. RESULTS: Using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. Using score 4 as cutoff, contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. No significant differences in detection rates were observed between smokers and non-smokers. Logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. The lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported the indication of a limited influence of smoking. CONCLUSION: Smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.
TI  - Topological investigations of the FomA porin from Fusobacterium nucleatum and identification of the constriction loop L6.
AB  - Porin FomA in the outer membrane of Fusobacterium nucleatum is a trimeric protein, which exhibits permeability properties similar to that of the well-known enterobacterial diffusion porins. The proposed topology model of the FomA monomer depicts the beta-barrel motif typical of diffusion porins, consisting of 16 antiparallel beta-strands. To investigate the accuracy of the FomA model and assess the topological relationship with other porins, individual deletions of variable size in seven of the eight surface-exposed regions of the porin were genetically engineered. Deletions in the predicted loops L1 to L7 were tolerated by the FomA porins, as judged by a normal assembly in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and a sustained pore-forming ability. Deletions in the largest proposed external region, loop L6, made the FomA porins considerably more permeable to antibiotics, indicating larger pore channels. The distinctly increased uptake rates and size exclusion limits displayed by the L6 deletion mutant porins, suggest that loop L6 folds back into the beta-barrel thereby constricting the native FomA channel. Thus, the position of the channel constriction loop appears to be shifted towards the C terminus in the FomA porin, as compared to the crystal structures of five non-specific diffusion porins.
TI  - Nitric oxide production and iNOS mRNA expression in mice induced by repeated stimulation with live Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - There have been few studies on the detection of direct nitric oxide (NO) production and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in vivo without using animal cell culture. We questioned whether NO and IFN-gamma could be produced at the site of infection. The peritoneal cavity of mice was used as the local infection model. NO and IFN-gamma in abdominal washings from these mice were measured directly at various times after injection of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative rod periodontal pathogen. The mice were divided into three groups: those treated with live bacteria (LB), those treated with heat-killed bacteria (HKB) and those untreated: normal (N). These mice were compared on the basis of cell filtration, NO and IFN-gamma production by injection of live bacteria (LFn) or heat-killed bacteria (HKFn). In the LB group, the total cell number increased corresponding to an increase in neutrophils after injection of both LFn and HKFn. A low level of NO was constantly produced in abdominal washings, but a significant amount of NO was synthesized in the LB group only 12 hr to 24 hr after injection of LFn. At the same time iNOS enzyme activity and iNOS mRNA expression were detected. IFN-gamma, which may contribute to enhance NO production, was also secreted at a high level from peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) at 12 hr and 24 hr in the LB group by stimulation of LFn. At 12 hr and 24 hr, iNOS positive cells in the LB group by infection of LFn were identified and shown to contain mostly macrophages. These findings indicate that live bacteria play important roles in NO production by macrophages. It is suggested that NO may contribute to the inflammatory response during F. nucleatum infection in periodontitis.
TI  - Validation of an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
AB  - The study of biofilm structure and function mandates the use of model systems for which a host of environmental variables can be rigorously controlled. We describe a model of supragingival plaque containing Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus oralis wherein cells are cultivated anaerobically in a saliva-based medium on hydroxyapatite discs coated with a salivary pellicle, with material and pieces of apparatus common to all microbiology laboratories. After 0.5 hr, 16.5 hrs, 40.5 hrs, and 64.5 hrs, the composition of adherent biofilms was analyzed by culture techniques, live/dead fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Repeated independent trials demonstrated the repeatability of biofilm formation after 40.5 hrs and 64.5 hrs. Brief exposures of biofilms to chlorhexidine or Triclosan produced losses in viability similar to those observed in vivo. This biofilm model should prove very useful for pre-clinical testing of prospective anti-plaque agents at clinically relevant concentrations.
TI  - [Bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  - Strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (PD) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. Destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. When the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. The first step in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. Such species namely Gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. These factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. The present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.
TI  - Effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - Both tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the synthesis of t-PA and PAI-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). LPS from different periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. The levels of t-PA and PAI-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The mRNA for t-PA and PAI-2 were measured by RT-PCR. The results showed t-PA synthesis was increased in response to all types of LPS studied and PAI-2 level was increased by LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, but not P. gingivalis. When comparing the effects of LPS from non-periodontal bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) with the LPS from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-PA to PAI-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to LPS from periodontal pathogens. The highest ratio of t-PA to PAI-2 was found in those cells exposed to LPS from P. gingivalis. These results indicate that LPS derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by HGF and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.
TI  - Spatial arrangements and associative behavior of species in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  - The spatial arrangements and associative behavior of Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus oralis strains in an in vitro model of supragingival plaque were determined. Using species-specific fluorescence-labeled antibodies in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the volumes and distribution of the five strains were assessed during biofilm formation. The volume-derived cell numbers of each strain correlated well with respective culture data. Between 15 min and 64 h, populations of each strain increased in a manner reminiscent of batch growth. The microcolony morphologies of all members of the consortium and their distributions within the biofilm were characterized, as were interspecies associations. Biofilms formed 15 min after inoculation consisted principally of single nonaggregated cells. All five strains adhered strongly to the saliva-conditioned substratum, and therefore, coadhesion played no role during the initial phase of biofilm formation. This observation does not reflect the results of in vitro coaggregation of the five strains, which depended upon the nature of the suspension medium. While the possibility cannot be excluded that some interspecies associations observed at later stages of biofilm formation were initiated by coadhesion, increase in bacterial numbers appeared to be largely a growth phenomenon regulated by the prevailing cultivation conditions.
TI  - Comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  - Despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. The objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16S rRNA gene directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. The diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. Samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. After trepanation sterile paper points and Hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. Specific PCR methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola. In addition, quantitative competitive PCR was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. The investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. Particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. The results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - Anaerobic bacterial extracts influence production of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by human dental pulp cells.
AB  - The role of human dental pulp (HDP) cells in extracellular matrix degradation in  pulpitis is still unclear. In this study, the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (SBEs) from Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the balance between the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and that of their inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)] by HDP cells were examined. HDP cells were treated with SBEs, and their culture media were later harvested. MMP activities and TIMP concentrations were determined by use of independent measurement strategies and sensitive ELISAs. The production of MMP-1 and MMP-2 was accelerated by all SBE. On the other hand, TIMP-1 production was slightly elevated; and TIMP-2 production was markedly inhibited by all of the extracts. SBEs derived from these anaerobic bacteria seemed to affect the acceleration of extracellular matrix degradation activity by HDP cells. These findings suggest that HDP cells stimulated by bacterial byproducts may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.
TI  - The sensitivity of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum to different (pseudo)halide-peroxidase combinations compared with mutans streptococci.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the peroxidase system with iodide is particularly effective against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In the present study, the effects of iodide, chloride and thiocyanate in combinations with lactoperoxidase (LP) and myeloperoxidase (MP) on the viability of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans and S. rattus were analysed. Bacteria were incubated in buffer solution containing peroxidase, substrate(s) and H2O2 (all in oral physiological concentrations), and plated after 0, 0.5 and 1 h. The oxidation product of iodide was the most bactericidal against all the bacteria tested. The effect was significantly weaker on mutans streptococci. Physiological concentrations of thiocyanate abolished the effects of LP-H2O2-iodide and MP-H2O2-iodide/chloride combinations. Thiocyanate-peroxidase systems have already been used in oral hygiene products. The incorporation of iodide into these products could make them much more potent against periodontal pathogens, and also help to prevent transmission of these pathogens from person to person via saliva.
TI  - Interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 regulation in oral epithelial cells by selected periodontal bacteria: multiple effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis via antagonistic mechanisms.
AB  - Interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules produced by epithelial cells. Previously, we showed that expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) by gingival epithelial cells increases following interaction with several putative periodontal pathogens. In contrast, expression of IL-8 and ICAM-1 is reduced after Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 challenge. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two molecules in bacterially infected gingival epithelial cells. Experimental approaches included bacterial stimulation of gingival epithelial cells by either a brief challenge (1.5 to 2 h) or a continuous coculture throughout the incubation period. The kinetics of IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression following brief challenge were such that (i) secretion of IL-8 by gingival epithelial cells reached its peak 2 h following Fusobacterium nucleatum infection whereas it rapidly decreased within 2 h after P. gingivalis infection and remained decreased up to 30 h and (ii) IL-8 and ICAM-1 mRNA levels were up-regulated rapidly 2 to 4 h postinfection and then decreased to basal levels 8 to 20 h after infection with either Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, or P. gingivalis. Attenuation of IL-8 secretion was facilitated by adherent P. gingivalis strains. The IL-8 secreted from epithelial cells after F. nucleatum stimulation could be down-regulated by subsequent infection with P. gingivalis or its culture supernatant. Although these results suggested that IL-8 attenuation at the protein level might be associated with P. gingivalis proteases, the Arg- and Lys-gingipain proteases did not appear to be solely responsible for IL-8 attenuation. In addition, while P. gingivalis up-regulated IL-8 mRNA expression, this effect was overridden when the bacteria were continuously cocultured with the epithelial cells. The IL-8 mRNA levels in epithelial cells following sequential challenge with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum and vice versa were approximately identical and were lower than those following F. nucleatum challenge alone and higher than control levels or those following P. gingivalis challenge alone. Thus, together with the protease effect, P. gingivalis possesses a powerful strategy to ensure the down-regulation of IL-8 and ICAM-1.

TI  - Early colonization of dental implants by putative periodontal pathogens in partially edentulous patients.
AB  - There is limited scientific information available on the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets in partially edentulous individuals. Knowledge about this process is one step in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. In this study, the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets by putative periodontal pathogens was studied in 20 partially edentulous individuals using anaerobic culture techniques. At baseline, the presence and levels of putative periodontal pathogens in the microflora of periodontal pockets and saliva were established. Immediately after loading of the titanium implants and after 6 and 12 months the presence and levels of selected putative periodontal pathogens were determined in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. A second aim was to detect bacterial contamination of the implant site and the inside of the implant. At baseline, the most frequently isolated species from the periodontal pockets were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus micros. Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 9, 2 and 3 patients respectively. Six months after placing of the bridges, the majority of the implant sites had detectable levels of most periodontal bacterial species with the exception of A. actinomycetemcomitans which could not be isolated from any of the peri-implant samples during the experimental period, although 2 patients had this organism at baseline. In 2 patients with detectable subgingival P. gingivalis at baseline this species was found after 12 months in the peri-implant sites. One of these patients lost 2 implants which was associated with a high proportion of P. gingivalis in the peri-implant pockets. A second patient developed 2 fistulas around 2 implants at 8 months and this event was also associated with the presence of P. gingivalis. It is concluded that proper periodontal infection control before installment of dental implants in partially edentulous patients may prevent early bacterial complications.
TI  - Comparison of the hydrophobic properties of Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis.
AB  - Although Candida dubliniensis is a close genetic relative of Candida albicans, it colonizes and infects fewer sites. Nearly all instances of candidiasis caused by C. dubliniensis are restricted to the oral cavity. As cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) influences virulence of C. albicans, CSH properties of C. dubliniensis were investigated and compared to C. albicans. Growth temperature is one factor which affects the CSH status of stationary-phase C. albicans. However, C. dubliniensis, similar to other pathogenic non-albicans species of Candida, was hydrophobic regardless of growth temperature. For all Candida species tested in this study (C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis), CSH status correlated with coaggregation with the anaerobic oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. Previous studies have shown that CSH status of C. albicans involves multiple surface proteins and surface protein N-glycans. The hydrophobic surface glycoprotein CAgp38 appears to be expressed by C. albicans constitutively regardless of growth temperature and medium. C. dubliniensis expresses a 38-kDa protein that cross-reacts with the anti-CAgp38 monoclonal antibody; however, expression of the protein was growth medium and growth temperature dependent. The anti-CAgp38 monoclonal antibody has been shown to inhibit adhesion of C. albicans to extracellular matrix proteins and to vascular endothelial cells. Since protein glycosylation influences the CSH status of C. albicans, we compared the cell wall mannoprotein content and composition between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. Similar bulk compositional levels of hexose, phosphate, and protein in their N-glycans were determined. However, a component of the C. albicans N-glycan, acid-labile phosphooligomannoside, is expressed much less or negligibly by C. dubliniensis, and when present, the oligomannosides are predominantly less than five mannose residues in length. In addition, the acid-labile phosphooligomannoside profiles varied among the three strains of C. dubliniensis we tested, indicating the N-glycan of C. dubliniensis differs from C. albicans. For C. albicans, the acid-labile phosphooligomannoside influences virulence and surface fibrillar conformation, which affects exposure of hydrophobic surface proteins. Given the combined role in C. albicans of expression of specific surface hydrophobic proteins in pathogenesis and of surface protein glycosylation on exposure of the proteins, the lack of these virulence-associated CSH entities in C. dubliniensis could contribute to its limited ability to cause disseminated infections.
TI  - Interleukin-6 deficiency increases inflammatory bone destruction.
AB  - Periapical bone destruction occurs as a consequence of pulpal infection. In previous studies, we showed that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the primary stimulator of bone destruction in this model. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is induced in these infections and has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we determined the role of IL-6 in regulating IL-1 expression and bone resorption. The first molars of IL-6 knockouts (IL-6(-/-)) and wild-type mice were subjected to surgical pulp exposure and infection with a mixture of four common pulpal pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. Mice were killed after 21 days, and bone destruction and cytokine expression were determined. Surprisingly, bone destruction was significantly increased in IL-6(-/-) mice versus that in wild-type mice (by 30%; P < 0.001). In a second experiment, the effects of chronic (IL-6(-/-)) IL-6 deficiency and short-term IL-6 deficiency induced by in vivo antibody neutralization were determined. Both IL-6(-/-) (30%; P < 0.001) and anti-IL-6 antibody-treated mice (40%; P < 0.05) exhibited increased periapical bone resorption, compared to wild-type controls. The increased bone resorption in IL-6-deficient animals correlated with increases in osteoclast numbers, as well as with elevated expression of bone-resorptive cytokines IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, in periapical lesions and with decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These data demonstrate that endogenous IL-6 expression has significant anti-inflammatory effects in modulating infection-stimulated bone destruction in vivo.
TI  - Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.
TI  - Streptococcus viridans intra-amniotic infection associated with antecedent cunnilingus.
AB  - Introduction of bacteria into the amniotic cavity has been associated with oral sex through an ascending infectious route. Previous reports have implicated both Capnocytophaga and Fusobacterium nucleatum via this process. We report a case of Streptococcus viridans intra-amniotic infection occurring at 25 weeks' gestation. Patient questioning revealed a close temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and previous episodes of cunnilingus. The diagnosis of subclinical bacterial colonization of the amniotic fluid should be considered in patients presenting with preterm labour and no apparent aetiology. A history of recent cunnilingus may be associated with the presence of Streptococcus viridans in the amniotic fluid.
TI  - Identification and characterization of human immunoglobulin G Fc receptors of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Several human pathogens express components which can bind to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins. This study was undertaken to characterize the human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-binding activity of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a suspected pathogen involved in periodontal diseases. Fc-binding activity was detected using whole-cell, cell envelope and outer membrane fractions, and it was found to be associated with polypeptides of 40 kDa and 42 kDa, respectively. Amino terminal sequencing of these components revealed them to be homologous to the bacterial porin encoded by fomA gene. Further sequencing of internal peptide fragments obtained by CNBr cleavage suggested that these two proteins are probably isoforms. In summary, we show that a porin-like protein on the surface of F. nucleatum can bind the Fc fragment of the human immunoglobulin G, and this protein may act as a virulence factor to facilitate this bacterium in evading host immune surveillance system.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  - Recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which Porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. It has been proposed that dental plaque bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In this regard, Streptococcus sanguis and P. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. Here we report that P. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of Actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Trepenoma denticola failed to aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. Additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of P. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. In summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by P. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) P. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.
TI  - Attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 to mammalian cells and its coaggregation with periodontopathogenic bacteria are mediated by the same galactose-binding adhesin.
AB  - It has been shown that Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 coaggregates with Prophyromonas gingivalis PK1924 through a galactose-binding adhesin. In the present study, attachment of F. nucleatum PK1594 to a variety of mammalian cells was characterized. F. nucleatum PK1594 attached to all eukaryotic cells tested, including human buccal epithelial cells, gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts, HeLa cells and murine lymphocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These attachments were (i) inhibited by galactose, lactose and N-acetylgalactosamine and (ii) inhibited by monoclonal antibody specific for the galactose-binding adhesin of F. nucleatum PK1594. In addition, a coaggregation-defective mutant of F. nucleatum PK1594 (PK2172), which does not exhibit galactose binding activity, did not attach to the mammalian cells. Coaggregation of F. nucleatum PK1594 with P. gingivalis PK 1924 and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans JP2, but not with other bacteria, showed a similar pattern with sugars, monoclonal antibody, and the adhesin-deficient mutant. The results suggest that the attachment of F. nucleatum PK1594 to mammalian cells and its coaggregation with periodontal pathogens are mediated by the same galactose-binding adhesin.
TI  - Polarization of Porphyromonas gingivalis-specific helper T-cell subsets by prior  immunization with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Antigen-specific T-cell clones were obtained from mice immunized with Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 and/or Porphyromonas gingivalis 381. 10 BALB/c mice per group were immunized with F. nucleatum followed by P. gingivalis, or with P. gingivalis alone by intraperitoneal injection of viable microorganisms. Spleen T cells were isolated and stimulated in vitro with viable P. gingivalis cells to establish P. gingivalis-specific T-cell clones. T-cell phenotypes and cytokine profiles were determined along with T-cell responsiveness to F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis. Serum immunoglobulin G antibody titers to F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All the T-cell clones derived from mice immunized with F. nucleatum followed by P. gingivalis demonstrated Th2 subsets, while those from mice immunized with P. gingivalis alone demonstrated Th1 subsets based on the flow cytometric analysis and cytokine profiles. All T-cell clones from both groups were cross-reactive to both P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum antigens. Phenotypes of T-cell clones were all positive for CD4. Mean post-immune serum IgG antibody levels to F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis were significantly higher than the pre-immune levels (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). There were no significant differences in the antibody titers between the two groups. It was concluded that P. gingivalis-specific T cells initially primed by cross-reactive F. nucleatum antigens were polarized to Th2 subset, while T cells stimulated with P. gingivalis alone maintained the profile of Th1 subset.
TI  - Testing meningococcal vaccines for mitogenicity and superantigenicity.
AB  - Proteins with intrinsic mitogenic properties are widely represented in prokaryotes, such as in different Streptococcus species (1-3), Candida albicans (4), and Eikenella corrodens (5). Specifically, several bacterial porins of Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and pathogenic Neisseria species have been shown to induce nonspecific proliferation of lymphocytes (6-12).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - The virulence of mixed infection with Streptococcus constellatus and Fusobacterium nucleatum in a murine orofacial infection model.
AB  - Orofacial infections are usually polymicrobial, and it is the microbial interactions of pathogenic species that cause tissue destruction. In this study, the microbial interaction between Streptococcus constellatus and Fusobacterium nucleatum was characterized using a murine orofacial infection model. A mixture of viable S. constellatus and F. nucleatum cells (both 2 x 10(8) CFU/mouse) was injected into the submandible; as a result, all of the test mice died. In contrast, none of the experimental animals monoinjected with either S. constellatus or F. nucleatum died (P<0.001), indicating that the synergism between the two resulted in the virulence. When a mixture of viable S. constellatus cells and a culture filtrate of F. nucleatum was tested, lethality and the bacterial cell count per lesion were significantly enhanced as compared with monoinjections (P<0.02). However, the virulence of F. nucleatum was not enhanced by infection of a culture filtrate of S. constellatus. The enhancement of virulence was observed even when viable S. constellatus cells and the culture filtrate of F. nucleatum were injected at separate sites. Heat treatment of the culture filtrate of F. nucleatum did not affect the enhancement. These results indicate that a heat-stable substance(s) produced by F. nucleatum contributes to the microbial synergy of S. constellatus and F. nucleatum in orofacial infections.
TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
TI  - [Clinical use of tetracyclines in the treatment of periodontal diseases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are a number of chemically different tetracycline homologues. The older group of tetracyclines, which was introduced in the 1950-60s, includes tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and demeclocycline. The newer group of tetracyclines includes doxycycline, methacycline and minocycline. PHARMACOKINETICS: Elevated concentration of tetracycline in gingival fluid with respect to blood levels was an unexpected phenomenon. Patients given 250 mg every 6 hours had average crevicular fluid concentrations between 4 to 8 g/ml and blood concentrations between 2 to 2.5 g/ml after 48 hours. The levels in crevicular fluid and blood of volunteers who received 250 mg every 12 hours were 2 to 4 g/ml and 0.3 to 1.4 g/ml respectively after 48 hours. The concentration of doxycycline in gingival fluid after administration of 200 mg/1st day and then 100 mg/day achieved average level of 6 g/ml. Minocycline, a semisynthetic derivate of tetracycline, has shown to yield gingival fluid levels 5 times as high as serum levels after administration of 100 mg every 12 hours. MECHANISMS OF ACTION: Tetracycline and its derivates demonstrate high in vitro activity against most periodontal bacteria, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Wolinella recta and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The study of in vitro susceptibility of these 6 bacterial strains showed that, in regard to blood level, minimal inhibitory concentration is higher and it is the concentration of the drug that can be expected in gingival fluid following oral administration of 100 mg per day (doxycycline) (Table 1). The anti-inflammatory effect of tetracyclines was demonstrated histologically not only by reducing the size of the infiltrated connective tissue, but qualitative changes were also observed. Golub and associates have presented evidence that tetracyclines inhibit collagenase activity in gingival fluid and in tissue cultures. Therapeutic concentrations of tetracycline inhibit chemotaxis, phagocytosis and random migration of neutrophils in vitro. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Great amounts of tetracyclines cause gastrointestinal disorders, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Tetracyclines suppress activity of the enzymes in the bowel and pancreas. During longlasting administration they can damage the liver and kidneys. Tetracyclines can cause photo-sensibilization. They make deposits with calcium in bones, specially during prenatal period and during growth, so they can cause permanent teeth discoloration and hypoplasia. INTERACTIONS: The most important interaction is with penicillin. These two kinds of antibiotics antagonize and decrease the therapeutic effect of each other, so their administration at the same time should be avoided. A significant interaction occurs between tetracyclines and metal ions. This interaction often has been observed in conjunction with use of various antacids. Tetracyclines can also influence the production and absorption of vitamin K. Nephrotoxicity has been reported when tetracyclines have been administrated in conjunction with methoxyflurane. INDICATIONS: Doxycycline, due to its advantages over tetracycline (Table 2), is indicated in treating destructive periodontal diseases including: juvenile periodontitis and refractory marginal periodontitis. Doxycycline therapy may be used for acute periodontal abscess and if the conditions are accompanied by general symptoms. Prophylactic application is recommended for implant placement procedures including membranes in guided tissue regeneration. RESULTS OF CLINICAL STUDY: ORAL APPLICATION: In spite of great number of published investigations this paper presents only the results of placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. There is evidence that therapy in localized juvenile periodontitis should eliminate Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, since 95% of patients harbored this bacteria. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
TI  - Photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens In vitro.
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. PDT is a potential adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. However, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. We have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. Potent antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of CFU per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. The use of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.
TI  - Competition for glucose between Candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  - The competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between Candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. A chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05/h. A mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with C. albicans. Seven bacterial species Streptococcus sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, Lactobacillus casei, Veillonella dispar, Eubacterium saburreum and Fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. The yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. Only three bacterial species, S. sobrinus, L. casei and E. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. C. albicans was also able to become established in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. L. casei, S. mitis and S. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than C. albicans. All the bacteria, except for E nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than C. albicans. The results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for C. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate in advanced periodontitis patients not responding to mechanical therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Between 4 and 8% of periodontitis patients are reported to respond poorly to conventional therapy. In these cases, adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics might be a reasonable therapeutic approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemic amoxicillin/clavulanate as adjunct to periodontal surgery on the predominant subgingival microorganisms in patients not responding to mechanical therapy. Furthermore, the bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate was analyzed before and after therapy in order to assess the clinical validity of pre-therapeutic susceptibility testing. METHODS: In 10 periodontitis subjects with no subgingival detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the predominant subgingival organisms were identified using the identification system Rapid ID 32 A as well as antibiotic susceptibility was tested utilizing the E test. RESULTS: Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella oralis were detected in 7/10 subjects and could no more recovered after therapy. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus micros were present in 5/10 patients before treatment, but could be detected in 6/10, resp. 3/10 after therapy. In 4/10 subjects harboring F. nucleatum and in 3/10 with P. micros, those organisms were not targeted by amoxicillin/clavulanate, although post-treatment testing revealed their alleged susceptibility (MICs varied from 0.023 to 0.032 microg/ml, resp. from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the outcomes of conventional methods of susceptibility testing have to be interpreted very carefully when being used for treatment of plaque-related diseases. Furthermore, since the endpoint of systemic antibiotic treatment as adjunct to conventional therapy is elimination of F. nucleatum or P. micros in patients harboring these organisms, the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate appears not to be justified.
TI  - Microbiological parameters associated with IL-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Polymorphisms in the cluster of IL-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in IL-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. METHOD: The study included 108 subjects in good general health. Clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. The levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Fingerstick blood samples were collected for IL-1A (+4845) and IL-1B (+3954) genotyping using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: The proportion of IL-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. Prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, the Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter showae and Streptococcus constellatus. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus gordonii and 3 Capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. Significantly higher mean counts of B. forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, the F. nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum, Campylobacter rectus, C. showae, Eubacterium nodatum, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. The increase was due to increased numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.
TI  - The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  - A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.
TI  - Automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  - The present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. Following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. Test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. Due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. Automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. Results are shown for six taxa (Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/Prev. nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii/Strep. oralis/Strep. sanguis, Strep. sobrinus, and Veillonella dispar/ V. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. Results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. This work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of two periodontitis populations of different geographical origin. A comparison between Spain and The Netherlands.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the subgingival microbiota of two geographically distinct patient populations using identical clinical and bacteriological methods. Adult patients with a diagnosis of periodontitis were consecutively selected according to pre-defined clinical criteria. Microbiological samples were taken from the deepest four sites with bleeding. The samples were plated on blood agar plates, for the determination of the total anaerobic counts and identification of specific bacterial pathogens, and on TSBV and McConkey for isolation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods, respectively. Thirty-one patients in Spain and 30 patients in The Netherlands were selected. Both patient groups showed similar clinical characteristics, both in terms of age, gender and periodontal clinical variables. A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent (23.3% vs. 3.2%) in the Dutch group, while Porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly more prevalent (64.5% vs. 36.7%) in the Spanish group. Bacteroides forsythus and most commensal periodontal pathogens showed similar prevalences, except Peptostreptococcus micros that was significantly more frequent in the Dutch group (96.7% vs. 74.2%). In summary, the subgingival microbiota from the Spanish group was characterised by a high prevalence of P. gingivalis and low of A. actinomycetemcomitans, while the flora from the Dutch group was characterised by a high prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. micros.
TI  - Cytokine, elastase and oxygen radical release by Fusobacterium nucleatum-activated leukocytes: a possible pathogenic factor in periodontitis.
AB  - Periodontitis is characterised by tissue destruction caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic enzymes, which are released by the interaction between bacteria and phagocytes. We estimated the ability of Fusobacterium species to induce release of tissue destructive and proinflammatory mediators from in vitro activated peripheral leukocytes. ROS was measured with the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) method, elastase with a specific chromogenic substrate and cytokines, including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) with a sandwich ELISA method. Various clinical isolates of unopsonized Fusobacterium species stimulated the neutrophils to an increased NBT- reduction. IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-8 and elastase were released in significantly higher levels from neutrophils stimulated by Fusobacterium species. In conclusion, unopsonized Fusobacterium species can induce increased production of oxygen radicals, cytokines and elastase from leukocytes activated in vitro.
TI  - Detection of major putative periodontopathogens in Korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a Korean population so far. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in Korean patients by culture-independent methods. METHODS: A total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (AP) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. AP samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [PD]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm PD) in each patient. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. Aliquots of PCR products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. RESULTS: All diseased sites harbored Fusobacterium sp., while Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema sp., and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. In sites of periodontally healthy subjects, Fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). Treponema sp., P. gingivalis, and B. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. P. micros, P. intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy sites, respectively. The prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of Fusobacterium sp. and B. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Using highly sensitive methods relying on 16S ribosomal RNA-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with AP patients in a Korean population. With the exceptions of Fusobacterium sp. and B. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.
TI  - The microbial spectrum of brain abscess with special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer RapID ANA II panel and E-test methods, respectively. Characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic in another three (16.6%) patients. There were nine anaerobic isolates. The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), Bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). A total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were Gram-positive cocci were recovered. All the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of P. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. There was complete agreement between the identification based on biochemical profiles and RFLP patterns. These findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.
TI  - [Analysis using ELISA test of antibody response to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens in subjects with periodontal disease].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To know the synthesis of IgG, IgA, and IgM to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens in serum, crevicular liquid and saliva in subjects with periodontal disease, using ELISA test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 26 patients with high bias to the disease aged less than 35 years and 30 individuals with comparable age and with scarce bias to the disease. RESULTS: No differences were found for IgG and IgM titers between the groups, except for IgM to E. corrodens. For IgA, differences were found when the saliva and crevicular liquid were studied for both bacteria, as occurred in serum IgA compared to E. corrodens. In all the cases antibody levels were lower in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The lower synthesis of IgM and IgA, fundamentally the latter, to F. nucleatum and E. corrodens in patients with periodontal disease would contribute to the pathogenesis of this illness.
TI  - B-Cell deficiency predisposes mice to disseminating anaerobic infections: protection by passive antibody transfer.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that a high proportion of RAG-2 SCID knockout mice, which lack T and B cells, develop orofacial abscesses and disseminated infections following pulpal infection, whereas immunocompetent control mice do not. In the present study, we sought to identify the components of the adaptive immune response which contribute to protection against disseminating anaerobic infections and sepsis. For this purpose, various genetically engineered immunodeficient mice were employed, including RAG-2 SCID, Igh-6 (B-cell deficient), Tcrb Tcrd (T-cell deficient) and Hc(0) (C5 deficient). For abscess induction, the mandibular first molars were subjected to pulp exposure on day 0. Teeth were infected with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros, and teeth were sealed to prevent communication with the oral cavity. The findings demonstrate that both RAG-2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice, but not T-cell- or C5-deficient mice, have increased susceptibility to the development of disseminating anaerobic infections. Abscess-susceptible RAG-2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice also showed a significant loss of body weight, splenomegaly, and absent antibacterial antibody production. Furthermore, dissemination was significantly reduced, from 74 to 25%, in susceptible RAG-2 mice by passively transferred antibody, predominantly immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b) and IgM, against the infecting bacterial innoculum. Fractionated IgG-enriched preparations were more efficient in transferring protection than IgM preparations. We conclude that an antibody-mediated mechanism(s), most likely bacterial opsonization, is of importance in localizing anaerobic root canal infections and in preventing their systemic spread.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections.
AB  - Anaerobic organisms play a major role in pleuropulmonary infections. Clinical manifestations range from simple aspiration to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonias to chronic infections, such as lung abscess and empyema. Implicated pathogens are usually of endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections is based on recovering the etiological agent from clinical specimens. Appropriate specimens include pleuml fluid, transtracheal aspirates, transthoracic aspirates and fiberoptic bronchoscopic aspirates. Collection and transport of uncontaminated specimens is crucial to the recovery of the causative agents. Evaluation of a Gram's stain of clinical material provides a guide to initial therapy. Pigmented and non-pigmented Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus species, and Bacteriodes species are the most commonly recovered anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections. Successful treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections requires a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical interventions. Routine susceptibility testing of recovered isolates is rarely warranted.
TI  - Identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free zone"(PFZ). METHODS: Seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, Prevotella nigrescens, and Actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. RESULTS: Secondary electron images showed that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the PFZ. Some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. By back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-P. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. Labeled cells with anti-C. rectus, anti-T. denticola and anti-P. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. A. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. A. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that P. gingivalis, C. rectus, T. denticola, P. nigrescens, and A. viscosus were present in the PFZ, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum involvement in adult periodontitis and possible modification of strain classification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This investigation was designed to evaluate the involvement of Fusobacterium nucleatum clinical strains in adult periodontitis by subspecies and expression of hemagglutination activity. METHODS: Forty-nine Fusobacterium strains were isolated from 40 sites in 40 subjects presenting with adult periodontitis. F. nucleatum subspecies identification was based on the electrophoretic migration of glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase. Hemagglutination activity and inhibition by galactose were tested on sheep erythrocytes. RESULTS: The 49 isolates belonged to the F. nucleatum species with a predominance of the nucleatum (34.7%) followed by the vincentii (26.5%) subspecies. In parallel, 71% of the strains belonging to the nucleatum subspecies were preferentially associated with Porphyromonas gingivalis. Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens detection was essentially correlated with identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies vincentii. No correlation was established between any particular subspecies and the pathogenicity factors tested (hemagglutination and production of short-chain fatty acids). On the other hand, significant predominance (65%, P= 0.017) of strongly hemagglutinating strains (titre > or =8 U) was observed in the sites where Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and/or Campylobacter rectus were not detected. These strains also showed higher butyric acid production. CONCLUSION: The importance of the adherence factors for Fusobacterium nucleatum strains and their multimodal aspect may indicate a higher pathogenicity or a higher involvement of certain strains and could lead to a classification of these strains, which is more closely related to their implication in the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) CFU/spot for aerobes and 10(5) CFU for anaerobes. The following are the MIC ranges and MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of ABT-773 for various isolates, respectively: Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other Pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; Eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. For anaerobes the MIC ranges and MIC(90)s of ABT-773 were as follows, respectively: Prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; Prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; Porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml; Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other Fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; Bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. ABT-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against S. aureus, E. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against F. nucleatum. The activity of ABT-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against Pasteurella spp., and ABT-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against Pasteurella spp. ABT-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.
TI  - Enhanced interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by LPS stimulated human monocytes isolated from HIV+ patients.
AB  - Periodontal disease and tooth loss is a common finding among advanced HIV+ patients. In addition to local oral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, systemic up-regulation of monocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion may also be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV disease. A study was undertaken to investigate IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha production by resting and LPS stimulated monocytes isolated from HIV+ patients and also to investigate the relationship of the patient's HIV viral load status to the cytokine production. Whole blood samples in EDTA were collected from 39 HIV-1 infected patients and 20 age and sex matched uninfected controls. Plasma was separated by centrifugation. Viral load was determined using a quantitative RT-PCR. Monocytes were isolated by Ficoll-hypaque gradient separation followed by overnight plastic adherence. Cultured monocytes (1x10(6)/ml) were stimulated with LPS (1 microg/ml) of either P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum for 2, 8, 24 and 48 h and supernatant fluids were collected. IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels in supernatant fluids were estimated by ELISA. Increased overall production of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by LPS stimulated monocytes isolated from HIV-1 infected patients was observed when compared to HIV-1 uninfected controls. LPS stimulated monocytes from HIV-1 infected patients with high viral load (HVL) produced significant (p<0.05) elevations in these pro-inflammatory cytokines when compared to HIV-1 uninfected controls. Both LPS of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum produced a comparable cytokine production by monocytes after 8 h of stimulation. These data suggest that enhanced IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha is produced by monocytes/macrophages isolated from HVL HIV+ patients and may be involved in the overall pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection.
TI  - Tetracycline fibres used to control bacterial infection during guided tissue regeneration (GTR).
AB  - AIMS: The colonization of suspected periodontal pathogens during the healing of periodontal defects treated by guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with e-PTFE membranes and tetracycline fibers was investigated. METHODS: Fifteen patients, each with one pair of angular periodontal bone defects of comparable size and morphology were recruited for the study. In a matched-pair study design, the test defects were treated with e-PTFE membranes in combination with tetracycline fibers, while control defects were treated with e-PTFE membranes alone. Microbiological specimens were taken from control as well as from test sites preoperatively (T0), intraoperatively (T1), two weeks after surgery (T2) and from membranes at time of removal (T3). Cultural methods were used to identify the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (Aa). RESULTS: At baseline and T1, none of the suspected periodontal pathogens were detected at test or control sites. Levels of P. intermedia and F. nucleatum, as mean percentages of total culturable microflora, were detected at levels significantly higher in control sites than test sites at times T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that e-PTFE membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal pathogens, and that bacterial colonization of healing sites after GTR procedures can be kept under control with a controlled delivery system releasing tetracycline.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections: an underestimated threat.
AB  - The involvement of fusobacteria in a wide range of human and animal infection has long been recognised. Slow-growing anaerobes, often in polymicrobial culture, they are not always identified but are present mainly in the oropharynx, from where they are bloodborne to other sites or aspirated into the lung. Fusobacterium nucleatum is commonly found in periodontal disease and produces tissue irritants such as butyric acid, proteases and cytokines. It has strong adhesive properties due to the presence of lectins, and these outer-membrane proteins mediate adhesion to epithelia and tooth surfaces, and coagglutination with other suspected pathogens. F. necrophorum may cause necrotising tonsillitis and septicaemia, leading to the spread of infection and the development of abscesses in the lung and brain--a form of Lemierre's syndrome. Calf diphtheria, foot rot and other infections in animals are well defined, with the pathogenic mechanisms involving leucotoxins, endotoxins and adhesins. A foul smell produced by butyric acid and other metabolic products is common to all fusobacterial infections. Identification using simple tests is within the scope of most laboratories.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  - We devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. In this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. Streptococcus constellatus and Peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (AF(50)) of S. constellatus and P. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (LD(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: AF(50)of P. oralis and F. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their LD(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. LD(50)of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. We conclude that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.
TI  - Interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  - Infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. Infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. However, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. To establish the relative importance of IL-1 and TNF in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to IL-1 (IL-1R1(-/-)), TNF (TNFRp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (TNFRp55(-/-)-IL-1RI(-/-)). The results indicate that IL-1 receptor signaling and TNF receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. However, IL-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than TNF receptor signaling in preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since IL-1R1(-/-) but not TNFRp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice have reduced bone destruction following mixed anaerobic infection.
AB  - C3H/HeJ mice have an impaired ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) due  to a mutation in the gene that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The effect of TLR4 deficiency on host responses to endodontic infections is unknown. In the present study, we compared periapical bone destruction, sepsis, and inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ and wild-type control C3H/HeOuJ mice. The mandibular first molars of both strains were subjected to pulpal exposure and infection with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius, and Peptostreptococcus micros. At sacrifice on day 21, TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice had significantly reduced periapical bone destruction compared to wild-type C3H/HeOuJ mice (P < 0.001). The decreased bone destruction in C3H/HeJ correlated with reduced expression of the bone resorptive cytokines interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) (P < 0.01) and IL-1beta (P < 0.05) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 (P < 0.05). No significant differences were seen in the levels of gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-10 between the two strains. The expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-12 were all significantly reduced in vitro in macrophages from both TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScNCr strains, compared to wild-type controls. Notably, the responses of TLR4-deficient macrophages to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were similarly reduced. Neither C3H/HeJ nor C3H/HeOuJ mice exhibited orofacial abscess development or infection dissemination as determined by splenomegaly or cachexia. We conclude that intact TLR function mediates increased proinflammatory responses and bone destruction in response to mixed anaerobic infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of MK-826 (L-749,345) against 363 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of MK-826 was compared to the activities of cefoxitin, ceftriaxone,  imipenem, and meropenem against 363 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes by using NCCLS procedures. At least 98% of the strains were susceptible to the carbapenems. All strains of Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus, and Sutterella wadsworthensis were susceptible to all agents tested.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  - In a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. Predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-Lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin Etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. At least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. Prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of 10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). No beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in Porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). All the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the Etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.
TI  - The periodontal abscess (I). Clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Little information is available regarding the diagnosis and microbiology of periodontal abscesses. The aim of this descriptive clinical and microbiological study was to provide more information in order to help in the characterisation of the periodontal abscess associated to periodontitis. METHOD: 29 consecutive patients with a periodontal abscess were studied by the assessment of clinical variables, including both subjective (pain, edema, redness and swelling) and objective (bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing pocket depth, tooth mobility and cervical lymphadenopathy) parameters. Microbiological samples were taken for anaerobic microbiology and processed by means of culture. Systemic involvement was also studied through the analysis of blood and urine samples using conventional laboratory standards. RESULTS: 62% of the abscesses affected untreated periodontitis patients, and 69% were associated with a molar tooth. More than 75% of the abscesses had moderate-severe scores related to edema, redness and swelling, and 90% of the patients reported pain. Bleeding occurred in all abscesses, while suppuration on sampling was detected in 66%. Mean associated pocket depth was 7.28 mm, and 79% of teeth presented some degree of mobility. Cervical lymphadenopathy was seen in 10% of patients, while elevated leucocyte counts were observed in 31.6%. The absolute number of neutrophils was elevated in 42% of the patients. High prevalences of putative periodontal pathogens were found, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Bacteroides forsythus. CONCLUSIONS: The periodontal abscess has clear clinical characteristics and is usually associated with severe periodontal destruction. This condition may cause systemic involvement and the lesion generally has a large bacterial mass with a high prevalence of well-recognised periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (C-HS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. The complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. METHODS: A 14-year-old male C-HS patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. Clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of C-HS. RESULTS: Laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. Bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. These granules and inclusions were characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. Bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque samples, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sp. Biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. Ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. Viable dividing bacteria were found in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of C-HS granulocyte deficiency. Periodontal treatment of these patients is often unsuccessful. This case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.
TI  - Influence of antimicrobial subinhibitory concentrations on hemolytic activity and bacteriocin-like substances in oral Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is considered for its role in colonization of initial and late microorganisms in dental plaque and for its coaggregation with other bacterial species. It is known that action of different antimicrobial substances may interfere with either virulence factors or with host-bacteria interaction. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of subinhibitory concentrations of chlorhexidine, triclosan, penicillin G and metronidazole on hemolytic activity and bacteriocin-like substance production of oral F. nucleatum. A high resistance to penicillin G was observed and 63% of the isolates were beta-lactamase positive. All the tested isolates were susceptible to metronidazole. F. nucleatum isolates grown with or without antimicrobials were alpha-hemolytics. Bacteriocin-like substance production was increased in isolates grown with penicillin G. Impaired production of hemolytic or antagonic substances can suggest a role in the regulation of oral microbiota.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus crista and human saliva on the viability of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.
AB  - Associations with facultative species might help planktonic oral anaerobes survive when they traverse saliva. This study investigated whether co-aggregation with Streptococcus crista ATCC 51110 enhanced the viability of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953. Two tubes each of co-aggregates and Fus. nucleatum ATCC 10953 alone were prepared. One of each set was resuspended in buffer, and the other in clarified saliva from each of 20 donors. After 1 h, cells were stained for viability. The median percentage of viable Fus. nucleatum ATCC 10953 in buffer with Strep. crista (86%) was significantly higher (p=0.04) than in buffer alone (77%). A similar trend was observed for saliva with Strep. crista (81%) and saliva alone (74%), although that difference was not significant (p=0.41). The median percentage of Fus. nucleatum co-aggregated in buffer (44%) was significantly reduced after incubation in saliva (16%) (p<0.0002). No such change was seen when saliva was replaced with purified salivary proline-rich glycoprotein, which can bind both species. For co-aggregate suspensions, there was no difference in the viability of fusobacteria that were or were not in direct contact with Strep. crista. In both cases, viability was significantly reduced in saliva relative to buffer. Strep. crista may enhance the viability of planktonic Fus. nucleatum ATCC 10953, but it is not yet clear whether that requires co-aggregation. Transmission of fusobacteria through saliva could depend on the interplay between protective factors, such as the presence of streptococci, and antimicrobial factors, which kill cells or disassociate co-aggregates.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide induces expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin S, in human cervical smooth-muscle cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaginal and amniotic infection with gram-negative bacteria is associated with preterm birth. We previously reported that human cervical smooth-muscle cells (CSMC) respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by expressing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. Our objective was to characterize the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli (E coli), Bacteroides fragilis, (B frag)and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nuc)on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin S, in human CSMC. METHODS: Human CSMC were exposed to LPS and the expression of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin S, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was analyzed by Northern blotting. The effect of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies on LPS-induced cathepsin S mRNA expression also was determined. RESULTS: E coli LPS increased expression of cathepsin S 12.5-fold after 12 hours; MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs also were increased 2.9- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL-1)alpha, and IL-1beta mRNAs were markedly up-regulated after 3 hours of LPS treatment. B frag and F nuc LPS also induced TNF-alpha and cathepsin S mRNAs. E coli LPS caused a sevenfold increase in TNF-alpha secretion after 5 to 8 hours. Antihuman TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, but not a monoclonal antibody to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, reduced the LPS-induced increase in cathepsin S mRNA by 27%, whereas neutralizing antibodies against IL-1alpha and IL-1beta did not suppress the response. Human CSMC were shown to express the toll-like receptor (TLR-2) and TLR-4 genes, which mediate the action of LPS. TLR-2 mRNA was up-regulated by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: CSMC respond to LPS with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin S. Increases in cathepsin S mRNA result only in part from the rapid induction of TNF-alpha gene expression. TNF-alpha may also augment the CSMC response to LPS by increasing expression of the LPS signaling receptor, TLR-2, which probably directly mediates LPS action. These observations provide a mechanism by which gram-negative bacteria can precipitate cervical changes associated with preterm birth.
TI  - In vitro activity of rifaximin, metronidazole and vancomycin against Clostridium  difficile and the rate of selection of spontaneously resistant mutants against representative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, including ammonia-producing species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative characterized by a wide antibacterial activity. This drug is neither absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract nor inactivated by gastric juices, and exerts its action entirely within the intestinal lumen. METHODS: In this study, the activity of this antibiotic was compared with that of metronidazole and vancomycin against 93 Clostridium difficile isolates. The rate of emergence of bacteria spontaneously resistant to the new compound was also evaluated in relation to representative gram-positive and gram-negative strains. In terms of MIC(50) values, rifaximin showed an intrinsic activity superior to that of the other agents. The emergence of spontaneously resistant strains was assessed with 46 aerobic (staphylococci, enterococci, Proteus spp., Citrobacter freundii, Providencia rettgeri, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, enterotoxigenic and entero- hemorrhagic Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enteritidis) and anaerobic (Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptococcus spp.) pathogens, most of them also ammonium producers. Two different methods, broth and agar dilution, were employed. RESULTS: When liquid medium was employed, bacteria capable of sustained growth in 100 microg/ml of rifaximin were obtained after 2-5 transfers with gram-positive aerobic cocci, 2-3 transfers with gram-negative aerobic strains and 2-5 transfers with anaerobic species. At the highest dose used with the agar dilution method (8 x MIC), the frequency of emergence of spontaneously resistant mutants ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.6 x 10(-8) with gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci, while with aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, this value ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.7 x 10(-7). C. difficile showed a particularly low incidence of spontaneously resistant mutants (<1 x 10(-9)). The low incidence of resistant subpopulations selected by levels of 8 x MIC of rifaximin suggests that the high levels of the drug which were reached in the gastrointestinal lumen may further prevent the selection of mutants. CONCLUSION: The low toxicity, broad antibacterial activity and very poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract of rifaximin suggest a potential therapeutic use for this drug in gastrointestinal diseases, as well as in the management of patients with cirrhosis and chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy.
TI  - Identification of Candida dubliniensis in a study of HIV-seropositive pediatric dental patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: The combination of an immature immune system and suppressed cellular immunity in children with HIV infections provides optimal conditions for rapid disease progression. As a result, pediatric AIDS has become a major epidemiological challenge. Oral fungal colonization remains one of the most common opportunistic infections observed in both adult and pediatric HIV infected patients. Although Candida albicans is the most frequently isolated opportunistic fungal species, a recently characterized Candida species, C. dubliniensis, has gained considerable attention due to its almost exclusive association with HIV-seropositive individuals. The purpose of this study was to prospectively screen for the presence of C. dubliniensis among pediatric HIV+ patients. METHODS: Oral samples taken from twenty-seven children were cultured for the presence of yeast. All positive yeast isolates obtained were screened for the presence of C. dubliniensis by use of tests for germ tube and chlamydospore production, detection of inability to grow at 45 degrees C, by colony color on CHROMagar Candida medium, coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 49256 and by the results of sugar assimilation testing with the API 20C AUX yeast identification system. RESULTS: Among the 27 patients tested, 3 patients were found to harbor C. dubliniensis, one of which also grew C. glabrata; 12 patients were colonized with C. albicans, while the remaining 12 patients were negative for yeast. Identification of the three C. dubliniensis isolates was genetically confirmed by electrophoretic karyotyping. All three C. dubliniensis isolates were found to be susceptible to fluconazole (MIC < or = 0.25 ug/ml). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the presence of this novel species in a dental pediatric HIV seropositive population and support the need for further investigation into the prevalence and pathogenesis of C. dubliniensis.
TI  - The Fusobacterium nucleatum porin FomA possesses the general topology of the non-specific porins.
AB  - FomA is a major non-specific porin of Fusobacterium nucleatum with no sequence similarity to other known porins. According to the topology model, the protein consists of 16 transmembrane beta-strands, connected by eight surface-exposed loops and seven periplasmic turns. In this study, the insertion mutagenesis approach was applied to probe the topology model. A Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) epitope was successfully inserted at 11 different sites of the FomA protein and a 6-aa insertion was successfully inserted at two different sites. Correct folding of the mutant proteins and proper incorporation into the outer membrane were assessed by heat modifiability and by an in vivo porin activity assay. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of intact cells, using mAbs directed against the inserted SFV epitope, revealed that three of the eight putative extracellular loops are indeed surface-exposed. Trypsin accessibility experiments confirmed the cell surface exposure of two additional loops. The results support the proposed topology model, showing that FomA possesses the general beta-barrel topology of the non-specific porins, with the interesting exception that the third loop does not seem to fulfil the role of a constriction loop.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacteria in English HIV-seropositive persons.
AB  - Selected periodontopathic bacteria were sought in 20 HIV-infected English patients and eight noninfected control subjects with similar periodontal status, using highly specific DNA probes. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. a), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently detected and were found at higher levels in HIV-infected individuals than in controls. Significantly increased levels of Treponema denticola but, in contrast, lower levels of Eikenella corrodens were found in nonbleeding sites of HIV-infected patients compared with controls. The results of the present investigation on English patients suggest a periodontopathogenic role for A. a, P. gingivalis and C. rectus, and possibly P. intermedia and are in general accord with most previously reported data from the United States. Longitudinal studies are now required to determine more precisely the association between periodontopathic microflora, immune competence and periodontal health and disease in HIV-infected persons.
TI  - Retrospective identification and characterization of Candida dubliniensis isolates among Candida albicans clinical laboratory isolates from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and non-HIV-infected individuals.
AB  - Fungal opportunistic infections, and in particular those caused by the various Candida species, have gained considerable significance as a cause of morbidity and, often, mortality. The newly described species Candida dubliniensis phenotypically resembles Candida albicans so closely that it is easily misidentified as such. The present study was designed to determine the frequency at which this new species is not recognized in the clinical laboratory, to determine the patient populations with which C. dubliniensis is associated, to determine colonization versus infection frequency, and to assess fluconazole resistance. Over a 2-year period, 1,251 isolates that were initially identified as C. albicans by a hospital clinical laboratory were reevaluated for C. dubliniensis by inability to grow at 45 degrees C, colony color on CHROMagar Candida medium, coaggregation assay with Fusobacterium nucleatum, and sugar assimilation profiles (API 20C AUX yeast identification system). A total of 15 (1.2%) isolates from 12 patients were identified as C. dubliniensis. Ten of the patients were found to be immunocompromised (these included patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection or AIDS, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, and patients awaiting transplantation). Thirteen isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole (MIC, <0.5 microgram/ml). Three isolates from one patient, genotypically confirmed as the same strain, showed variable susceptibility to fluconazole. The first isolate was susceptible, whereas the other two isolates were dose-dependent susceptible (MIC, 16.0 microgram/ml). These data confirm the close association of C. dubliniensis with immunocompromised states and that increased fluconazole MICs may develop in vivo. This study emphasizes the importance of screening germ-tube-positive yeasts for the inability to grow at 45 degrees C followed by confirmatory tests in order to properly identify this species.
TI  - The response to oxidative stress of Fusobacterium nucleatum grown in continuous culture.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 was grown in continuous culture and the atmosphere changed stepwise from nitrogen (anaerobiosis) to a mixture of air: oxygen (40:60). No significant differences in biomass were observed and the baseline low level of superoxide dismutase increased only slightly; catalase and peroxidase activities were never detected but the level of NADH oxidase increased more than three-fold when oxygen was introduced into the system. In relation to acidic end-products, the relative proportion of acetate increased while that of butyrate decreased. Due mainly, it would seem, to NADH oxidase activity, the culture maintained a low redox potential (E(h)=-274 mV) even under an atmosphere of 40% oxygen in air and dissolved oxygen was not detected. This may, in part, explain the protective role of F. nucleatum for anaerobes in both biofilm and planktonic phases of aerated, mixed cultures of oral bacteria.
TI  - Review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. The studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. Using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against Gram-positive anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens, all Peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against Gram-negative anaerobes. Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides tectum and many Bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/L, while the other species of the B. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. Species variability was evident: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas macaccae, Prevotella heparinolytica and Prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/L of gemifloxacin while most other Porphyromonas and Prevotella spp. were not. These data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which Gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. may predominate.
TI  - Interactions between periodontal bacteria and human oral epithelial cells: Fusobacterium nucleatum adheres to and invades epithelial cells.
AB  - Bacteria are causative agents of periodontal diseases. Interactions between oral  bacteria and gingival epithelial cells are essential aspects of periodontal infections. Using an in vitro tissue culture model, a selected group of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria frequently associated with periodontal diseases, including Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter curvus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia, were examined for their ability to adhere to and invade primary cultures of human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC). The effects of these bacteria on the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a proinflammatory chemokine, were also measured. These studies provided an initial demonstration that F. nucleatum adhered to and invaded HGEC and that this was accompanied by high levels of IL-8 secretion from the epithelial cells. The attachment and invasion characteristics of F. nucleatum were also tested using KB cells, an oral epithelial cell line. The invasion was verified by transmission electron microscopy and with metabolic inhibitors. Invasion appeared to occur via a "zipping" mechanism and required the involvement of actins, microtubules, signal transduction, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism of the epithelial cell, as well as protein synthesis by F. nucleatum. A spontaneous mutant, lam, of F. nucleatum, isolated as defective in autoagglutination, was unable to attach to or invade HGEC or KB cells, further indicating the requirement of bacterial components in these processes. Sugar inhibition assays indicated that lectin-like interactions were involved in the attachment of F. nucleatum to KB cells. Investigation of these new virulence phenotypes should improve our understanding of the role of F. nucleatum in periodontal infections.
TI  - The prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. The overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. The prevalence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, and Treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using DNA probes. METHODS: The subjects were 21 to 35 years of age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. The test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. RESULTS: This investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2) of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (P= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by Fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
AB  - Human gingival epithelial cells (HGE) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) and hBD-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. In the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hBD-2 was examined. HBD-2 mRNA was induced by cell wall extract of Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. HBD-2 mRNA was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an epithelial cell activator. HBD-2 mRNA was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed gingival tissue samples. HBD-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in HGE stimulated with F. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mRNA by this stimulant. Kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hBD-2 mRNA; TNF-alpha and F. nucleatum cell wall induced hBD-2 mRNA rapidly (2 to 4 h), while PMA stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). In contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) within 1 h. The role of TNF-alpha as an intermediary in F. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-TNF-alpha that did not inhibit hBD-2 induction. However, inhibitor studies show that F. nucleatum stimulation of hBD-2 mRNA requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from Escherichia coli and F. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hBD-2, although they up-regulated IL-8 mRNA. Collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hBD-2 mRNA via multiple pathways in HGE in a pattern that is distinct from that of IL-8 expression. We suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.
TI  - Bacterial colonisation during GTR treatment. A longitudinal analysis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term biological and clinical effects of a controlled delivery system releasing tetracyclines during the healing of interproximal periodontal defects treated by the technique of guided tissue regeneration (GTR) using e-PTFE membranes. METHODS: Fifteen patients, each with two comparable interproximal periodontal defects, underwent surgical treatment with e-PTFE membranes in conjunction with tetracycline fibres at the test site and e-PTFE membranes alone at the control site. Microbiological specimens were taken from each site treated at baseline (T0) and one year after surgery (T4). Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), pocket depth at probing (PD) and attachment level at probing (PAL) were recorded at baseline (T0) and one year after surgery (T4). The presence of selected pathogenic microbial species, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium Nucleatum (Fn) and Actinobaccillus Actinomicetemcomitans (Aa), was investigated and these species were identified by cultural methods. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the level of periodontal pathogens was detected between the test and control sites at time T4. Likewise, no significant clinical difference between the test site and the control site was detected at time T4. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that tetracycline fibres used in conjunction with e-PTFE membranes do not provide and further clinical and microbiological improvement or effect the healing of periodontal defects one year after GTR treatment.
TI  - Development of oral bacterial flora in young children.
AB  - The intimate relationship with bacteria is a fundamental factor in the health status of an individual. After birth infants are exposed to continuous person-to-person and environmental contacts with microbes, and the development of the indigenous microflora begins on the surfaces of the human body. In a developing ecosystem microbial colonization may easily occur because of the still inadequate host response. Adhesion is the initial event in the colonization of bacteria. In the mouth, only mucosal surfaces are available during the first months of life. After teeth emerge, the number of attachment sites and potential niches increases significantly. Bacteria adhere not only to oral surfaces but also to each other, forming multigeneric communities where specific partner relationships influence their composition and stability. Viridans streptococci and a strictly anaerobic species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, are of interest in this context. The oral colonization pattern differs between individuals already in infancy; variable bacterial load in saliva of attendants and other close contacts and the frequency of this bacterial exposure may partly account for individual differences. In addition, the exposure of an infant to antibiotics affects the quality of colonizing bacteria. This article presents an overview of the age-related acquisition of oral bacteria and the role of the indigenous oral microflora in health and disease.
TI  - Development of a clindamycin-impregnated fiber as an intracanal medication in endodontic therapy.
AB  - The effectiveness of traditional endodontic intracanal medications in reducing bacterial numbers and preventing acute flare-ups and pain continues to be questioned. In the present study, a new local delivery device was developed that releases a substantive dose of clindamycin into root canals. Clindamycin-impregnated ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) fibers were produced, and the sensitivity of common endodontic microbes to the fibers were established. An in vitro model was developed to persistently infect 32 extracted human teeth with endodontic pathogens to test the efficacy of the clindamycin/EVA fibers in reducing the number of colony-forming units. The clindamycin/EVA fibers were shown to be effective in reducing growth of common endodontic microbes on blood agar plates, and in significantly reducing growth of Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedius in extracted human teeth, thus indicating merit in further exploring the potential of these fibers as intracanal medications.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide from endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  - We examined the induction of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from several species of possible endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria. Studies were conducted in human whole blood cultures from six patients (two from each group) with differing numbers of periapical periodontitis lesions (i.e. patients with radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high-lesion group, n = 4), in one or two teeth (low-lesion group, n = 6), and six healthy volunteers with no periapical lesions (no lesion group)). LPS from Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, and Prophyromonas endodontalis ATCC 27067 induced a higher IL-8 response in the subjects of the high-lesion group, compared with the subjects of the other two groups. To ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the subjects to different bacterial species. LPS from P. gingivalis reacted strongly with sera from the high-lesion group. Thus, LPS from black-pigmented bacteria may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing particular cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.
TI  - Induction of apoptotic cell death in peripheral blood mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells by an oral bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - It is largely unknown why a variety of bacteria present in the oral cavity are capable of establishing themselves in the periodontal pockets of nonimmunocompromised individuals in the presence of competent immune effector cells. In this paper we present evidence for the immunosuppressive role of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative oral bacterium which plays an important role in the generation of periodontal disease. Our studies indicate that the immunosuppressive role of F. nucleatum is largely due to the ability of this organism to induce apoptotic cell death in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). F. nucleatum treatment induced apoptosis of PBMCs and PMNs as assessed by an increase in subdiploid DNA content determined by DNA fragmentation and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling assays. The ability of F. nucleatum to induce apoptosis was abolished by either heat treatment or proteinase digestion but was retained after formaldehyde treatment, suggesting that a heat-labile surface protein component is responsible for bacterium-mediated cell apoptosis. The data also indicated that F. nucleatum-induced cell apoptosis requires activation of caspases and is protected by NF-kappaB. Possible mechanisms of F. nucleatum's role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease are discussed.
TI  - Isolation of fusobacteria from the oral cavities of malnourished Nigerian children living in agricultural and herding villages.
AB  - A previous study demonstrated the presence and possible involvement of Fusobacterium necrophorum in the pathogenesis of noma lesions of children living in agricultural and herding villages in northwestern Nigeria. In order to determine if F. necrophorum was part of the oral flora of malnourished children with no noma lesions, a study of the fusobacteria present in the oral cavities of 30 children, 2-6 years of age in Sokoto State, was undertaken. Swabs taken of the oral cavity were cultured on selective fusobacteria medium using conventional anaerobic microbiological techniques. F. nucleatum was recovered from each child and F. necrophorum was isolated from the oral cavity of only one child. The presence of F. nucleatum and the lack of F. necrophorum, except in one case, suggests that the latter is not normal flora in the children at risk for noma. F. necrophorum, a putative trigger organism for noma may gain a foothold only when certain staging conditions (i.e., lowered host resistance and/or oral lesion) are present.
TI  - Beta-lactamases producing anaerobic bacteria in dentoalveolar abscesses.
AB  - Pus samples of 30 patients with closed dentoalveolar abscesses who had not received antimicrobial therapy for at last two months were screened for the presence of beta-lactamase-producing anaerobic bacteria. From these 30 pus samples, a total of 112 bacterial strains were isolated; 83 of them were strict anaerobes and 29 were aerobes. beta-lactamases activity of the selected anaerobic bacteria was tested after identification of the isolates and was detected in 5 of the total 83 (6%) strict anaerobic isolates, whereas these 5 strains were isolated in 4 of the 30 (13.3%) pus samples. The species with beta-lactamase activity were in the Prevotella intermedia (4 from 14 isolates) and the Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 from 9 isolates) groups. None of the gram-positive and the other gram-negative anaerobic strains were beta-lactamase positive.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a human neutrophil aggregation defective mutant of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is known to adhere to human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and cause them to aggregate. In this study, we isolated a spontaneously occurring aggregation defective (AGG(-)) mutant and this mutant will be used for future study of the interactions between this bacterium and human PMN. Genomic DNA fingerprinting by random-primed polymerase chain reaction method revealed a difference between the parent strain and the AGG(-) mutant. This mutant also showed an altered phenotype in both microbicidal and phagocytic assays, suggesting that the bacterial factor involved in the aggregation may also be very important for the phagocytosis and, subsequently, the killing by human PMNs. Further study of this mutant may help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between this pathogen and human PMNs.
TI  - The effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previously, we reported that SRP resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of Bacteroidesforsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola at 3 and 6 months post-SRP in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects were monitored at 9 and 12 months. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of SRP in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. METHOD: Clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to SRP and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. Each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. Differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The Quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. RESULTS: Mean pocket depth (mm+/-SEM) decreased from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). Mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. Bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and T. denticola decreased in prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels at 9 and 12 months. Significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at 12 months for Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, Streptococcus mitis, Capnocytophaga sp, and Veillonella parvula. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.
TI  - Native plasmids of Fusobacterium nucleatum: characterization and use in development of genetic systems.
AB  - Three native plasmids of Fusobacterium nucleatum were characterized, including DNA sequence analysis of one plasmid, pFN1. A shuttle plasmid, pHS17, capable of transforming Escherichia coli and F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 was constructed with pFN1. pHS17 was stably maintained in the F. nucleatum transformants, and differences in the transformation efficiencies suggested the presence of a restriction-modification system in F. nucleatum.
TI  - In vitro volatile sulfur compound production of oral bacteria in different culture media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to detect the relative contribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia in the production of oral malodor. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The volatile sulfur compounds produced by these bacteria in vitro were measured semiquantitatively by a portable sulfide monitor. RESULTS: Samples from the tongue, tonsils, and pharynx showed a significantly higher production (550 ppb) of volatile sulfur compounds during the first 6 hours after anaerobic incubation in broths (brain-heart infusion, Columbia, and Trypticase Soy) than after incubation in agar media (300 ppb) (P < 0.001). After 24 hours, values in broths and agars leveled off at 350 ppb (P = 0.3) and remained constant during the next 6 days. Measurement of separate pure cultures showed that maximal volatile sulfur compound production was reached 6 hours after incubation (450 ppb for the 3 bacteria). Higher volatile sulfur compound values were measured in brain-heart infusion. When measurements of mixed cultures of the 3 pathogens were performed every 15 minutes, the maximal value was reached after only 30 minutes of incubation (nearly 500 ppb). CONCLUSION: The in vitro volatile sulfur compound production of oral samples is preferably measured in broths. Maximal sulfur production from mixed cultures is reached after 30 minutes of incubation. Samples should always be inoculated at the same dilution.
TI  - Comparing periodontal disease in identical twins: a case report.
AB  - Previous investigators have shown that numerous environmental and genetic variables may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. This case report presents clinical and laboratory findings of a set of Caucasian female identical twins. One patient presented clinically with mild gingivitis and no clinical or radiographic signs of periodontitis. The other exhibited gingivitis with localized, moderate-to-severe periodontitis. Neither patient reported a history of systemic conditions that might influence their periodontal health, and neither presented other known risk factors, such as tobacco use. The only apparent variable was related to their oral hygiene. The periodontally involved patient exhibited higher plaque scores than her twin in all clinical visits. Subgingival plaque cultures revealed the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus only in the diseased twin. Both patients had low colony counts of Prevotella intermedia and Eikenella corrodens, but only the healthy twin harbored small quantities of Fusobacterium nucleatum. This case report offers an opportunity to assess etiology of periodontitis in two genetically identical patients whose only obvious difference was their oral hygiene.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus micros coaggregates with Fusobacterium nucleatum and non-encapsulated Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Coaggregation is one of the potential colonization strategies of oral microorganisms, often involving fimbrial structures in the interactions. In this study, the coaggregation characteristics of the rough and smooth genotypes of the periodontal pathogen Peptostreptococcus micros were compared to investigate the role of the fibril-like structures of the rough genotype in coaggregation. Of the 11 oral species tested, only Fusobacterium nucleatum strains and non-encapsulated Porphyromonas gingivalis strains coaggregated with P. micros. No differences in coaggregation between the smooth type (Sm), the rough type (Rg) and the smooth variant of the Rg type (Rg(Sm)) of P. micros were observed. Heat-stable, periodate-sensitive structures on P. micros appeared to interact with heat- and protease-sensitive structures on F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. These data indicate that these unimodal coaggregations are not mediated by the proteinaceous fibril-like structures of the Rg genotype, but by carbohydrates present on both genotypes of P. micros.
TI  - Pre- and post-implantation microbiota of the tongue, teeth, and newly placed implants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This investigation sought intra-oral sources of species colonizing dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plaque samples were taken pre- and post-successful osseointegration from implants, teeth, and from tongues of 10 edentulous and 11 partially dentate subjects. Samples were assayed using whole genomic DNA probes in a checkerboard assay to 42 subgingival species. RESULTS: Similar prevalences and mean levels (10(3) to 10(4)) of microorganisms colonized implants and teeth. Species levels from tongue samples were higher than those of teeth and implants, although species prevalence was similar, suggesting that larger samples were obtained from the tongue. No significant differences were observed between the microbiota from the tongue of edentulous and partially dentate subjects. Most implant species were detected on tongue pre-implantation. In individual edentulous subjects, there were positive associations between Capnocytophaga ochracea and Campylobacter rectus from tongue and implant samples. In individual partially dentate subjects, there were positive associations between Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii from tongue and implant samples, and Treponema denticola from implant and tooth samples taken at the same visit. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the tongue, in addition to teeth, can be a source for species colonizing new implants.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum empyema necessitans.
AB  
TI  - Longitudinal study of dental implants in a periodontally compromised population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine the clinical  status and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of dental implants and natural teeth in patients with a history of periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty-five partially edentulous patients treated for moderate to advanced adult periodontitis and having a total of 42 implants participated in this 3-year study. The assessment of clinical status was done 1, 2, and 3 years after prosthetic loading (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). Clinical parameters evaluated included probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI). The subgingival microbiota at peri-implant and periodontal sites were analyzed at T1 and T2. RESULTS: No significant difference in clinical parameters between implants and teeth and within the 2 groups between different time points was observed through the study. PD and CAL measurements of sampled periodontal and peri-implant sites did not show any statistically significant difference through the study and between the 2 groups. PI of sampled periodontal sites showed a statistically significant improvement during the study. From the morphological observation of the subgingival microbiota, a significant difference in the composition of motile rods between implants and teeth was found at T1. There were no differences detected in the subgingival microbiota, culturally identified at peri-implant and periodontal sites for the duration of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, implants were colonized by the indigenous periodontal microbiota and were well maintained in patients with a history of periodontitis. No significant association between progressing or non-progressing periodontal or peri-implant sampled sites in terms of loss of attachment and infection with at least one of the searched periodontal pathogens was found, suggesting that the presence of putative periodontopathogens at peri-implant and periodontal sites may not be associated with future attachment loss or implant failure.
TI  - Acquisition of plasmin activity by Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and potential contribution to tissue destruction during periodontitis.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum has been associated with a variety of oral and nonoral infections such as periodontitis, pericarditis, bone infections, and brain abscesses. Several studies have shown the role of plasmin, a plasma serine protease, in increasing the invasive capacity of microorganisms. In this study, we investigated the binding of human plasminogen to F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and its subsequent activation into plasmin. Plasminogen-binding activity of bacterial cells was demonstrated by a solid-phase dot blot assay using an anti-plasminogen antibody. The binding activity was heat resistant and involved cell-surface lysine residues since it was abolished in the presence of the lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Activation of plasminogen-coated bacteria occurred following incubation with either streptokinase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), or a Porphyromonas gingivalis culture supernatant. In the case of the P. gingivalis culture supernatant, a cysteine protease was likely involved in the activation. The plasmin activity generated on the cell surface of F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum could be inhibited by aprotinin. Activation of plasminogen by u-PA was greatly enhanced when plasminogen was bound to bacteria rather than in a free soluble form. u-PA-activated plasminogen-coated F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum was found to degrade fibronectin, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was also degraded by the plasmin activity generated on the bacterial cells. This study suggests a possible role for plasminogen, which is present in affected periodontal sites, in promoting tissue destruction and invasion by nonproteolytic bacteria such as F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum.
TI  - Nosocomial sinusitis with isolation of anaerobic bacteria in ICU patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and the eventual clinical characteristics of nosocomial sinusitis with anaerobic bacteria isolation in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A 12-bed medical ICU in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 30 adult patients with documented nosocomial maxillary sinusitis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using appropriate microbiological techniques, 33 anaerobic bacterial strains were isolated in 18/30 patients (60 %) with nosocomial sinusitis. Anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 13 patients (72 %), whereas in 5 patients (28 %) only anaerobic strains were isolated in sinus puncture cultures. The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella sp. (n = 20, 60 %) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 5, 15 %). The production of beta -lactamase was demonstrated in 13/27 gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. All patients in whom anaerobic bacteria were isolated from transnasal punctures had had a nasogastric tube. Patients in whom anaerobic bacteria were isolated more frequently had neurological disorders upon admission (p < 0.02). Ten patients (30 %) had nosocomial pneumonia, 8 of whom had at least one identical strain in both lung and sinus cultures, including 2 patients with anaerobic bacteria isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Using appropriate microbiological techniques, anaerobic bacteria were frequently isolated in nosocomial sinusitis. If necessary, the empirical choice of antimicrobial therapy in patients with nosocomial sinusitis should take into account these results.
TI  - Enhanced interleukin-8 production in THP-1 human monocytic cells by lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
AB  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been used to assist in bone marrow recovery during cancer chemotherapy. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays an important role in macrophage mediated inflammatory processes including exacerbation of periodontal diseases, one of the most common complications in GM-CSF receiving cancer patients. The effect of GM-CSF supplementation on IL-8 production was investigated in a human monocyte cell line THP-1, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide extracted from two oral microorganisms, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Resting THP-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum and/or GM-CSF (50 IU/ml) for varying time periods. The production of IL-8 in THP-1 cells was measured by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A very low level of the cytokine IL-8 was produced constitutive in THP-1 cells. Starting from 8 h of treatment and afterwards GM-CSF alone significantly increased IL-8 production in THP-1 cells. Lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) extracts from either F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis amplified IL-8 production 500-800 times in comparison to resting THP-1 cells. When lipopolysaccharide of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis was supplemented with 50 IU/ml of GM-CSF, there was a statistically significant enhanced production of IL-8 by THP-1 cells after 1 day to 7 days of treatment as compared with lipopolysaccharide treatment alone. GM-CSF (50 IU/ml) also significantly increased IL-8 production from 2-7 days of treatment of THP-1 cells when supplemented with a positive control, phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA), as compared to PMA treatment alone. These investigations using the in vitro THP-1 human monocyte cell model indicate that there may be an increase in the response on a cellular level to oral endotoxin following GM-CSF therapy as evidenced by enhanced production of the tissue-reactive inflammatory cytokine, IL-8.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in an intravenous drug abuser.
AB  - Infective endocarditis due to anaerobic non-spore-forming gram-negative bacilli in intravenous drug abusers is exceedingly rare, with only two cases being previously reported in the literature. A case of endocarditis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in an intravenous drug abuser is reported, accompanied by a review of the literature.
TI  - Arbitrarily primed-polymerase chain reaction for identification and epidemiologic subtyping of oral isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum is the most frequently isolated bacterium in  periodontal disease and plays an important role in serious infections in other parts of the body. Arbitrarily primed-polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) was used to construct primers for specific identification and subtyping of F. nucleatum. Subtypes may differ in virulence and, hence, are important as periodontal pathogens. Subtypes also may differ in antibiotic susceptibility; therefore, knowing the subtypes may influence choice of treatment. METHODS: We analyzed 70 DNA samples of F. nucleatum isolated from patients with periodontal disease (PD) (N = 32) or AIDS-related PD (N = 8) and from healthy carriers (N = 30). From 90 AP-PCR primers screened, five amplification products were selected, cloned in pCR II vector, and sequenced. These sequences were used to design new pairs of specific primers. Sequences were compared to GenBank entries with BLAST and showed no significant matches. RESULTS: Three primer pairs produced bands of approximately 1 Kb (primer 5059S) or 0.5 Kb (primers FN5047 or M1211) with all F. nucleatum DNAs tested. PCR amplification using primer pair M8171 produced a 1 Kb band with isolates from 7 (22%) PD and 5 (63%) PD-AIDS patients and 9 (30%) healthy controls. Using the same primer pair, 2 other bands of approximately 0.5 Kb and 0.4 Kb were observed with DNA from isolates from 2 (6%) PD and all PD-AIDS patients, but were not observed with DNA samples from healthy controls (P<0.0001). All the primer pairs produced no or different amplicon profiles with DNA samples from bacterial species other than F. nucleatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PCR primer pairs 5059S, FN5047 or M1211 can be used to specifically identify F. nucleatum isolates and distinguish them from other bacteria. The primer pair M8171 could also be used to differentiate F. nucleatum isolated from periodontal patients or healthy individuals. These specific primers can be used in PCR analysis for specific identification of F. nucleatum and to distinguish it from other bacteria associated with human periodontitis. These approaches appear promising in facilitating laboratory identification, molecular subtyping, and taxonomy of putative periodontopathogens.
TI  - Dexamethasone differentially regulates cytokine transcription and translation in  macrophages responding to bacteria or okadaic acid.
AB  - Many microorganisms and microbial products induce expression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in macrophages, primarily by transcriptional activation. We show here, by using mouse macrophages in primary culture, that pre-treatment with dexamethasone inhibits bacteria-induced IL-1beta expression as mRNA and cellular pro-IL-1beta in parallel, consistent with an effect primarily on transcriptional activation. In contrast, the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was only partly inhibited despite virtually complete inhibition of TNF-alpha protein formation. Furthermore, the selective induction of primarily cell-associated 26,000 M, pro-TNF-alpha by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also was partly inhibited at the mRNA level by dexamethasone, whereas additional translational inhibition appeared to be lacking. This latter finding is reminiscent of earlier findings regarding signalling to activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which is sensitive to dexamethasone when elicited by bacteria, but not when elicited by okadaic acid. The present results raise the possibility that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on TNF-alpha translation, but not on transcriptional activation, is mediated by one or more okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Utilization of D-amino acids by Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium varium.
AB  - The utilization of D- and L-amino acids with acidic, basic or polar side chains was demonstrated by HPLC. Two species of the anaerobe Fusobacterium utilized D-lysine and the L isomers of glutamate, glutamine, histidine, lysine and serine. Only F. varium used L-arginine, D-glutamate and D-serine as substrates, whereas F. nucleatum specifically utilized D-histidine and D-glutamine. D-Glutamate accumulated in F. nucleatum cultures supplemented with D-glutamine, and ornithine was detected when either DL- or L-arginine was included in F. varium cultures. Based on literature precedents, D-glutamate and D-histidine are isomerized to their L isomers prior to degradation, but separate catabolic pathways are possible for each enantiomer of lysine and serine.
TI  - Establishment of oral anaerobes during the first year of life.
AB  - Anaerobic species constitute a significant part of the bacterial community of the mouth. Although the time and species involved in the primary colonization of infants are of great importance by forming the basis for further colonization, the development of the oral anaerobic microflora with age is still inadequately understood. In the present study, time and succession of colonization of oral anaerobes were longitudinally examined in 44 healthy Caucasian infants at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. Unstimulated saliva samples were quantitatively cultured on non-selective Brucella blood agar and several selective media for the isolation of anaerobic micro-organisms. The most frequent anaerobic finding in two-month-old infants was Veillonella spp. The Prevotella melaninogenica group also represented early colonizing species, and the frequency increased remarkably during the first year of life, whereas the Prevotella intermedia group organisms seemed to be late colonizers. Fusobacterium nucleatum, non-pigmented Prevotella spp., and Porphyromonas catoniae were occasional findings in subjects at 2 months but frequent findings in those at one year of age. F. nucleatum was the most frequent strictly anaerobic species in one-year-old infants; other fusobacteria were also occasionally found. The frequency of facultative/micro-aerophilic corroding rods and Capnocytophaga spp. started to increase toward the end of the first year. Except for the common presence of facultative/micro-aerophilic Actinomyces spp., other anaerobic gram-positive species were only occasionally present in these infants. Once established, early-colonizing species tended to persist in the mouth. Our longitudinal study demonstrated the establishment of several anaerobic species with steadily increasing frequencies during the first year of life.
TI  - 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum.
AB  - Component D (HgdAB) of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum was purified to homogeneity. It is able to use component A from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC) to initiate catalysis together with ATP, Mg2+ and a strong reducing agent such as Ti(III)citrate. Component D from C. symbiosum has a 6 x higher specific activity compared with that from A. fermentans and contains a second [4Fe-4S] cluster but the same amount of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (1.0 per heterodimeric enzyme, m = 100 kDa). Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed symmetric cube-type structures of the two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. EPR spectroscopy showed the resistance of the clusters to reducing agents, but detected a sharp signal at g = 2. 004 probably due to a stabilized flavin semiquinone. Three genes from C. symbiosum coding for components D (hgdA and hgdB) and A (hgdC) were cloned and sequenced. Primer extension experiments indicated that the genes are transcribed in the order hgdCAB from an operon only half the size of that from A. fermentans. Sequence comparisons detected a close relationship to the dehydratase system from A. fermentans and HgdA from Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as to putative proteins of unknown function from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Lower, but significant, identities were found with putative enzymes from several methanogenic Archaea and Escherichia coli, as well as with the mechanistically related benzoyl-CoA reductases from the Proteobacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Thauera aromatica.
TI  - Microbiological features of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - Papillon-Lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. The syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. This report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. Clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. In samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr type 1 virus by a nested-PCR detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. Major cultivable bacteria included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), Prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and Peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Eikenella corrodens were identified by PCR analysis. The patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not A. actinomycetemcomitans. The viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the Papillon-Lefevre syndrome patient. The father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but not Epstein-Barr type 1 virus. We hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with A. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
TI  - Primary psoas abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A case of primary pyogenic psoas abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum is described. Clinicians must maintain a high index of clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of psoas abscess. Although Staphylococcus aureus accounts for most cases of primary psoas abscess, this report emphasizes the importance of bacteriological confirmation of the microorganism involved.
TI  - Microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. Recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with scaling and root planing. METHODS: The study was conducted in a split-mouth design. Thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microIU in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. Subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. A. actino-mycetemcomitans, C. rectus, B. forsythus, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and P. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or PCR technique. RESULTS: There was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. The prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis and the mean proportions of C. rectus, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. Besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - The effects of HIV viral load on the phagocytic activity of monocytes activated with lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine whether viral load status in HIV+ patients has any potential effect on monocyte phagocytic function both before and after challenge of the monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from oral microorganisms. LPS of two putative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) was prepared. Whole blood samples in EDTA were collected from 30 HIV+ patients presenting for dental care at the University of Maryland. Control samples were prepared from appropriate uninfected individuals. Viral load was determined using quantitative RT-PCR (Amplicor, Roche Diagnostics). Phagocytic function was determined using FITC labeled Saccharomyces species in resting isolated monocytes and in cells after 24 h stimulation with 1 microgram/ml of LPS of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for complement receptor CR-1 (CD-35) on phagocyte cells. In HIV+ patients with high viral load (> 10,000 copies/ml), 13.5% of isolated resting monocytes demonstrated phagocytic activity, while 23% of the resting control monocytes from non-infected individuals showed phagocytic function. When the monocytes were stimulated with 1 microgram/ml of LPS of F. nucleatum, phagocytic activity was observed in 18.5% of monocytes in patients with high viral load, 33.5% with moderate viral load (400-10,00 copies/ml) and 51% with low viral load (<400 copies/ml), while 62% of the control monocytes demonstrated phagocytic activity. Stimulation of monocytes with LPS of P. gingivalis showed similar results. Complement receptor CD-35 showed a 50% decrease in expression in HIV+ patients with high viral load. A progressive decrease in monocyte/macrophage phagocytic function and CD-35 expression with and without oral LPS activation occurs after HIV infection and this trend appears to be accentuated in patients with high viral load. This relationship may contribute to increased susceptibility to oral opportunistic infections in advanced HIV+ patients.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum septicemia and portal vein thrombosis.
AB  
TI  - Infection-stimulated infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction is increased in P-/E-selectin knockout mice.
AB  - Infections of the dental pulp commonly result in infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction. However, the role of phagocytic leucocytes in the pathogenesis of pulpal infections has been uncertain. In this work we used P/E-/- selectin-deficient mice, which lack rolling adhesion of leucocytes to endothelium and mimic the human syndrome, leucocyte adhesion deficiency II (LAD-II), to test the hypothesis that phagocytic leucocytes protect against pulpal infection and subsequent periapical infraosseus bone resorption. P/E-/- mice and P/E+/+ wild-type controls were subjected to surgical pulp exposure, and both groups were infected with a mixture of pulpal pathogens including Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius. Animals were killed after 20 days, and the extent of infraosseus bone destruction was quantified by histomorphometry. In two separate experiments, P/E-/- mice had significantly greater bone resorption than P/E+/+ controls. The increased bone destruction correlated with a twofold decrease in polymorphonuclear (PMN) infiltration into periapical inflammatory tissues of P/E-/- mice. P/E-/- mice had higher tissue levels of the bone resorptive cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1alpha. Tissue levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were all higher in P/E-/- mice, but the increases were not statistically significant. Only IL-12 was higher in P/E+/+ mice, possibly reflecting a greater number of infiltrating monocytes in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that phagocytic leucocytes are protective in this model, and suggest that elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the observed bone destruction.
TI  - Antigen activation of THP-1 human monocytic cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
AB  - A human THP-1 monocyte cell line culture system has been utilized to evaluate the morphological changes in THP-1 cells and to measure expression of activation antigens (CD-11b, CD-11c, CD-14, CD-35, CD-68, CD-71 and HLA-DR) as evidence of maturation of THP-1 cells in response to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the oral microorganisms, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS (1 microgram/ml) of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum for different time periods (1, 2, 4 and 7 d). Detection of different activation antigens on THP-1 cells was performed by indirect immunohistochemical staining followed by light microscopy. Confirmational studies were performed in parallel using indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy for detection of the corresponding activation antigens. Expression of different activation antigens by resting THP-1 cells revealed HLA-DR to be on 3% of the cells; CD-11b, 9%; CD-11c, 8%; CD-14, 22%; CD-35, 9% and CD-68, 7%. The CD-71 activation antigen was not expressed in untreated THP-1 cells. LPS stimulation increased expression of all activation antigens. A significant (p < 0.05) increase in expression of CD-11b, CD-11c, CD-14, CD-35, CD-68 and CD-71 was observed when GM-CSF (50 IU/ml) was supplemented during the treatment of THP-1 cells with LPS of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis. Activation and differentiation of THP-1 cells by LPS from oral microorganisms in the presence of GM-CSF supports a role for human macrophages in acute and chronic periodontal diseases and may explain the clinically observable periodontal exacerbations in some patients after GM-CSF therapy.
TI  - Oral microflora in subjects with reduced salivary secretion.
AB  - It is generally assumed that a decreased salivary secretion rate will promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk for caries, gingival inflammation, and mucosal infections. In this study, the effect of hyposalivation on the oral microflora was examined. The following micro-organisms were analyzed in rinsing samples from 14 subjects with hyposalivation: the total number of anaerobically growing micro-organisms, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and enterics. The study group, age 53 +/- 7 years, had no history of radiation therapy and showed no signs of inflammation in their salivary glands on biopsy. All were dentate with a mean of 24 +/- 3 teeth. Their salivary secretion rates were 0.03 +/- 0.02 mL/min (unstimulated) and 0.84 +/- 0.65 mL/min (stimulated). The control group was matched to the hyposalivation group according to age, sex, and number of teeth. There was a significantly increased number of lactobacilli, and a tendency, not statistically significant and with large variations within the groups, toward a higher proportion of mutans streptococci and a lower proportion of alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the hyposalivation group. The presence of micro-organisms associated with gingival inflammation and mucosal infections was comparable with that in the healthy controls. The results indicated that a low salivary secretion rate mainly promotes a flora associated with the development of caries.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. The subgingival plaque samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. The results showed Porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with Bacteroides forsythus. Peptostreptococcus sp., Actinomyces sp. and Prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus and Eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in the healthy subjects.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of an essential oil and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse in vitro.
AB  - Although laboratory studies are not necessarily predictive of clinical activity;  they can help to elucidate mechanisms underlying clinical activity when the latter has been established. In a recent clinical study, an essential oil mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic) was shown to be significantly more effective than an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse (Meridol) in inhibiting supragingival plaque formation. This paper reports the results of laboratory studies comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of these 2 mouthrinses using a kill kinetics assay and a plaque biofilm kill assay. In both assays, the essential oil mouthrinse was considerably more effective than the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse. These findings are consistent with the results of the clinical trial and may help to explain the observed differences in clinical activity.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in patients with adult periodontitis. A randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological  effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in adult periodontitis patients using a double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled protocol. 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of generalised adult periodontitis were recruited. Clinical measurements and microbiological assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. Approximately 6 weeks after initial periodontal treatment (3-6 h), patients were randomly assigned to receive coded study medication of 500 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid (Augmentin) or placebo, every 8 h for 10 days. Patients returned for follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of the medication. The mean plaque index (PI) at baseline was 1.1 for placebo group and 0.9 for the test group. At 3 months, the PI had dropped to 0.3 in both groups, and was maintained during the rest of the study. The changes in bleeding on probing (BOP) and gingival index (GI) in the course of the study were similar in both groups. The mean whole mouth probing pocket depth (PPD) in the placebo group was 3.8 mm at baseline and 3.9 mm in the test group. A mean reduction of 1.0 mm in the placebo group and 0.9 mm in the test group was observed during the first 3 months. No further reduction in PPD was noticed during the study period in either group. There was no statistically significant difference in the PPD reduction between the 2 groups. The change in clinical attachment level (CAL) from baseline to 3 months amounted to 0.5 mm in both groups. Between 3 and 12 months, the CAL changed in neither group. In both groups, treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of spirochetes and motile rods in positive patients, but no significant differences between either group were noted in any of the dark field microscopy observations. At baseline, 1 patient in the placebo group and 2 patients in the test group were culture positive for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa). After therapy, Aa was not detectable in the placebo group and 1 patient remained positive in the test group. In the placebo group, the number of patients positive for Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) decreased from 7 to 2 after therapy. In the test group, the 4 patients positive for Pg at baseline remained positive after therapy. In both groups, all subjects were positive for Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) at baseline. At 12 months, all subjects had detectable subgingival Fn. 9 out of the 11 placebo and 8 of the 10 test patients remained positive for Pi. There were no differences in detection frequency of Peptostreptococcus micros (Pm) and Bacteroides forsythus (Bf) in both groups between baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. The findings demonstrated that, in comparison to placebo, systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid provided no additional clinical and microbiological effects in the treatment of adult periodontitis patients.
TI  - A 15-month evaluation of the effects of repeated subgingival minocycline in chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A double-blind, randomized, parallel, comparative study was designed  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subgingivally administered minocycline ointment versus a vehicle control. METHODS: One hundred four patients (104) with moderate to severe adult periodontitis (34 to 64 years of age; mean 46 years) were enrolled in the study. Following scaling and root planing, patients were randomized to receive either 2% minocycline ointment or a matched vehicle control. Study medication was administered directly into the periodontal pocket with a specially designed, graduated, disposable applicator at baseline; week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Scaling and root planing was repeated at months 6 and 12. Standard clinical variables (including probing depth and attachment level) were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Microbiological sampling using DNA probes was done at baseline; at week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. RESULTS: Both treatment groups showed significant and clinically relevant reductions in the numbers of each of the 7 microorganisms measured during the entire 15-month study period. When differences were detected, sites treated with minocycline ointment always produced statistically significantly greater reductions than sites which received the vehicle control. For initial pockets > or =5 mm, a mean reduction in probing depth of 1.9 mm was seen in the test sites, versus 1.2 mm in the control sites. Sites with a baseline probing depth > or =7 mm and bleeding index >2 showed an average of 2.5 mm reduction with minocycline versus 1.5 mm with the vehicle. Gains in attachment (0.9 mm and 1.1 mm) were observed in minocycline-treated sites, with baseline probing depth > or =5 mm and > or =7 mm, respectively, compared with 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm gain at control sites. Subgingival administration of minocycline ointment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results demonstrate that repeated subgingival administration of minocycline ointment in the treatment of adult periodontitis is safe and leads to significant adjunctive improvement after subgingival instrumentation in both clinical and microbiologic variables over a 15-month period.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production by oral anaerobic gram-negative species in infants in relation to previous antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - The frequency of beta-lactamase production in gram-negative bacteria has increased considerably during recent years. In this study, beta-lactamase production by oral anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from saliva was longitudinally examined for 44 Caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, and 12 months in relation to their documented exposure to antibiotics. Isolates showing decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (1 microg/ml) were examined for beta-lactamase production by using a chromogenic cephalosporin disk test. beta-Lactamase-positive, gram-negative anaerobic species were found in 11, 55, and 89% of each age group, respectively. beta-Lactamase production was most frequent among organisms of the Prevotella melaninogenica group. At 12 months, 73% of the infants harbored beta-lactamase-producing members of the P. melaninogenica group, 55% had nonpigmented Prevotella species, 25% had Porphyromonas catoniae, 23% had Fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5% had Capnocytophaga species. Several beta-lactamase-producing species could be simultaneously found in the infants' mouths. The presence of beta-lactamase-producing species was significantly associated with the infants' exposure to antibiotics through antimicrobial treatments given to the infants and/or their mothers.
TI  - Flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - The reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. We applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, P. nigrescens, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. Bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. Ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in the PMNL population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. Furthermore, the oxidative burst of PMNLs was detected in parallel assays using the dye DHR123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. We found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing PMNLs, ranging from 10.6% (strain W83) to > 99.4% (e.g. ATCC 33277T) in P. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain MH5) to > 95% (ATCC 33563T) in P. nigrescens. In contrast, almost all P. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. Comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding P. gingivalis strains suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.
TI  - Intra-familial distribution of Fusobacterium nucleatum strains in healthy families with optimal plaque control.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobic rod associated with periodontal disease, is also found in healthy individuals and is considered part of the indigenous oral microflora. Although intra-familial transmission of periodontal pathogens has been documented, there are no data relating transmission of F. nucleatum. This study investigated the distribution of F. nucleatum strains in 4 strictly healthy families. 32 F. nucleatum strains were isolated from 19 individuals (8 parents and 11 children aged 1-13 years). DNA was extracted and digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, TaqI and HindIII. The digests were separated by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels at 40 V overnight, in TBE buffer containing 1 microg/ml ethidium bromide, and photographed. The DNA was transferred to nylon filters by Southern blotting and hybridized with a digoxigenin labelled E. coli rRNA probe (Kit Dig DNA Labelling mixture - Boehringer). Probed DNA was visualized colorimetrically (CSPD Luminescent Detection Kit Boehringer) and photographed (Amersham). We found that 10/11 children shared identical ribotypes with at least one of their respective parents. Some of the children also harbored a unique additional ribotype. On the basis of indistinguishable restriction endonuclease and ribotype patterns these results support the hypothesis that intra-familial transmission of F. nucleatum is possible.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of putative periodontal pathogens in advanced periodontitis patients.
AB  - In the present study, the antibiotic susceptibility of most prevalent micro-organisms in advanced periodontitis patients was evaluated. In 56 patients, pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest site of each quadrant and were cultivated anaerobically. From each patient, the 4 most frequently encountered types of bacterial colonies were subcultured and identified (Rapid ID 32 A). From all bacterial species identified in the 224 subcultures, the 4 most prevalent were used for susceptibility testing to tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate using the E Test. The most prevalent microorganisms were Fusobacterium nucleatum (38/214), Peptostreptococcus micros (33/214), Prevotella oralis (33/214) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (32/214). Regarding antibiotic susceptibility it could be shown that minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all cases was below antibiotic concentrations achievable in gingival crevicular fluid. However, antibiotic resistance was seen in 3 to 29% of the investigated microorganisms.
TI  - The effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  - Susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. We investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. In a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a continuous culture system comprised of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/mL of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic Gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. For ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. In both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). Although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.
TI  - Linezolid activity compared to those of selected macrolides and other agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from soft tissue bite infections in humans.
AB  - Linezolid was tested against 420 aerobes and anaerobes, including 148 Pasteurella isolates, by an agar dilution method. Linezolid was active against all Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida and P. multocida subsp. septica isolates and most Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, and Pasteurella stomatis isolates. The MIC was </=2 microg/ml for staphylococci, streptococci, EF-4b, Weeksella zoohelcum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, other fusobacteria, Porphyromonas spp., Prevotella spp., peptostreptococci, and almost all Bacteroides tectum isolates.
TI  - Effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - In this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). The growth of P. gingivalis was only moderately affected when H2O2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mM in a complex culture medium. However, when a defined basal medium was used, H2O2 at a concentration of 3 mM completely inhibited growth of P. gingivalis. Incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mM in both media had no effect on growth. The effects of H2O2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and Arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. Both activities were strongly decreased when H2O2 was added in the assay mixtures. This inhibitory effect of H2O2 was reversible. On the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. H2O2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-68 and HSP-75 by P. gingivalis, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting analysis. In the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of the environment. It was found that certain species were able to either decrease (P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus mutans) or increase (Streptococcus sanguis) the Eh of the medium. Our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as H2O2 may affect the biology of P. gingivalis. Moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as P. gingivalis.
TI  - Abscess forming ability of streptococcus milleri group: synergistic effect with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The abscess forming abilities of "Streptococcus milleri" strains (Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginiosus, and Streptococcus intermedius) isolated from dentoalveolar abscesses and the synergistic effect of Fusobacterium nucleatum co-inoculated with the isolates were examined on a mouse subcutaneous abscess model. Five days after inoculation, all S. milleri strains formed abscesses, which showed less pathological spread to surrounding connective tissues than those formed by Staphylococcus aureus 209P strain and were similar to those by F. nucleatum ATCC25586. When each S. milleri strain and F. nucleatum were co-inoculated, abscess sizes and each bacterial number recovered from abscesses increased in comparison to those treated by bacterial mono-inoculation of each S. milleri strain or F. nucleatum alone. The strongest synergistic effect was observed in the combination of S. constellatus and F. nucleatum. In a time course experiment with this combination, the recovery of S. constellatus subsequently decreased after the decrement of F. nucleatum, and it appeared that the association with F. nucleatum maintained the bacterial number of S. constellatus in the abscess. The cell-free supernatant of F. nucleatum had a tendency to increase the abscess size caused by S. constellatus in this model. When S. constellatus was cultured with F. nucleatum culture supernatant in vitro, growth enhancement in the early phase was observed. Furthermore, the phagocytic killing of S. constellatus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was significantly suppressed and the PMN membranes appeared to be injured by addition of the F. nucleatum culture supernatant. These results suggest that the pathogenicity of S. milleri strains in odontogenic infections may be enhanced by the co-existence of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Microbiological and clinical effects of a 1% chlorhexidine-gel in untreated periodontal pockets from adult periodontitis patients.
AB  - The aim of this study was to report the microbiological and clinical effects of repeated subgingival administration of a 1% Chlorhexidine-gel in periodontal pockets from 10 patients with adult periodontitis. Results showed that the experimental treatment significantly improved clinical parameters (Plaque Index, Gingival Bleeding Index, and Pocket Probing Depth). Direct subgingival administration of Chlorhexidine-gel also produced a remarkable modification in the proportions of putative periodontopathic microorganisms, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros, in subgingival bacterial plaque from periodontitis patients.
TI  - Periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. METHODS: Reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (MZ) and dizygous (DZ) adult twins were examined clinically. Demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth, and the presence of P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens, and F. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. RESULTS: Microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. The subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for Porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for F. nucleatum. For all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between MZ and DZ twin groups. These findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. Furthermore, MZ twins reared together were not more similar than MZ reared-apart twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. Most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. Results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.
TI  - beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of oral heterogeneous  Fusobacterium nucleatum populations in young children.
AB  - Oral Fusobacterium nucleatum populations from 20 young, healthy children were examined for beta-lactamase production. Ten children (50%) harbored, altogether, 25 beta-lactamase-positive F. nucleatum isolates that were identified as F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii (J. L. Dzink, M. T. Sheenan, and S. S. Socransky, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 40:74-78, 1990). In vitro susceptibility of these beta-lactamase-producing and 26 non-beta-lactamase-producing F. nucleatum isolates was tested with penicillin G, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, tetracycline hydrochloride, metronidazole, trovafloxacin, and azithromycin. Except for penicillin G, the antimicrobials exhibited good activity against all F. nucleatum isolates.
TI  - Induction of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - We examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte autoantibody (ATA) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from periodontopathic bacteria; Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral Escherichia coli. All of the LPS induced IgM-ATA. Among these, LPS from C. ochracea induced the highest level of IgM-ATA, whereas that of P. gingivalis induced the lowest. The peritoneal T lymphocytes of mice injected with LPS were bound by IgM-ATA. Peritoneal B-1 (CD5+B) cells stimulated by each LPS produced much more IgM-ATA than splenic B-2 (CD5-B) cells, suggesting that B-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. Serum of mice injected with C. ochracea and F. nucleatum LPS showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. Binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by IgM purified from serum of the mice injected with C. ochracea LPS. Furthermore, serum of mice treated with C. ochracea, F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. However, purified IgM from the serum of mice treated with C. ochracea LPS failed to produce the same inhibition. Our results suggest that LPS from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce IgM-ATA in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
TI  - Coaggregation of Candida dubliniensis with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The binding of microorganisms to each other and oral surfaces contributes to the  progression of microbial infections in the oral cavity. Candida dubliniensis, a newly characterized species, has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. C. dubliniensis phenotypically resembles Candida albicans in many respects yet can be identified and differentiated as a unique Candida species by phenotypic and genetic profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine oral coaggregation (CoAg) partners of C. dubliniensis and to compare these findings with CoAg of C. albicans under the same environmental conditions. Fifteen isolates of C. dubliniensis and 40 isolates of C. albicans were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. When C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees C on Sabouraud dextrose agar, only C. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with F. nucleatum ATCC 49256 and no C. albicans strains showed CoAg. However, when the C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees C, both C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains demonstrated CoAg with F. nucleatum. Heating the C. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees C) at 85 degrees C for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the C. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees C to coaggregate with F. nucleatum. CoAg at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by EDTA or arginine. The CoAg reaction between F. nucleatum and the Candida species involved a heat-labile component on F. nucleatum and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the Candida species. The CoAg reactions between F. nucleatum and the Candida species may be important in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the CoAg of C. dubliniensis by F. nucleatum when grown at 37 degrees C provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate C. dubliniensis from C. albicans isolates in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Haemagglutination and haemolysis by oral Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Haemagglutination and haemolytic activity of 80 Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates  from human and animal origin, on different human blood types was evaluated. All the isolates were able to agglutinate erythrocytes and the most were either alpha-haemolytic or beta-haemolytic. No specificity between haemolysin or haemagglutinin and blood type was observed. Haemagglutination activity was inhibited when D-galactose, D-lactose or D-raffinose were used. Haemagglutination and haemolysis may be important factors in the pathogenesis of human and animal periodontal diseases.
TI  - Identification of positively charged residues of FomA porin of Fusobacterium nucleatum which are important for pore function.
AB  - FomA porin is the major outer-membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum. It exhibits the functional properties of a general diffusion porin, but has no sequence similarity to other porins. According to the proposed topology model, each monomer of this trimeric protein is a beta-barrel consisting of 16 transmembrane segments with eight surface-exposed loops. Several conserved charged residues are proposed to extend from the beta-barrel wall into the aqueous channel lumen, and may contribute to a transverse electric field similar to that at the pore constriction of porins with known structure. The goal of our study was to identify particular basic residues contributing to such an electric field in FomA. Several arginines and lysines were replaced by negatively charged glutamates or uncharged alanines. The mutated FomA porins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the effects on pore function were studied in vivo, by assaying the uptake rate of beta-lactam antibiotics, and in vitro after reconstitution of the purified proteins in lipid bilayer membranes. Some of the point mutations had a significant impact on the channel properties. The substitution R92A produced a 130% increased permeability of the zwitterionic beta-lactam cephaloridine, and the cation selectivity of R92E increased by 70%. The effects of the R90E substitution on channel properties were similar. Most of the point mutations had a minor effect on the voltage gating of the FomA channel, resulting in an increased sensitivity, except for K78E, which showed a decreased sensitivity. The latter mutation had no effect on cation selectivity, but the K78A substitution improved the uptake rate of cephaloridine. The results presented here indicate that arginines 90 and 92 are probably part of the constriction zone of the FomA porin, and lysine 78 and arginines 115 and 117 are probably in close proximity to this region as well.
TI  - Microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. Periodontal pathogens colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. This study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. It was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. METHODS: This study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. Eighty-one (81) non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. The microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic DNA probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. RESULTS: Implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, Veillonella parvula, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The periodontal species, P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. The microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. Streptococcus oralis, P. intermedia, and Selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. Microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. No differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. CONCLUSIONS: While presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. A history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. The major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.
TI  - Interleukin-6 production by human monocytes treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the presence of lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms.
AB  - This study focused on the effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lipopolysaccharide of the putative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum on IL-6 production by THP-1 cells (a human monocytic cell line). Resting THP-1 cells were alternatively treated with GM-CSF (50 IU/ml) and lipopolysaccharide of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum, in varying concentrations for varying time periods. IL-6 production in supernatant fluids of treated cells was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate gene expression. Untreated THP-1 cells did not produce IL-6 as determined by ELISA. RT-PCR also failed to detect IL-6 mRNA in untreated THP-1 cells, indicating that IL-6 was not constitutively produced. After stimulation of THP-1 cells with lipopolysaccharide of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis, IL-6 was produced, peaking at 4 h (200-300 pg/ml) and thereafter sharply declining by 8 h. When GM-CSF was added together with lipopolysaccharide of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum, there was a synergistic quantitative increase in production of IL-6 as measured by ELISA as compared with lipopolysaccharide alone. IL-6 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, 15 min after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide of either P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. GM-CSF supplementation with lipopolysaccharide of P. gingivalis shortened the transcription of IL-6 mRNA to 5 min, a shift which was not observed with lipopolysaccharide of F. nucleatum, possibly indicating a different mechanism of initiation of transcription. Production of IL-6 by GM-CSF-treated THP-1 cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms may provide a model for studying the role of macrophages in acute and chronic periodontal diseases, including the clinical periodontal exacerbation as observed in chemotherapy patients receiving GM-CSF for bone marrow recovery.
TI  - Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in patients  with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Our objective was to study the immune response to 2 anaerobic bacteria in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis. Immunoglobulin G class antibody titers to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels in the patients were determined on the day sinus aspiration for culture was done, and 75 to 90 days later, after completion of antimicrobial therapy, Prevotella intermedia was isolated from 16 aspirates, and F. nucleatum from 12. Median antibody levels at day 1 for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were significantly higher in patients whose serum aspirates harbored these organisms than at days 75 to 90 in those who were cured (p < .05). However, the levels stayed elevated in the 5 patients who did not improve. The elevated antibody levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in chronic maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - Dominant cross-reactive antibodies generated during the response to a variety of  oral bacterial species detect phosphorylcholine.
AB  - The intraperitoneal immunization of Balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus mitis, or Streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable IgM monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. This study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. Using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. The concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. Labeled bacteria belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. Of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. Haemophilus aphrophilus, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, Actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. These data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - Relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). METHODS: Thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. Within each subject, the AST contents of GCF from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. AST-positive site refers to one that had an AST level > or = 800 microIU. Subgingival plaque samples from one AST-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. One site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. Clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. Culture and immunofluorescence (IF) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the AST test and certain specific pathogens. RESULTS: The GCF scores and total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in AST-positive sites than either AST-negative or healthy sites. The prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as C rectus, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. In analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the AST test by logistic regression, only P. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. The odds ratio of having a high proportion of P. gingivalis in the presence of a positive AST test was 1.21. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that at AST-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. Although only the correlation of P. gingivalis and AST values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of AST levels in GCF.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses against possible causative bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  - We examined the induction of inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) by several species of possible causative bacteria in periapical periodontitis. Assays were done on human whole blood cultures from patients with differing numbers of periapical lesions; those having radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high lesion group), in one or two teeth (low lesion group), and healthy volunteers having no periapical lesions (no lesion group). Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845 induced interleukin-6 more strongly in subjects from the high lesion group than in the other groups. To ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the six subjects to different bacterial species. Porphylomonas gingivalis cells reacted strongly with sera from the high lesion group. Thus, Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphylomonas gingivalis may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing specific cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.
TI  - Elastase activity of anaerobes isolated from amniotic fluid with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A total of 131 anaerobes isolated from amniotic fluid with preterm premature rupture of membranes and stored were examined for elastolytic activity by the method described by Williams et al (Lett Appl Microbiol 1988;7:173-6). STUDY DESIGN: Each strain was spot inoculated on a Columbia blood agar plate containing 1% solubilized elastin and incubated for 5 days under anaerobic conditions. Undigested elastin was precipitated by flooding trichloroacetic acid solution onto the plate, and a clear zone was visible as the elastolytic reaction around the spot of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Ninety-three (71.0%) of 131 organisms showed a positive elastolytic reaction. Eleven of 20 strains (55.0%) of Peptostreptococcus magnus, 9 of 18 strains (50.0%) of Peptostreptococcus micros, 12 of 12 strains (100.0%) of Fusobacterium nucleatum, 15 of 28 strains (53.6%) of Bacteroides fragilis, 8 of 15 strains (53.3%) of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and 38 of 38 strains (100.0%) of Prevotella bivia were elastolytic. CONCLUSION: Anaerobic bacterial species prevalent in the normal vaginal flora that were isolated from amniotic fluid of women with preterm rupture of membranes produced elastolytic activity, plausibly inducing the destruction of host constitutive components.
TI  - Unexpected cross-reaction with Fusobacterium necrophorum in a PCR for detection of mycoplasmas.
AB  - Cross-reactions with Fusobacterium necrophorum were found in a PCR designed for detection of a wide range of mycoplasma species. Twenty-five strains of Fusobacterium were examined; all 14 F. necrophorum strains reacted positively, whereas all 7 Fusobacterium nucleatum strains reacted negatively. Two strains that were not F. necrophorum yielded variable results.
TI  - Coronal leakage: endotoxin penetration from mixed bacterial communities through obturated, post-prepared root canals.
AB  - Coronal leakage has been considered as one of the major causes of failure in root canal treatment. Bacteria have been shown to penetrate the root canal obturating materials and influence the periapical tissues. Endotoxin, a component of Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inflammatory agent and may be able to penetrate obturating materials faster than bacteria. This in vitro study examined the possible penetration of post-prepared canals by endotoxin and bacterial cells derived from mixed bacterial communities. Results showed that both bacteria and endotoxin were able to penetrate the obturating materials in post-prepared canals; however, endotoxin penetration was faster than bacterial. If one speculates that a similar sequence of events occurs clinically, then such a rapid penetration of endotoxin could lead to an early periapical reaction, with subsequent treatment failure and need for retreatment or periapical surgery. The need for an immediate and proper coronal restoration after root canal treatment is therefore reinforced.
TI  - Oral microbial flora in Sjogren's syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study presence of microorganisms associated with caries, gingivitis, oral opportunistic infections, and extent of hyposalivation in dentate patients with primary and secondary Sjogren's syndrome (SS). METHODS: An oral clinical examination was performed. The salivary flow was measured and a rinsing sample analyzed for presence of specific microorganisms. The results were compared to those of healthy controls matched for sex, age, and number of teeth. RESULTS: In patients with undetectable salivary flow at rest, mean number and proportion of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli showed a tendency to be increased, as well as the frequency of Candida. They also displayed an increased proportion of filled surfaces. In contrast, gingivitis and the numbers of microorganisms associated with gingivitis were comparable to those found in the healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Patients with SS and severe hyposalivation harbor oral flora associated with the development of caries and frequent presence of retention sites, indicating a need for efficient preventive dental care.
TI  - Preparation and characterization of an Actinomyces naeslundii aggregation factor  that mediates coaggregation with Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Intergeneric coaggregation is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to be important in the initial bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. Actinomyces naeslundii, an early colonizer of the tooth surface, may enhance subsequent colonization by Porphyromonas gingivalis which is associated with adult periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the A. naeslundii aggregation factor (AnAF) that mediates coaggregation with P. gingivalis. AnAF was isolated from A. naeslundii sonic extract (SE) by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-400HR, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a HiTrap Octyl Sepharose 4FF, and by ion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q. The specific activity increased 12-fold with a yield of 2.5%. SDS-PAGE analysis of AnAF revealed a protein band of high molecular weight in excess of 200 kDa. Carbohydrate was detected as the only material coinciding with the protein band, indicating that the AnAF was a glycoprotein. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that AnAF directly bound to P. gingivalis cells. AnAF was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment but not to heat or protease treatments. These results suggest that the AnAF carbohydrate component mediated coaggregation with P. gingivalis cells. AnAF also inhibited coaggregation with other periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, but not streptococci.
TI  - Identification of highly fucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides from the human parotid gland.
AB  - The glycosylation of a number of constituents of human saliva is known to modify  its biological roles, such as its lubricating properties and binding of microbial flora. Gillece-Castro et al. [Gillece-Castro, B. L., Prakobphol, A., Burlingame, A. L., Leffler, H. & Fisher, S. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17358-17368] have proposed that the major glycan on the salivary proline-rich glycoproteins is a trifucosylated biantennary sugar with one difucosylated and one unfucosylated antenna. Furthermore, they proposed that the non-fucosylated antenna mediated adherence to a peridontal pathogen, Fusobacterium nucleatum. The detailed structures and roles of other highly fucosylated glycans that co-exist in the parotid gland are not fully known. In view of the influence of outer-arm fucosylation on carbohydrate recognition processes in general, this paper reports the use of a combination of HPLC (normal and reversed phase), matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometry and exoglycosidase digestions to dissect the detailed structures of the most abundant of these polyfucosylated glycans. For measurement of reversed-phase HPLC retention times, new calibration units were used which paralleled the glucose units used for normal-phase HPLC. These differed in that the difference in retention times were compared with those derived from a ladder of 2-aminobenzamide-labelled arabinose oligomers instead of the corresponding oligomers from partially hydrolysed dextran. Over sixty neutral sugars were identified from the parotid gland and many of these were additionally found substituted with sialic acid (both alpha2-3-linked and alpha2-6-linked) and sulphate. These glycans were mainly bi- and tri-antennary sugars with up to five and seven fucose residues respectively, containing fucose alpha1-3-linked to the outer-arm GlcNAc residues and alpha1-2-linked to the galactose. All fucosylated structures contained a core (alpha1-6-linked) fucose. The detailed structure of the trifucosylated biantennary glycan was confirmed, together with the structures of another 12 fucosylated biantennary glycans. Smaller amounts of hybrid and tetraantennary structures were also found and bisected glycans were shown to be constituents of parotid glycoproteins for the first time. Acidic glycans were mainly substituted with sialic acid. Most were monosialylated as the presence of fucose on the antennae was found to suppress the addition of extra sialic acid moieties. The possible functional significance of highly fucosylated N-glycans is discussed in relation to their modification of the availability of other non-reducing terminal monosaccharides for recognition processes.
TI  - Analysis of serum antibody responses to periodontopathogens in early-onset periodontitis patients from different geographical locations.
AB  - Serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a Turkish population. Additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar US patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. Serum from 89 (LJP), 86 (RPP) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (ELISA) to determine IgG antibody to 14 oral micro-organisms. All LJP patients from Turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and JP2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in US LJP patients. 50% of the Turkish RPP patients also showed elevated anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the US RPP patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. Healthy subjects and LJP and RPP patients from the US exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 P. gingivalis serogroups compared to those from Turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the P. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in LJP and RPP patients from Turkey than from the US. Interestingly, 87% and 77% of the LJP patients in the Turkish population had elevated antibody responses to P. gingivalis and E. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the US LJP patients. These data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. This supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.
TI  - Preterm labor and bacterial intraamniotic infection: arachidonic acid liberation  by phospholipase A2 of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The studies presented in this report were undertaken to evaluate whether Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common anaerobic isolate in intrauterine infection, stimulates arachidonic acid metabolism, a rate-limiting step for prostaglandin synthesis, in the human uterine endometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Effects of F nucleatum on arachidonic acid liberation from human uterine endometrial cells and of F nucleatum extract on lysophosphatidylcholine production in human uterine endometrial cells were investigated. RESULTS: When human uterine endometrial cells labeled with tritiated arachidonic acid to an isotopically steady state were exposed to an extract of F nucleatum, arachidonic acid liberation was stimulated, accompanied by lysophospholipid formation. Similar stimulatory effects on phospholipid degradation were also observed in the experiment with bacterially conditioned media. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that F nucleatum stimulates endometrial phospholipid metabolism, related to activity of phospholipase A2, which might induce the onset of labor associated with intraamniotic infection.
TI  - Septic arthritis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  
TI  - Additional clinical and microbiological effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole  after initial periodontal therapy.
AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects  of initial periodontal therapy (IT) and to determine the additional effects of systemic amoxicillin (Flemoxin Solutab) 375 mg TID plus metronidazole 250 mg TID therapy, in patients with adult Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa)-associated periodontitis in conjunction with either Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Bacteroides forsythus (Bf) and/or Prevotella intermedia (Pi). In addition the adverse effects of the antimicrobial therapy were also documented. A total of 22 patients were enrolled. The deepest, bleeding pocket in each quadrant was selected and at these 4 experimental sites clinical measurements and microbiological testing was carried out at baseline, after (IT), i.e., 21 weeks after baseline, and after antimicrobial therapy (AM), i.e., 35 weeks after baseline. At baseline, the mean plaque index (PI) amounted 0.5, 0.1 after IT and 0.3 after systemic AM. The mean bleeding index decreased from 1.6 to 1.2 after IT and a further decrease to 0.7 after AM was noted. Suppuration was completely eliminated after AM. The mean change of probing pocket depth (PPD) after IT amounted 1.4 mm and was further reduced with an additional mean change of 1.1 mm after medication. Clinical attachment gain was 1.1 mm after IT and an additional 0.9 mm was observed after AM. One of the 22 Aa positive patients and 4 of 17 Pg positive patients became negative for these species after IT. The number of patients with detectable Pi decreased from 16 to 10 after IT. After AM, in comparison to baseline, suppression below detection level for Aa was achieved in 19 out of 22, for Pg in 9 out of 17, for Bf in 13 out of 14, and for Pi in 11 out of 16 patients. By contrast, higher frequencies of Peptostreptococcus micros and Fusobacterium nucleatum were found after AM. On the basis of the microbiological results the study group was separated into 2 subgroups: group A consisted of subjects who had no detectable levels of Aa, Pg, Bf and <5% of Pi after AM. Group B consisted of those who still showed presence of one of these 3 species and/or > or =5% levels of Pi. After AM, group B had significantly higher PI, BI, PPD and CAL scores then group A. It is concluded that group A showed low plaque scores and no detectable periodontal pathogens. This microbiological condition has been associated with a long-term stable periodontium.
TI  - [A comparative in-vitro study of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide on root canal anaerobic bacterial flora].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The permanence of necrotic tissues and/or bacteria may be responsible for persistent root canal infection. Root canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the progressive elimination of the smear layer and, on the other, it neutralises microbic flora within the canal. The aim of this study was to test root canal irrigants from a microbiological point of view: sodium hypochlorite 5% (Niclor Ogna, Milan) and a new generation irrigant based on chlorhexidine gluconate and cetrimide (Cetrexidine VEBAS S. Giuliano Milanese-MI). METHODS: The experiments were performed on a series of obligatory anaerobic bacteria which are most frequently found in the endodontium, all belonging to the international collection "American Type Culture Collection" (ATCC) and supplied by Dasit SpA, Cornaredo (MI). The following bacterial strains were used in the experiment: Actinimyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Prevotella melanginogenica ATCC 25845, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277. The working concentration (CFU/ml) was defined as 0.5 McFarland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms equivalent to approx. 1.5 x 10(3) bacteria. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for this experiment for 10', 20', 30'. RESULTS: The results obtained confirm the bactericidal efficacy of both irrigants used, even after a short contact time. CONCLUSIONS: This does not mean that all irrigants are the same and/or promise the same results. This was a microbiological study, but in practice it is important to bear in mind other variables, such as contact time. Moreover, in order to increase the probability of endodontic treatment, root canal irrigants are also required to satisfy other criteria: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.
TI  - Evaluation of the Bactericidal Activity on Oral Organisms of the Nd-YAP Laser In  Vitro.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of a pulsed fibre-optic Nd-YAP laser on various strains of oral bacteria: Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus (i), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Peptostreptococcus micros (i) was evaluated. A 200-mum optical fibre was placed in Eppendorf tubes containing the different bacterial suspensions. At an energy of 170 mJ/30 Hz, 351 pulses of 150 mus were sufficient to kill the most resistant bacteria (i). The exposure time was 28 s. The temperature rise caused by the shots were measured in vitro at the surface of the roots of two groups of 10 single-rooted teeth. One group received 350 pulses; for the other the preparation time was fixed at 28 s. The temperature rose by 25.66 degrees C for the first group and 25.25 degrees C for the second.
TI  - Polymicrobial coronal leakage of super EBA root-end fillings following two methods of root-end preparation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compose in vitro coronal leakage of a super EBA root-end filling material after two root-end cavity preparation techniques. A mixed anaerobic microbial marker was used. Forty-five extracted human teeth with straight, single root canals were prepared chemo-mechanically to a size 40 master apical file. The teeth were divided into experimental groups (35 teeth) and control groups (10 teeth). Forty teeth (35 experimental teeth and five negative control teeth) were obturated by lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha with Tubliseal EWT sealer. The remaining five teeth were not obturated and served as positive controls. These teeth were stored for 6 months in artificial saliva. The apical 3-4 mm of each root was resected perpendicular to the long axis of the root and a root-end cavity prepared to a depth of 3 mm using either a size 008 rosehead burr or an ultrasonic retroprep tip. Freshly mixed EBA cement was placed into the root-end cavity. The entire root surface of each tooth, except the cutting surface of the apical end, was sealed with nail varnish. The coronal part of each root canal was sealed with the cut end of a tube and placed in a bottle containing sterile Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHIB). A marker consisting of Anaerobic streptococci and Fusobacterium nucleatum in BHIB was placed in each coronal chamber at 7-day intervals and daily observations were made for bacterial growth in the apical chamber for 60 days. All positive control teeth exhibited bacterial leakage within 48 h, whilst the apical chamber of negative control teeth remained uncontaminated throughout the test period. Fifty-nine percent (n = 10) of the specimens prepared with a burr showed leakage after 90 days, whilst only 22% (n = 4) of the ultrasonically prepared group showed leakage after the same time. The group prepared with ultrasonic tips showed statistically significant less specimens with leakage (P < 0.05) than the group prepared with burrs.
TI  - Bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. Artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. The reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1 mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (Actinomyces israelii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis). Bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. Ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% NaOCl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (P < 0.0001), whilst 12% NaOCl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. Ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% EDTA-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl killed A. israelii, F. nucleatum, P. acnes, S. mutans, and S. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for F. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in five samples out of 12. Ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated NaOCl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.
TI  - Functional changes in THP-1 human monocytic cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor.
AB  - A human THP-1 monocyte cell line culture system has been utilized to observe the  effect of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) supplementation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of oral microorganisms to stimulate monocyte/macrophage functional activity. LPS of oral microorganisms, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis was produced by phenol-water extraction and characterized. The phagocytosis assay was performed using F1TC labeled Saccharomyces yeast particles. Phagocytic functional activity was observed in 10-11% of resting THP-1 cells. Treatment of THP-1 cells with LPS of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis increased the phagocytic activity of THP-1 cells 2-3 fold. GM-CSF significantly increased phagocytosis either alone or when supplemented with LPS of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis. A chemotaxis assay was performed using a 48 well chemotaxis chamber. Chemotactic functional activity of THP-1 cells was increased 2-fold after 4 days of treatment with GM-CSF. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with LPS of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis significantly reduced the chemotactic activity indicating the maturation towards a fixed macrophage. There were functional variations (chemotaxis and phagocytosis) in THP-1 cells in response to LPS of oral microorganisms following stimulation with GM-CSF.
TI  - Microbiological findings in prepubertal periodontitis. A case report.
AB  - Generalized pre-pubertal periodontitis (GPP) is a rare entity that usually affects children with severe systemic diseases. We report the case of a 7-year-old male patient diagnosed with GPP, with no apparent systemic condition, who lost all his primary teeth to periodontal disease. Before extractions, while he was still in mixed dentition the subgingival plaque was collected and analyzed using DNA probes to 40 different microorganisms. Putative periodontopathogens such as Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas noxia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans could be identified throughout the mouth. More intriguing was the colonization of the sulcus of some secondary teeth by potentially harmful microorganisms found in pockets of diseased adjacent primary teeth.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Cytotoxic effect of endodontic bacteria on periapical fibroblasts.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (SBEs) from anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria on periapical fibroblast obtained from the apical portion of human periodontal ligaments. Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were chosen from among the endodontic bacteria isolated from root canals having a periapical lesion and compared in terms of their cytotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to examine which bacteria are involved in the development of periapical inflammation. The anaerobes were cultured under strict anaerobic conditions, and the bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation after incubation. The concentrated cell suspensions were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged. An SBE was made of each of the filtered supernatants. Each SBE was added to cultures of periapical fibroblasts. The cell growth and proliferation were measured by the MTT method after 3, 5, and 7 days. The SBEs from P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum inhibited the growth of the fibroblasts, whereas the SBE from P. intermedia did not inhibit it. The SBEs from P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum inhibited the fibroblast growth more strongly than did the P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum may participate in the development of periapical lesions.
TI  - Changes in bacterial populations in the colon of pigs fed different sources of dietary fibre, and the development of swine dysentery after experimental infection.
AB  - Swine dysentery (SD) is a disease which can be controlled by feeding a diet low in dietary fibre. The influence of source and inclusion level of dietary fibre both on bacterial populations in the colon, and on subsequent development of SD in pigs experimentally infected with Serpulina hyodysenteriae was evaluated. In Experiment 1, pigs were fed a low-fibre diet based on cooked rice and a animal protein supplement, or the same diet containing added insoluble (iNSP, fed as oaten chaff) or soluble (sNSP, fed as guar gum) non-starch polysaccharides, resistant starch (RS), or a combination of the last two (sNSP/RS). In Experiment 2, different levels of RS were added to the diet. With the base rice diet and with the addition of iNSP, the total number of colonic bacteria was low, the Gram-positive population predominated, S. hyodysenteriae did not colonize and SD did not develop. Synergistic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum and Fus. nucleatum), which have been reported to facilitate colonization by S. hyodysenteriae, were found only among isolates from pigs fed the sNSP/RS diet, and these animals developed SD. Addition of RS to the diet increased total bacterial counts and stimulated growth of Gram-negative bacteria in the colon. In Experiment 1, this permitted colonization by S. hyodysenteriae, but not expression of SD. In contrast, in Experiment 2, this level of inclusion and two others allowed both colonization and development of SD. In conclusion, the addition of sNSP and/or RS to an otherwise protective rice-based diet generated changes in the large intestine microbiota which might have some influence on proliferation of S. hyodysenteriae and the development of SD.
TI  - Analysis of pH-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  - Previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the pH  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. The aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated pH at which such shifts occurred. Nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. In one chemostat, pH control was discontinued for 6 h, and the pH fall was restricted to a minimum value of pH 5.5; the pH fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either pH 5. 0, or at pH 4.5. When the pH was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the pH fall. Veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially at low pH. The increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis). The counts of these species were relatively stable between pH 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the pH fell below pH 4.5; Neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at pH 4.5 or below. The data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low pH can be explained in terms of a two-stage process. A fall in pH to a value between pH 5.5 and 4.5 may allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. A further reduction in pH (<pH 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. The results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at pH values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.
TI  - Role of Fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  - Coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. The aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. Obligate anaerobes other than Fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. In contrast, F. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. The effects of the presence or absence of F. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% CO2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. In the presence of F. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). In an equivalent culture in the absence of F. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (P </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. Coaggregation-mediated interactions between F. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.
TI  - Early-onset periodontitis associated with Down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.
AB  - Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. The exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. As far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of DS patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (JP) disease pattern. The purpose of the present study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10 DS patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (CP) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. Subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of 12 weeks. The clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (P1), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, and Campylobacter rectus by DNA probes. The results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that DS patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. The mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth> 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in CP patients. Deep pockets in DS patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. Regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in DS patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. The missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in DS patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia and fungemia in patients undergoing endodontic therapy: an overview.
AB  - Oral focal infection, a concept neglected for several decades, is a subject of controversy. Recent progress in classification and identification of oral microorganisms has renewed interest in focal infection. The aim of this study was to use phenotypic and genetic methods to trace microorganisms released into the bloodstream during and after endodontic treatment back to their presumed source--the root canal. Microbiological samples were taken from the root canals of 26 patients with asymptomatic apical periodontitis of single-rooted teeth. The blood of the patients was drawn during and 10 minutes after endodontic therapy. Microorganisms in blood were collected after anaerobic lysis filtration and cultured anaerobically on blood agar plates. The phenotypic methods used for characterization and tracing of microorganisms in blood and root canals were: biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility test, SDS-PAGE of whole-cell soluble proteins, and gas chromatography of cellular fatty acids. Phenotypic data were verified by DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of the root canal and blood isolates by using a computer-assisted system fro gel analysis. All root canals contained anaerobic bacteria. The frequency of bacteremia varied from 31% to 54%. The microorganisms from the root canal and blood presented identical phenotype and genetic characteristics within the patients examined. These characteristics differed between patients. The present study demonstrated that endodontic treatment can be the cause of anaerobic bacteremia and fungemia. The phenotypic and genetic methods used appeared valuable for tracing microorganisms in the blood back to their origin.
TI  - Preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  - Opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (PTB) cases. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which Gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic species primarily among Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Mobiluncus; Mycoplasma hominis; and Ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. This BV complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, PTB, and other perinatal infectious complications. Pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. In the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. Also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely F. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. Although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to PTB.
TI  - Oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  - The present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. Secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. For this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and 14 were non-smokers. After achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. Plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. Microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of Actinomyces species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus species. At day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). The change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. Changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for Actinomyces species, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, and P. intermedia. Within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. No relationship with a single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. It is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profile of Papillon-Lefevre patients assessed by DNA-probes.
AB  - The prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridisation in a group of 12 Saudi-Arabian adolescents with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. A total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. The patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. All 12 patients harboured the putative bacterial pathogens P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. micros and S. intermedius while T. denticola, B. forsythus, P. nigrescens, E. corrodens, S. noxia and C. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. P. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for A. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. A number of the investigated species (B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. intermedia, C rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. On the other hand, bacteria such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were infrequently encountered at high levels in these subgingival samples. In conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a PLS-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - In vitro activity of HMR 3647 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to determine the in vitro activity of HMR 3647 compared with other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. The activity of HMR 3647 was determined against 342 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution method and was compared with azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. Among the macrolides HMR 3647 and among the beta-lactams imipenem were the most active agents tested. Anaerobic cocci (50 strains) had the following minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs): HMR 3647, range 0.016-0.125 mg/l; imipenem, range 0.016-0.064 mg/l. Propionibacterium acnes (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.032-0.064 mg/l. Clostridium perfringens (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.5 mg/l. Clostridium difficile (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125-256 mg/l; imipenem, 4.0-8.0 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis (102 strains): HMR 3647, 0.032-16 mg/l; imipenem, 0.064-0.25 mg/l. Bacteroides and Prevotella species (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-4.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.25 mg/l. Fusobacterium nucleatum (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-8.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.008-0.064 mg/l. HMR 3647 may be useful as treatment and prophylaxis for infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Expression of the peptide antibiotic human beta-defensin 1 in cultured gingival epithelial cells and gingival tissue.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) is a member of the family of small cationic antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mucosal epithelia. Because human gingival epithelium is a site that is constantly challenged by oral microorganisms, we examined the expression of hBD-1 in human gingival epithelial and fibroblast cell cultures and tissue samples. Cell cultures were challenged with cell wall extracts of Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or phorbol myristate acetate. hBD-1 mRNA was detected in unstimulated and stimulated cultures by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using several primer sets specific for hBD-1. Gingival epithelial cells, but not gingival fibroblasts, expressed a product of the predicted size for hBD-1 mRNA. The sequence of the PCR product was identical to that of hBD-1. hBD-1 mRNA expression was not significantly modulated by any of the stimulants tested. Human gingival tissues from noninflamed and inflamed sites were also analyzed by RT-PCR. hBD-1 mRNA was expressed in all tissue samples. The relative expression of hBD-1 mRNA was similar in noninflamed and inflamed tissues obtained from each of four patients undergoing treatment for periodontitis. However, the relative expression of hBD-1 mRNA varied in gingival biopsies obtained from 15 different normal individuals, and the relative hBD-1 expression was unrelated to interleukin-8 expression. Our findings show the constitutive expression of hBD-1 mRNA in cultured epithelial cells and gingival tissues but not gingival fibroblasts. These findings suggest that expression of hBD-1 may play a role as part of the innate host defenses in maintaining normal gingival health.
TI  - Bone resorption caused by three periodontal pathogens in vivo in mice is mediated in part by prostaglandin.
AB  - Gingival inflammation, bacterial infection, alveolar bone destruction, and subsequent tooth loss are characteristic features of periodontal disease, but the precise mechanisms of bone loss are poorly understood. Most animal models of the disease require injury to gingival tissues or teeth, and the effects of microorganisms are thus complicated by host responses to tissue destruction. To determine whether three putative periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, could cause localized bone resorption in vivo in the absence of tissue injury, we injected live or heat-killed preparations of these microorganisms into the subcutaneous tissues overlying the calvaria of normal mice once daily for 6 days and then examined the bones histologically. We found that all three microorganisms (both live and heat killed) stimulated bone resorption and that the strain of F. nucleatum used appeared to be the strongest inducer of osteoclast activity. Treatment of the mice concomitantly with indomethacin reduced but did not completely inhibit bone resorption by these microorganisms, suggesting that their effects were mediated, in part, by arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g., prostaglandins). Our findings indicate that these potential pathogens can stimulate bone resorption locally when placed beside a bone surface in vivo in the absence of prior tissue injury and support a role for them in the pathogenesis of bone loss around teeth in periodontitis.
TI  - An aminopeptidase nutritionally important to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The properties of an aminopeptidase (AP) from Fusobacterium nucleatum were studied in view of the fact that this organism, along with other Gram-negative anaerobes involved in periodontal diseases, survives in the subgingival environment by obtaining energy via the fermentation of a small number of peptide-derived amino acids. The AP was found to be cell-associated and was isolated from disrupted chemostat-grown cells. It was purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, two column chromatographic steps and IEF. The enzyme was found to have a molecular mass of 54 kDa, a pI of 5.1, a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8.0 and, using Leu-Ala as substrate, it gave K(m) and Vmax values of 0.66 mM and 0.12 mumol min-1 mg-1, respectively. No complete homology was found between the N-terminal sequence of the first 20 amino acids (MDXKXYVDLKERFLRYVKFN...) and any other published sequence, but residues 8-20 gave a 62% match with residues 9-21 of an AP from Haemophilus influenzae. The enzyme was inactivated by chelating agents, bestatin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and some heavy metals. Cobalt ions restored EDTA-inactivated activity but did not reverse inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline. In addition, bestatin and 1,10-phenanthroline had an inhibitory effect on the batch growth of F. nucleatum in a complex medium in which peptidase activities would be nutritionally essential. No such inhibition was observed in a chemically defined medium in which growth was not dependent upon peptidase activities. The peptidase described in this paper therefore appears to be a cobalt-activated metallo-AP which, together with other peptidases, is considered to be important in the survival of F. nucleatum in the subgingival environment of the mouth.
TI  - Experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  - A small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) mice. The selected microorganisms were: Porphyromonas endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Eubacterium lentum (ATCC 25559), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083). Only P. anaerobius, E. coli, and E. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both CV and GF mice. E. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in CV animals. P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were unable to colonize in CV and GF animals after single inoculation. It is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
TI  - Clonal analysis by ribotyping of Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates obtained from healthy young adults with optimal plaque control.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic rod implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. However, this organism has also been frequently identified in high numbers in healthy adults. These observations suggest that the species may comprise different clonal types, some of which may participate in disease. The purpose of the present investigation was to use restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and ribotyping to characterize F. nucleatum clonal types isolated from healthy young adults with optimal plaque control and investigate the stability of some of these clonal types. A group comprising 11 dental students and 11 dental outpatients with optimal plaque control was sampled. Clonal stability was investigated by sampling the dental student group at baseline and at 16 months. One hundred and thirty-two clinical isolates of F. nucleatum were successfully recovered from 15/22 individuals. For the positive subjects, 29 different clonal types were identified by REA and ribotyping, each subject and site being colonized by 1-4 clonal types. For the dental students, 9 and 15 different clonal types were identified at baseline and 16 months, respectively. None of the students harboured identical clonal types at both sampling times. Our results show that ribotyping is a useful technique for monitoring the distributions of F. nucleatum clonal types and indicate that healthy individuals with optimal plaque control can be colonized by more than one F. nucleatum clonal type and that these clonal types appear to be unstable.
TI  - Dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of Treponema denticola.
AB  - Prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by Treponema denticola. The gene, prtP, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (K. Ishihara, T. Miura, H. K. Kuramitsu, and K. Okuda, Infect. Immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). In order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of T. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, K1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtP-inactivated DNA fragment. No chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. In addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of the organism decreased in the mutant. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with Fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. The results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. These results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of T. denticola. The loss of dentilsin activity and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of T. denticola.
TI  - Severity of localized juvenile periodontitis as related to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and specific microbial isolates.
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine if an association exists  between severity of localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) and impairment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotaxis and/or colonization by specific microbial isolates; (b) to determine if the number of specific microbial isolates, i.e., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Campylobacter rectus correlates to clinical severity of sites with LJP. Thirty-six first molars in nine subjects with LJP were examined. A clinical severity score was computed based on attachment level and vertical bone loss. The mean score of the four sites was designated as the clinical severity score for each subject. A DNA probe was used to quantitate colonization by A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, E. corrodens, and C. rectus. The chemotaxis of isolated peripheral blood PMNs was measured in Boyden chambers using the leading front technique. It was found that the clinical severity score ranged from 7.8 for mild involvement to 32.5 for severe LJP. The chemotaxis result for each patient (micron/90 min) was expressed as a percentage of the value for a paired healthy control and ranged from 40% to 104%. Four of the nine subjects had chemotaxis values less than 70% of control. Linear regression analysis showed: (a) no significant correlation between PMN chemotaxis and severity of LJP in subjects (r = .14); (b) a significant correlation (r = 0.43) between severe sites with LJP and number of specific microbial isolates. Sites with severe LJP had present at least five different microbial isolates as compared with non-severe sites (P < .05). No particular trend of colonization by periodontopathogens was seen in non-severe sites. Further, severe sites of LJP displayed a statistically significant greater colonization by P. intermedia, E. corrodens, and C. rectus than did non-severe sites (P < .05). It may be concluded that neither the degree of PMN chemotactic impairment nor A. actinomycetemcomitans is a reliable indicator of the severity of LJP.
TI  - Subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Age was inversely associated with the GO. Plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with GO, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of GO. The gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the GO. Statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of GO were detected for Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium and Selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. Significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species Eubacterium alactolyticum, Campylobacter concisus, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, F. mortiferum, F. nucleatum, and F. varium from the more enlarged lesions (GO >3).
TI  - The effect of herbal extracts in an experimental mouthrinse on established plaque and gingivitis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to establish in vitro the inhibiting effect  of a herbal extract mixture on a selected number of micro-organisms and to test in vivo the effect of a mouthwash containing 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture on plaque and gingivitis as compared to a minus active control mouthrinse. The herbal extract was a mixture of: Juniperus communis (juniper), Urtica dioca (nettle), Achillaea millefolium (yarrow); 1:1:1. In the study, in-vitro, the effect of pure herbal extract mixture on acid production of Streptococcus mutans was tested and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the following micro-organisms were tested: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actynomyces viscosus, Actynomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella parvula. The MIC-values for A. viscosus and P. gingivalis were 100 mg/ml. The MIC-values for A. naeslundii and A. actinomycetemcomitans were considerably lower (10 mg/ml). S. mitis was the most susceptible of the tested organisms to the extract with a MIC value of 1 mg/ml. S. mutans, C. rectus, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum were not influenced by the extracts. No inhibitory effect of the 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture was observed on the acid production of S. mutans. For the study in-vivo, 45 volunteers were selected on the basis of having moderate gingival inflammation. As efficacy parameters the plaque index, modified gingival index and angulated bleeding index were assessed. The subjects were randomly divided among 3 experimental groups (2x test and 1 'minus active' control). The participants were requested to rinse with 10 ml of mouthwash twice a day for a period of three months. After 6 weeks and 3 months, the same clinical indices as at baseline were recorded. The results show no difference between the two test groups and the control group. In conclusion, the results of the present study have shown that the mixture of the 3 herbal extracts, Juniperus communis, Urtica dioca and Achillaea millefolium when used in a mouthrinse has no effect on plaque growth and gingival health.
TI  - Development of an anaerobic bacterial leakage model.
AB  - The majority of bacteria associated with infections of endodontic origin are strict anaerobes. The purpose of this study was to develop an endodontic microleakage model using strict anaerobic bacteria in a two-chamber system. Nine species of anaerobic bacteria were tested for viability and detection by either turbidity or color change of the broth. A survey of pH chromogenic substrates revealed that bromcresol purple (pH 5.2 = yellow, pH 6.8 = purple) could be used as a chromogenic indicator to detect the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth (PYG) and brain heart infusion broth (BHI) were each used alone and with bromcresol purple (bpPYG, bpBHI) in this study. Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum were viable in all four media for > 2 wk and produced both turbidity and a color change after only 1 day of incubation. Veillonella parvula in either bpBHI or BHI and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in either bpPYG or BHI were viable for > 2 wk and showed a color change or turbidity after 1 or 2 days. The results indicate that leakage of strict anaerobes may be evaluated in a two-chamber system.
TI  - Studies on fusobacteria associated with periodontal diseases.
AB  - The physiological and metabolic characteristics of representative isolates of the various subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum were investigated by growing them in continuous culture in chemically-defined, media. Behaving almost identically, these organisms were found to obtain energy from the fermentation of simple carbohydrates such as glucose or fructose or from the fermentation of certain amino acids, free or in the form of small peptides. The latter can be attacked by aminopeptidase activity which was shown to be essential for the growth of the organism in an environment lacking fermentable carbohydrate and free amino acids but replete with small peptides. This metabolic versatility may explain the presence of F. nucleatum in both supra- and sub-gingival dental plaque and why it is often found together with organisms such as Porphyromonas gingivalis which display powerful endopeptidase activities. Using the technique of allozyme electrophoresis, the current subspeciation of F. nucleatum was shown to be of doubtful validity and evidence, based upon physiological and metabolic properties, for differences in pathogenicity between isolates was not detected. While this organism is a member of various bacterial consortia associated with periodontal diseases, its contribution to the disease process remains unclear.
TI  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor amplification of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in THP-1 human monocytic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms.
AB  - Cytokines, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), are used to assist in bone marrow recovery during cancer chemotherapy. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) play important roles in inflammatory processes, including exacerbation of periodontal diseases, one of the most common complications in patients who undergo this therapy. A human monocyte cell line (THP-1) was utilized to investigate IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production following GM-CSF supplementation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from two oral microorganisms, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. LPS of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum was prepared by a phenol-water extraction method and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determination of total protein and endotoxin contents. Resting THP-1 cells were treated with LPS of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum and/or GM-CSF (50 IU/ml) by using different concentrations for various time periods. Production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in THP-1 cells was measured by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to evaluate the gene expression of resting and treated THP-1 cells. IL-1beta was not detected in untreated THP-1 cells. IL-1beta production was, however, stimulated sharply at 4 h. GM-CSF amplified IL-1beta production in THP-1 cells treated with LPS from both oral anaerobes. No IL-1beta-specific mRNA transcript was detected in untreated THP-1 cells. However, IL-1beta mRNA was detected by RT-PCR 2 h after stimulation of THP-1 cells with LPS from both organisms. GM-CSF did not shorten the IL-1beta transcriptional activation time. GM-CSF plus F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis LPS activated THP-1 cells to produce a 1.6-fold increase in TNF-alpha production at 4 h over LPS stimulation alone. These investigations with the in vitro THP-1 model indicate that there may be an increase in the cellular immune response to oral endotoxin following GM-CSF therapy, as evidenced by production of the tissue-reactive cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha.
TI  - Volatile fatty acid, metabolic by-product of periodontopathic bacteria, induces apoptosis in WEHI 231 and RAJI B lymphoma cells and splenic B cells.
AB  - The ability of butyric acid, an extracellular metabolite from periodontopathic bacteria, to induce apoptosis in murine WEHI 231 cells, splenic B cells, and human RAJI cells was examined. The culture filtrate of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, which contains high a percentage of butyric acid, induced DNA fragmentation in WEHI 231 cells. Volatile fatty acid, especially butyric acid, significantly suppressed B-cell viability in a concentration-dependent fashion. The DNA fragmentation assay indicated that butyric acid rapidly induced apoptosis in WEHI 231 cells (with 1.25 mM butyric acid and 6 h after treatment), splenic B cells (with 1.25 mM butyric acid), and RAJI cells (with 2.5 mM butyric acid). Incubation of WEHI 231 cells with butyric acid for 16 h resulted in the typical ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation and the apoptoic change such as chromatin condensation and hypodiploid nuclei. Cell cycle analysis implied that butyric acid arrested the cells at the G1 phase. The inhibitory assay suggested that butyric acid-induced apoptosis of WEHI 231 and splenic B cells was inhibited by W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor. These results suggest that calmodulin-dependent regulation is involved in the signal transduction pathway of butyric acid.
TI  - Activities of HMR 3004 (RU 64004) and HMR 3647 (RU 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  - The activities of HMR 3004 and HMR 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. HMR 3004 and HMR 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [Bacteroides tectum, Porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), Prevotella heparinolytica, Porphyromonas sp., Prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except Fusobacterium nucleatum (HMR 3004, MIC90 = 16 microg/ml; HMR 3647, MIC90 = 8 microg/ml) and other Fusobacterium species (MIC90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). In general, HMR 3004 and HMR 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. Azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all Pasteurella species, including Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against Corynebacterium species, Weeksella zoohelcum, B. tectum, and P. heparinolytica.
TI  - Trovafloxacin compared with levofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin  and clarithromycin against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite-wound pathogens.
AB  - The activity of trovafloxacin and five other oral agents against 250 aerobic and  137 anaerobic strains isolated from human and animal bite wounds was determined by an agar dilution method. Trovafloxacin was active against all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates at < or = 0.5 mg/L and all anaerobes at < or = 2 mg/L (Bacteroides tectum, Porphyromonas salivosa and Prevotella heparinolytica, < or = 0.25 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.5 mg/L; Prevotella spp. and peptostreptococci, < or = 2.0 mg/L), except Fusobacterium nucleatum and other fusobacteria (MIC90 < or = 4 mg/L). Levofloxacin was generally one to two dilutions more active than ofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin was active against aerobes (MIC < or = 1 mg/L) but less active against anaerobic strains (MIC90 < or = 16 mg/L).
TI  - Helicobacter pylori adheres selectively to Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori strains ATCC 43504 and ATCC 43629 were tested for their ability to coaggregate with 79 strains of bacteria representing 16 genera. All except two of the strains were of human origin, and most of the strains were isolated from the oral cavity. The helicobacters failed to coaggregate with all strains except the fusobacteria. Several coaggregations were partially or completely inhibited by lactose. Strong coaggregation was seen with each of four subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum and with Fusobacterium periodonticum ATCC 33693, all of human dental plaque origin. In contrast, the helicobacters failed to coaggregate with non-plaque isolates, Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557 and Fusobacterium ulcerans ATCC 49185. Heat treatment of the fusobacteria inactivated their ability to coaggregate, whereas heating of the Helicobacter partners had no effect, suggesting the presence of an adhesin on the fusobacteria and a corresponding receptor on the helicobacters. The potential ability of H. pylori to colonize the oral cavity by adhering selectively to the ubiquitous fusobacteria gives credence to the possibility that dental plaque may serve as a reservoir for this pathogen outside of the stomach.
TI  - Characterization of a novel N-acetylneuraminic acid-specific Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 adhesin.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of F. nucleatum PK1594. Four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5H11, 14C7, 19F2 and 29C12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of F. nucleatum PK1594 with Actinomyces israelii PK16. They were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including Streptococcus oralis H1, S. oralis J22, Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC33596, Prevotella denticola PK1277 and Prevotella intermedia PK1511. All of these interactions were completely inhibited by N-acetylneuraminic acid. Neither N-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody 5H11 had any inhibitory effect on other F. nucleatum PK1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. The results indicate that F. nucleatum PK1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by N-acetylneuraminic acid.
TI  - Acid tolerance and acid-neutralizing activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The tolerance to acid and the acid-neutralizing activity of three important periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum were studied. P. gingivalis strains grew only at neutral pH and did not utilize glucose, whereas strains of P. intermedia and F. nucleatum could grow under acidic conditions and increased their growth by utilizing glucose. P. gingivalis tended to raise the culture pH during growth. P. intermedia and F. nucleatum raised the culture pH during growth in the absence of glucose, while in the presence of glucose they decreased the pH. Resting cell suspensions of all the bacteria raised the pH in the presence of tryptone and casamino acids. Acid-neutralizing activity was confirmed by measuring base production at a fixed pH with a pH-stat. During neutralization, the cells produced cytotoxic substrates, ammonia and organic acids (butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acids by P. gingivalis; isovaleric and succinic acids by P. intermedia; propionic and butyric acids by F. nucleatum). These findings suggest that deamination of amino acids into ammonia and organic acids occurs simultaneously with base production, resulting in acid neutralization. These results could partially explain the survival of P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in both supragingival and subgingival plaque and the apparent restriction of P. gingivalis to subgingival plaque. The former bacteria may aid in creation of an environment fostering colonization of subgingival plaque by P. gingivalis.
TI  - Effect of red blood cells on the growth of Porphyromonas endodontalis and microbial community development.
AB  - Establishment of a microbial community in the root canal system depends on numerous factors, of which nutrient availability may be one of the most important. We hypothesized that the presence of red blood cells or hemoglobin in this environment could cause shifts in microbial composition of communities, resulting in organisms such as Porphyromonas endodontalis becoming more dominant. An in vitro model system using mixed, batch cultures was performed with the bacteria P. endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Campylobacter rectus. Bacteria were cultured in media with or without the addition of washed red blood cells, hemoglobin, or serum. Cyclic growth studies revealed that P. endodontalis was lost from the community of organisms after three cycles. However, inclusion of red blood cells resulted in establishment of this organism. Moreover, red blood cells added to pure cultures of P. endodontalis substantially enhanced growth and protected the organisms from oxygen. We conclude that the presence of red blood cells could result in shifts of microbial communities of organisms within the root canal system.
TI  - Beta-sheet antibiotic peptides as potential dental therapeutics.
AB  - Small, cysteine-rich, beta-sheet peptide antibiotics are found throughout the Animalia. Though broad spectrum in potential, they may exert selective antimicrobial effects under certain conditions. We have explored the antimicrobial properties of two families of beta-sheet peptide antibiotics, defensins and protegrins, against periodontopathic bacteria. The rabbit defensin NP-1 was active against facultative Gram-negative bacteria associated with early onset periodontitis, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the Capnocytophaga spp. Porcine protegrins showed even greater activity against those organisms, as well as against anaerobic bacteria associated with adult periodontitis, including Porphyromonas gingivalis Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Based on these observations, we believe that protegrin-like beta-sheet peptide antibiotics may be useful dental therapeutics.
TI  - Perforation repair comparing mineral trioxide aggregate and amalgam using an anaerobic bacterial leakage model.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and amalgam to seal furcal perforations in extracted human molars using an anaerobic bacterial leakage model. Furcal perforations were made in 39 maxillary and mandibular human molars with a high-speed bur. These were randomly divided into two experimental groups of 18, with the remaining three teeth used as positive controls. Experimental group 1 was repaired with MTA and group 2 with amalgam. Three additional teeth without perforations served as negative controls. A dual chamber anaerobic bacterial leakage model was assembled. Brain heart infusion broth with yeast extract, hemin, menadione, and the chromogenic indicator bromcresol purple was used as the culture broth for Fusobacterium nucleatum. Eight of 18 amalgam samples leaked, whereas none of the 18 MTA samples leaked. MTA was significantly better than amalgam in preventing leakage of F. nucleatum past furcal perforation repairs.
TI  - Killing of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia by protegrins.
AB  - Protegrins are broad spectrum antibiotic peptides isolated from porcine leukocytes. In this study, we (i) examine the sensitivity of Gram-negative, anaerobic periodontal pathogens to synthetic protegrins; (ii) determine the relative potencies of protegrin congeners against these bacteria; and (iii) compare the potency of protegrins with other antibiotic peptides, including magainin MSI-78, tachyplesin I, cecropin P1, human defensins HNP-1-3, and clavanin A. Synthetic L- and D-enantiomers of protegrin 1 (PG-1 and D-PG-1, respectively), and L-enantiomers of protegrins 2, 3 and 5 (PG-2, PG-3 and PG-5) were tested against Fusobacterium nucleatum, and black-pigmented organisms including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. Strains of both F. nucleatum and the black-pigmented organisms were sensitive to PG-1, and exhibited mean ED99 of 2.2-2.3 micrograms/ml and 3.4-9.9 micrograms/ml, respectively. The D-form was statistically more potent than the L-form against these oral anaerobes, and although this difference in potency is unlikely to be of decisive therapeutic significance, the D-form may be of value given ability to resist microbial and host-derived proteases. PG-1 was more potent than magainin, tachyplesin, cecropin, defensins and clavanin under test conditions. Hypertonic salt concentrations and heat-inactivated serum were found to be inhibitory to the bactericidal activity of PG-1. PG-1 was found to induce morphologic alterations in the ultrastructural appearance of F. nucleatum consistent with damage to the bacterial membranes. We conclude that protegrins may be useful antimicrobial agents in therapy against Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria believed to be involved in chronic, adult forms of periodontal infections.
TI  - An evaluation of microbial coronal leakage in the restored pulp chamber of root-canal treated multirooted teeth.
AB  - This in vitro study investigated the effect of a resin-reinforced glass ionomer lining material on the coronal leakage of a mixed obligate microbial marker in maxillary molars obturated with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha and Tubliseal sealer, after 2 years' storage. Forty maxillary first molars were prepared chemomechanically to a size 30-40 master apical file. The teeth were divided into an experimental group (30 teeth) and control group (10 teeth). In the experimental group, the floor of pulp chamber and the root-canal opening of 15 teeth were covered with Vitrebond as a lining; the remaining 15 teeth received no lining. These teeth were tested for leakage using a microbiological marker consisting of anaerobic streptococci and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The teeth were checked daily for bacterial leakage for 60 days. All positive control teeth leaked within 48 h, while the negative control teeth remained uncontaminated throughout the test period. The teeth restored with Vitrebond liner showed no leakage whilst 60% of the specimens with no Vitrebond liner showed leakage after 60 days.
TI  - Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-HCl.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-HCl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease in bacterial susceptibility. Twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. After subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-HCl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. The lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. The distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of minocycline-HCl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-HCl concentration equal to or less than the MIC for reference strains. However, some clinical strains of Prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. There were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. The concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - In vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC-9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus sp. The strains were cultivated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), with the exception of F. nucleatum (BHI-PRAS). Pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. Paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. Incubation was conducted at 37 degrees C for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. The antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on M. luteus and F. nucleatum, 24 h on Streptococcus sp, 48 h on E. coli, and 72 h on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Mixture II (M. luteus + Streptococcus sp + S. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture I (M. luteus + E. coli + P. aeruginosa), mixture III (E. coli + P. aeruginosa), and mixture IV (S. aureus + P. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
TI  - [Pulmonary infection caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum].
AB  - Thoracic infection by anaerobes are uncommon diseases and often presents difficulty in diagnosis. We report a case of thoracic infection due to Fusobacterium Nucleatum. A 60-year old man presented a lesion infiltrating from the lung to the thoracic wall. Fusobacterium Nucleatum was isolated on pus collected. Treatment by penicillin, metronidazole combined with surgical drainage was highly effective.
TI  - Salivary IgA responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and HIV infection status.
AB  - Levels of total IgA and specific IgA reactive with Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by ELISA in parotid saliva from HIV+ and HIV- persons with healthy gingiva (HG), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (CMP), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP). When the HIV+ group was compared with the HIV- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary IgA concentration was higher in HIV+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total IgA output. HIV+ CMP displayed higher total IgA concentration as compared with HIV- CMP. No significant differences in specific IgA outputs and ratios were detected between HIV+ and HIV- subgroups with similar periodontal status. HIV+ NUP displayed increased specific IgA output towards S. mutans and increased specific IgA ratio values towards S. mutans, P. gingivalis and P. nigrescens as compared with HIV+ CMP, and increased specific IgA ratio values towards S. mutans and P. nigrescens as compared with HIV+ HG. No such differences were observed between the HIV- subgroups. In sum, salivary IgA responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and HIV infection, but are possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.
TI  - Evaluation of root canal bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility in teeth with necrotic pulp.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of necrotic pulp in teeth without carious lesions where the crown and root were intact and to test the sensitivity of this microbiota to antibiotics in order to improve treatment. The necrotic pulp was sampled from 26 single-rooted teeth in intact pulp chambers. A total of 84 strains were isolated. The number of species isolated per tooth varied from 2 to 8, with a strong component (81%) of anaerobic bacteria. The most commonly represented species were Bacteroides gracilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella buccae and Eubacterium lentum. The sensitivity of these organisms to amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate and tetracycline was evaluated by Etest on 38 isolates. For all strains tested, the minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained were low and substantially below effective serum concentrations for these antibiotics. These data enable us to devise suitable treatments for acute development of apical lesions and to prevent dissemination of this source of infection to the rest of the host.
TI  - Subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  - There have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) components. Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and GCF levels of neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), beta-glucuronidase (BG), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1), and interferon alpha (IFN). Furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. The plaque index (PI), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. GCF was sampled following the measurement of the PI and removal of the supragingival plaque. GCF samples were assayed for the enzymes NE, BG, MPO and the cytokines IFN-alpha and IL-1 alpha. A sterile Gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. The plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. Subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). Significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and NE (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), MPO (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and BG (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). Temperature was found to correlate positively with E. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and F. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with P. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), P. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p = 0.1) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). In conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the GCF enzymes, NE, MPO and BG as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.
TI  - Conversion of DL-threonine, D-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by Fusobacterium species.
AB  - The present investigation examined DL-threonine, D-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate conversion into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by various type strains and clinical isolates of Fusobacterium. Except for Fus. naviforme, the type strains were able to produce varying degrees of propionate and/or 2-hydroxybutyrate from DL-threonine. Additionally, D-threonine was converted into an equimolar amount of propionate by Fus. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, Fus. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and Fus. varium, and to a lower but significant amount by Fus. mortiferum and Fus. perfoetens. However, the level of propionate remained unchanged for Fus. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme, Fus. nucleatum subsp. vincentii, Fus. naviforme, Fus. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme, Fus. gonidiaforme and Fus. russii. 2-Oxobutyrate was fermented to propionate by all type strains, although Fus. russii reduced it mainly to 2-hydroxybutyrate. Thus, an attempt was made to make use of these features in order to identify clinical isolates.
TI  - Comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern Cameroon.
AB  - Our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult Cameronians. The aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched Cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction. We also compared cultivation and the Affirm DP test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined and the results were compared statistically. Each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. Results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of the 18 bacterial species. The Gram-positive species Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. Cultivation demonstrated P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared to the checkerboard technique. Furthermore, the Affirm DP test detected P. gingivalis and B. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the Affirm DP test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. Overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the healthy and diseased adult Cameronians were similar to those reported for adults in the West and in some developing countries.
TI  - Reduced serum IgG reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in HIV-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  - Serum samples were obtained from 44 HIV-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. Serum IgG and IgA reactivities towards Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of ELISA. HIV+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower IgG reactivities to the periodontal pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum as compared with their HIV- counterparts (p < 0.05). Specific serum IgA reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for P. nigrescens where the HIV+ group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). The results indicate that HIV infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in HIV-infected patients.
TI  - "Checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The present study compared the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect to the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled DNA probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial test panels. We found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data. If the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. The use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87. The checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. It was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.
TI  - Identification of a Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 galactose-binding adhesin which mediates coaggregation with periopathogenic bacteria and hemagglutination.
AB  - Attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum to various oral surfaces is mediated by several adhesins anchored on its outer surface. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were prepared and used to identify the putative galactose-binding adhesin of F. nucleatum PK1594. Four unique MAbs, 8G7, 26B9, 28G11, and 29D4, were isolated on the basis of their ability to inhibit coaggregation of F. nucleatum PK1594 with Porphyromonas gingivalis PK1924. All four MAbs were also capable of inhibiting galactose-inhibitable interactions of F. nucleatum PK1594 with other oral gram-negative bacteria and with erythrocytes. Preincubation of F. nucleatum PK1594 with MAb 26B9 or its Fab fragments at concentrations lower than 1 microg/ml resulted in complete inhibition of coaggregation with P. gingivalis PK1924 or hemagglutination. F. nucleatum PK1594 surface components prepared by mild sonication or by extracting whole cells with detergents were subjected to Western blot analysis. None of the MAbs were able to recognize any polypeptide in these experiments. Therefore, detergent extracts of F. nucleatum PK1594 surface components were subjected to three experimental procedures: (i) separation by ion-exchange chromatography and testing of fractions for reaction with MAb 26B9 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), (ii) lactose-Sepharose affinity chromatography and testing of the lactose eluate in ELISA with MAb 26B9, and (iii) immunoseparation with either MAb 26B9 or 8G7. Collectively, the results suggest that the putative adhesin is a 30-kDa outer membrane polypeptide which mediates the coaggregation with P. gingivalis PK1924 as well as other galactose-sensitive interactions of F. nucleatum PK1594.
TI  - Putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - This study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (EOP) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of U.S. young adults. The subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. The attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using DNA probes. The individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental EOP, and no-periodontitis groups based on the extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the 6 preceding years. In the EOP groups there were significantly higher percentages of individuals with detectable levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Treponema denticola. In addition, the EOP group had significantly higher levels of these 5 microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. There were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. In a descending order of importance, P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and P. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. F. nucleatum and C. rectus were also associated with EOP, but to a lesser degree. In the present population Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with EOP, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized EOP. Eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. The results show that several bacterial species are associated with EOP, and that P. gingivalis and T. denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of EOP.
TI  - Cross-infection from periodontitis sites to failing implant sites in the same mouth.
AB  - Twenty-five tooth and implant sites in nine patients were investigated for the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms, using specific DNA probes for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, and Campylobacter recta. Five of nine patients showed a likelihood of transmission from tooth to implant sites. These patients also showed a high number of putative periodontopathic organisms present in the tooth sites tested. A significant risk was found of transmitting putative periodontopathic organisms from periodontitis sites to implant sites in the same mouth. An appropriate clinical protocol needs to be developed to address this issue.
TI  - Experimental gingivitis in periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical, microbiological, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) profiles in periodontitis-resistant and periodontitis-susceptible subjects during 4 weeks of experimental gingivitis. Experimental groups of similar ages were defined as gingivitis controls (GC; n = 10) and history of rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP; n = 10), respectively. Prior to baseline, all subjects achieved good plaque control (plaque index (P1I) approximately 0) and gingival health (gingival index (GI) = 0), and had probing depths < or = 4 mm on experimental teeth. For 4 weeks after baseline, oral hygiene around maxillary 2nd premolar and 1st molar teeth was inhibited by a plaque guard. The plaque guard was removed weekly for GCF sampling to determine interleukin (IL)-1 beta and prostaglandin (PG)E2 amounts by ELISAs. In addition, P1I, GI, probing depth, and gingival recession measurements were made. Subgingival plaque darkfield microscopy and DNA probe analysis also were performed. Results indicated that clinical signs of inflammation, microbiological patterns and GCF profiles progressed similarly in both groups. However, plaque accumulated more rapidly in the susceptible subjects. P1I in RPP at 4 weeks was 2.1 +/- 0.1 compared to 1.5 +/- 0.2 in GC, with an incidence of P1I > of 100% versus 50%, respectively (logistic regression; p < 0.0001). Hence, the clinical, microbiological and host factors selected for this study were unrelated to previous susceptibility to periodontitis when evaluated in the experimental gingivitis model. However, the increased rate of plaque accumulation, following thorough plaque removal, in RPP patients suggests a potential factor in disease recurrence in these susceptible subjects.
TI  - Coronal leakage of mixed anaerobic bacteria after obturation and post space preparation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess bacterial leakage of a mixed  anaerobic community of organisms in obturated canals after post space preparation. STUDY DESIGN: A mixed microbial community of strict anaerobic organisms (F. nucleatum, P. micros and C. rectus) was developed. With the use of an in vitro model system, coronal leakage was assessed in 40 anterior teeth after obturation and post space preparation. The specific leakage time in days for each organism to penetrate through the obturating material was determined. In addition, colonization of the apical canal space was assessed by scanning electron microscope after longitudinal splitting of randomly selected specimens. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the teeth demonstrated coronal leakage of F. nucleatum and C. rectus by the 90 day interval. Bacterial penetration occurred from 48 days to 84 days. Scanning electron microscope examination showed a heterogeneous biofilm of coccal and bacillary species colonizing the apical portion of the canal wall. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that coronal leakage phenomena do occur after loss of coronal seals. The model system developed using mixed, anaerobic bacterial cultures is more clinically relevant and may be used to assess bacterial penetration through gutta percha obturation.
TI  - Pore-forming molecules in gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Little information is available about porin molecules in anaerobes. Porins from Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Campylobacter species have been described. A pore-forming outer membrane (OM) porin protein was isolated from B. fragilis (Omp-200); it is exposed at the cell surface and dissociated by boiling and application of reducing agents. Fusobacterium nucleatum FomA, an OM porin protein of 40 kD, had a deduced topology of FomA similar to that of established porins, despite the lack of sequence similarity. An OM preparation from Porphyromonas endodontalis (including a major protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD and other proteins of 40.3-71.6 kD) formed pores in a liposome assay. A major outer membrane protein (MOMP) from Campylobacter jejuni (a microaerophile) is related to the family of trimeric bacterial porins, although little homology was seen with other porins. The development of antimicrobial resistance related to decreased permeability underlines the importance of identifying and characterizing the pore-forming molecules of anaerobes.
TI  - Dental implant infections.
AB  - Dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. Osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. A tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. Titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. A small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. The microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. Implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. Infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection.
TI  - Recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  - A new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16S rRNA sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. The pigmented Prevotella species now comprise seven species including P. nigrescens and P. tannerae; P. intermedia/P. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. The former Mitsuokella dentalis and Hallella seregens were transferred to Prevotella as one species, P. dentalis. P. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting Prevotella. The genus Porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, P. catoniae; P. levii-like and P. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. Fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies, and F. varium includes the former F. pseudonecrophorum. Former Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva now are Campylobacter rectus and Campylobacter curvus; Campylobacter showae is a new species. Isolates included in the bile-sensitive former Bacteroides gracilis now are Campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant B. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, Sutterella, as S. wadsworthensis. The new Actinomyces species include two subspecies of the A. neuii and the A. radingae-A. turicensis complex. The genus Eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by E. limosum, and the former E. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, Pseudoramibacter, as P. alactolyticus. Recent entries include E. saphenum, E. minutum, E. exiguum, E. infirmum, and E. tardum. A new genus, Atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. The genus Peptostreptococcus also have four new species; P. hydrogenalis, P. lacrimalis, P. lactolyticus, and P. vaginalis.
TI  - Enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Model biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. Plaque-resembling biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. Glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. A complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have a significant bactericidal activity. Combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.
TI  - Increased susceptibility of RAG-2 SCID mice to dissemination of endodontic infections.
AB  - Specific immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions,  although the extent to which these mechanisms are actually involved in either protection or destruction of the pulp-periapex complex is yet to be established. To investigate this question we compared periapical-lesion pathogenesis in RAG-2 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with immunocompetent control mice following surgical pulp exposure. In order to equalize the bacterial challenge, an infection protocol using Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius was devised. The results demonstrated that after infection, the proportion of the root canal flora represented by the four pathogens was almost identical in both groups (39.9 and 42.2% for RAG-2 and immunocompetent control mice, respectively). The effects of abrogation of T- and B-cell mechanisms on periapical pathogenesis were then assessed. Approximately one-third of the RAG-2 mice developed endodontic abscesses, while no immunocompetent controls had abscesses, results which indicated regional dissemination of the infection. A similar incidence of abscesses was found in two additional experiments. Abscessed RAG-2 teeth had significantly larger periapical lesions than did nonabscessed RAG-2 teeth (P < or = 0.05) and exposed immunocompetent controls (P < or = 0.01), whereas nonabscessed RAG-2 teeth were not significantly different from those of exposed immunocompetent controls in periapical-lesion size. We conclude that B- and T-cell-mediated immunity protects the host from the dissemination of endodontic infections and that RAG-2 mice are more susceptible to infection-induced pulp-periapex destruction.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and clonal analysis of oral Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates.
AB  - F. nucleatum is the most commonly isolated microorganism from subgingival plaque, but the role of this microorganism in periodontal diseases remains undefined. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) was evaluated as a method for fingerprinting F. nucleatum isolates and for use in clonal analysis. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to further differentiate F. nucleatum isolates, with identical AP-PCR patterns. Extremely heterogeneous AP-PCR fingerprints were observed among the 98 F. nucleatum isolates, with 36 different genotypes observed with primer C1 and 30 different genotype detected with primer C2. Combining the results of the AP-PCR genotype analysis from C1 and C2 primer amplifications revealed that up to 7 different genotypes could be distinguished from isolates from the same oral cavity and that up to 4 different genotypes were observed within a single site. An intense amplicon at approximately 450 bp generated in AP-PCR amplification with primer C2 was associated with F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum (ATCC 25586) and with 15 F. nucleatum isolates from diseased sites and 2 isolates from healthy sites. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis confirmed the AP-PCR genotypes and demonstrated increased discriminatory power over AP-PCR. The results indicated that AP-PCR and pulsed field gel electrophoresis provide a simple and sensitive means for differentiating oral F. nucleatum isolates and further demonstrate the heterogeneity of this species. These techniques may serve as useful tools in the clonal and epidemiological analysis of F. nucleatum isolates, which may help define the role of these microorganisms in periodontal diseases.
TI  - Characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates to cell envelope and cell wall antigens from periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The immune response of the primate, Macaca fascicularis, to cell envelope (CEA) or cell wall (CWA) antigens of several periodontal pathogens was examined to develop a strategy to interfere with ligature-induced periodontitis. Animals were parenterally immunized with CEA of either Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia or a combination of CEA/CWA of Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus. Serum samples were taken every 2-4 weeks over a 4-month period, which included a 13-week interval with molar teeth ligated. All of the nonhuman primates in the study exhibited baseline levels of IgG, IgM and IgA antibody to formalinized whole cells of the bacteria. These levels increased significantly following immunization and were elevated above baseline throughout the remainder of the experiment. The largest change in antibody responses was seen in IgA antibody levels of P. gingivalis and C. rectus (42-fold above baseline), IgM antibody to P. intermedia, (41-fold increase) and IgG antibody to F. nucleatum and A. viscosus (32 and 63-fold increases). Moreover, the nonhuman primates exhibited differences in isotype response levels to whole microorganisms compared with the cell envelope antigens. These findings demonstrate the capacity of these nonhuman primates to produce an active immune response to microorganisms chronically colonizing the subgingival microbiota. Additionally, it appears that the bacteria may exhibit some unique differences in their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate and may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - Evidence for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in Macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human IgG subclasses.
AB  - This investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of IgG subclass antibody responses in M. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. The IgG response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. The major IgG subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG3, with little, though significant, responses in the IgG4 and IgG2 subclasses. Seventy-five to 94% of the natural IgG antibody in nonhuman primate sera to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was IgG1. IgG2 and IgG3 predominated to Bacteroides fragilis, IgG4 to Actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact P. gingivalis elicited primarily IgG3 and IgG4, while the post-immunization IgG response to P. intermedia was largely IgG1. Nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from C. rectus and F. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of A. viscosus. The greatest IgG antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive with anti-human IgG1 for all of these antigens except to C. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human IgG2. It appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum IgG subclass antibody responses. The characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - beta-Lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  - In 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. In addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus and Campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (DrySlide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. Isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. Based on the non-selective plates, six of 23 P. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 B. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 F. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. The beta-lactamase positive species Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella buccalis and Actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-Lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range < 0.01-15%). Comparison of the DrySlide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-Lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). It was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a common feature. However, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. The majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found among species of the Prevotella genus.
TI  - Multiple C-terminal serine phosphorylation accompanies both protein kinase C-dependent and -independent activation of cytosolic 85 kDa phospholipase A2 in macrophages.
AB  - Exposure of mouse macrophages to either phorbol ester or certain bacteria was previously shown to cause increased phosphorylation of the cytosolic 85 kDa phospholipase A2 as well as a stable increase in its catalytic activity. We have now attempted to map the major phosphorylation sites on the enzyme in such cells. Phosphorylation occurred on serine residues without a detectable increase in either phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. After CNBr cleavage five fragments showed increased 32P labelling. Among those the most heavily labelled fragment was identified as the most C-terminal (residues 698-749), containing six serine residues. This was true whether phorbol ester or bacteria, causing protein kinase C-independent phospholipase A2 activation, was used as stimulus. The heavy phosphorylation of the most C-terminal fragment and an analysis of tryptic peptides derived from it suggested that more than one of the six serine residues became phosphorylated. Smaller increases also occurred in other CNBr-cleaved fragments from the C-terminal part of the protein, including that carrying Ser-505, a known target of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-2 (extracellular-signal regulated kinase). Dexamethasone treatment (1-100 nM for 20 h), which was earlier shown to dose-dependently down-regulate the 85 kDa phospholipase A2 and its activation by phorbol ester and zymosan, was here shown also to counteract the protein kinase C-independent activation and arachidonate release elicited by bacteria. It remains to be determined whether all phosphorylation sites are equally affected under those conditions.
TI  - The use of a 16s rDNA directed PCR for the detection of endodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The study evaluates a 16S rDNA directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect and differentiate bacteria in necrotic root canal samples. The examination focused on species that are fastidious concerning culture or are difficult to differentiate after culturing by biochemical methods. In the described PCR assay, a universal 16S rDNA directed forward primer in combination with a highly specific reversed one was used to amplify taxon specific gene fragments of 230 to 950 bp length. A similar PCR reaction using a universal 16S rDNA reversed primer was also established to demonstrate bacteria in root canal specimens in general. A first application of this method revealed the presence of Actinomycetales-species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, "Streptococcus milleri," and, presumably for the first time described in infected root canals, Bacteroides forsythus. The identity of amplificons was confirmed by generating sequence information and comparison to gene databanks.
TI  - Host modulation of tissue destruction caused by periodontopathogens: effects on a mixed microbial infection composed of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - These studies determined the ability of selected periodontopathogens to synergistically initiate soft tissue destruction in a murine abscess model. The development of immunity following recovery from infection or by active immunization was also examined. Mice were infected with P. gingivalis W50, F. nucleatum T18, or a combination of the two microorganisms. F. nucleatum caused only a localized lesion in contrast to P. gingivalis which caused a spreading suppurative inflammatory lesion of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, which, depending upon the dose, could result in death. Infection of mice with a combination of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum elicited a significantly greater lesion size (P<0.001) and lethality compared with P. gingivalis alone. Mice infected with a subclinical dose (no visible lesion) of P. gingivalis failed to develop protective immunity to a secondary P. gingivalis challenge. Mice that had recovered from P. gingivalis lesions demonstrated partial protection against subsequent P. gingivalis challenge; however, the immunity was less protective against the mixed F. nucleatum + P. gingivalis infection. Active immunization with P. gingivalis protected against both the P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum + P. gingivalis challenges and this protection was correlated with the levels of specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. The results indicated that the murine model is ideally suited to examine bacterially-mediated mixed infections that result in soft tissue destruction. This destruction can be minimized, but not abrogated, with development of immunity. Challenge with sufficient numbers of the pathogens can overwhelm the acquired immunity.
TI  - The relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with Down's syndrome.
AB  - Gingival inflammation in Down's syndrome children (DS) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-DS children. Abnormalities in host response to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. However, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response to oral microorganisms in DS by age has not been determined. The objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. Sera were obtained from 75 DS subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified PMA Index (M-PMA). Antibody titers to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Selenomonas sputigena (Sel), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Streptococcus mitis (Mi) were determined using the micro-ELISA. DS subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did normal children the same age. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, P < 0.0001) existed in the relationship between M-PMA score and plaque score for subjects in the G1 age group (deciduous dentition). At G1, the average antibody titers to Aa, Mi, and Fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. In addition, IgG antibody titers to Pg, Aa, Fn, Sel, and Mi correlated significantly with the M-PMA scores in the G1 age group. There was a correlation between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. IgG antibody titers to Pg, Aa, Sel, and Mi increased significantly with increasing M-PMA score. Furthermore, the IgG antibody titers to Pg were higher (P < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the DS no-disease group. The IgG antibody titers to Pg at G3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to G1 (preschool children). The IgM antibody titers to Aa at G3 were higher (P < 0.05) when compared to G1. This study suggests that colonization by Aa and Fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in DS patients under 5 years old. Colonization by Pg, Aa, Sel, and Mi in DS appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.
TI  - Occurrence of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth: microbiological findings.
AB  - Bacterial invasion in roots of periodontally diseased teeth, which has been recently documented using cultural and microscopic techniques, may be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence and the species of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth. Samples were taken from the middle layer of radicular dentin of 26 periodontally diseased teeth. 14 healthy teeth were used as controls. Dentin samples were cultured anaerobically. The chosen methodology allowed the determination of the numbers of bacteria present in both deeper and outer part of dentinal tubules, and the bacterial concentration in dentin samples, expressed as colony forming units per mg of tissue (CFU/mg). Invading bacteria was detected in 14 (53.8%) samples from periodontally diseased teeth. The bacterial concentration ranged from 831.84 to 11971.3 CFU/mg (mean+/-standard deviation: 3043.15+/-2763.13). Micro-organisms identified included putative periodontal pathogens such as Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius. These findings suggest that radicular dentin could act as bacterial reservoir from which periodontal pathogens can recolonize treated periodontal pockets, contributing to the failure of therapy and recurrence of disease.
TI  - In vitro activity of Bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, compared to the activities of 11 other oral antimicrobial agents against 390 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from human and animal bite wound skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Bay 12-8039, a new oral 8-methoxyquinolone, was compared to the activities of 11 other oral antimicrobial agents (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin clavulanate, penicillin, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and doxycycline) against 250 aerobic and 140 anaerobic bacteria recently isolated from animal and human bite wound infections. Bay 12-8039 was active against all aerobic isolates, both gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, at < or = 1.0 microg/ml (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90s < or = 0.25 microg/ml) and was active against most anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microg/ml; the exceptions were Fusobacterium nucleatum and other Fusobacterium species (MIC90s, > or = 4.0 microg/ml) and one strain of Prevotella loeschii (MICs, 2.0 microg/ml). In comparison, the other quinolones tested had similar in vitro activities against the aerobic strains but were less active against the anaerobes, including peptostreptococci, Porphyromonas species, and Prevotella species. The fusobacteria were relatively resistant to all the antimicrobial agents tested except penicillin G (one penicillinase-producing strain of F. nucleatum was found) and amoxicillin clavulanate.
TI  - Coaggregation of Candida albicans with oral Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Nine strains of oral Fusobacterium were examined for their ability to coaggregate in vitro with four strains of the oral yeast. Candida albicans. All of the Fusobacterium nucleatum strains and Fusobacterium periodontium and Fusobacterium sulci coaggregated to various degrees with all of the Candida strains. Fusobacterium alocis, Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobactrium simiae strains did not coaggregate with any of the Candida strains. Exposure of the coaggregating Fusobacterium strains but not the Candida strains to heat, trypsin, and proteinase K eliminated coaggregation. Amphotericin B or trichodermin treatment of the yeast species had no effect. The reactions were inhibited by addition of 0.1 M mannose, glucosamine and alpha-methyl mannoside. All coaggregating pairs were disaggregated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but nonionic detergents had no effect. The addition of 2.0 M urea completely reversed coaggregation. Candida strains were sensitive to periodate oxidation, whereas the Fusobacterium strains were stable to this treatment. All coaggregations occurred in the presence of saliva and appeared stronger than in buffer. These data suggest that the coaggregations involve either a protein or glycoprotein on the Fusobacterium surface, which may interact with carbohydrates or carbohydrate-containing molecules on the surface of the Candida. These observations expand the known range of intergeneric coaggregations occurring between human oral microbes and indicate that coaggregation of C. albicans and Fusobacterium species may be an important factor in oral colonization by this yeast. The authors believe this to be the first description of coaggregation concerning a carbohydrate component on the yeast cell and a protein component on the oral bacterial cell.
TI  - Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  - The number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-GABHS tonsillitis. Antibody titres to four Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. An average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in GABHS tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-GABHS tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. There were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both GABHS and non-GABHS groups. These bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Peptostreptococcus spp., F. nucleatum, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp. Significantly higher antibodies levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients with non-GABHS pharyngo-tonsillitis (P < 0.001) and GABHS tonsillitis (P < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. The increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-GABHS and GABHS tonsillitis.
TI  - Uvulitis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: I present two children with bacteremic uvulitis due to anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum was recovered from the blood, and Haemophilus influenzae type b was recovered from a surface uvular culture of one patient. beta-Lactamase-producing Prevotella intermedia was isolated for the blood of the other patient. Both patients responded to parenteral, followed by oral, antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the need to send blood cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in patients with uvulitis.
TI  - Characterization of Bacteroides forsythus isolates.
AB  - Fifteen Bacteroides forsythus strains freshly isolated from patients with periodontitis were used together with three collection strains and one type strain for characterization of growth on various media; determination of enzymatic profiles, antibiotic susceptibility profiles, 16S rRNA ribotypes, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) outer membrane protein profiles, and pathogenicity; and gas chromatography analysis by using a wound chamber model in rabbits. All strains were stimulated by N-acetylmuramic acid, while one strain needed a further supplement such as yeast extract for optimal growth. All strains showed trypsin-like activity. While 10 different ribotypes were found, the SDS-PAGE profiles revealed similar patterns for all strains. All strains were sensitive to penicillin G (MICs, <0.5 microg/ml), ampicillin (MICs, <1.0 microg/ml), amoxicillin (MICs, <0.38 microg/ml), metronidazole (MICs, <0.005 microg/ml), tetracycline (MICs, <0.19 microg/ml), doxycycline (MICs, 0.05 microg/ml), erythromycin (MICs, <0.4 microg/ml), and clindamycin (MICs, <0.016 microg/ml), while they were less sensitive to ciprofloxacin (MICs, <4 microg/ml). B. forsythus did not cause abscess formation by monoinoculation. B. forsythus coinoculated with Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 caused abscess formation in 75% of rabbits, while it caused abscess formation in 100% of rabbits when it was coinoculated with Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC 381. In the case of the latter combination, four of six rabbits died of sepsis after 6 to 7 days, and P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were recovered from the heart blood at a proportion of 10:1. B. forsythus strains were highly virulent and invasive in combination with P. gingivalis.
TI  - Protein degradation by Prevotella intermedia and Actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  - The proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. Bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. Degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. Tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. The number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides, the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large majority of peptidase-producing species. In this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like Prevotella intermedia and Actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing bacteria in mixed cultures. We used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. The breakdown of serum proteins was investigated using capillary electrophoresis. Poor growth was found in mono- and mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum. Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. The presence of P. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. The enhanced growth of P. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. We found that growth of monocultures of Actinomyces meyeri was poor. In contrast, A. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of F. nucleatum and P. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. The growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. Thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. Proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, and P. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, IgG. Our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. This may explain their association with dental abscesses.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic maxillary sinusitis: comparison between specimens obtained by sinus endoscopy and by surgical drainage.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of sinus aspirates obtained during surgery was compared with culture of samples obtained by endoscopy. Six patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were evaluated. Polymicrobial flora was found in all specimens (two-to-five isolates/sample). A total of 24 isolates (18 anaerobic, five aerobic and one micro-aerophilic) was obtained from sinus aspirates, and 25 isolates (16 anaerobic and nine aerobic) were found in endoscopic specimens. The predominant organisms were Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. Concordance in the type and concentration of organisms was found in all cases. Sixteen of the 18 anaerobes isolated from sinus aspirates were also found in the concomitant endoscopic sample. Five aerobic isolates were found in both sinus aspirates and endoscopic samples and their concentration was similar. However, four aerobic gram-positive bacteria (<10(4) cfu/sample) were found only in endoscopy samples. This pilot study demonstrates the usefulness of endoscopic aspiration in the isolation of bacteria from chronically infected maxillary sinuses.
TI  - Periodontal microflora of HIV infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in HIV seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. The subgingival microflora of 20 CDC II, 20 CDC III, 20 CDC IV/V and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. Four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the HIV infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus micros. However, HIV seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloaca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Clostridium difficile, Aspergillus fumigatus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma incognitum. The lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in HIV infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.
TI  - Development of resistance to metronidazole and minocycline in vitro.
AB  - By local delivery of antibiotics to periodontal pockets, very high initial concentrations are often quickly succeeded by subinhibitory concentrations, which may facilitate development of bacterial resistance. The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible development of resistance in suspected periodontal pathogens after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and minocycline. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 18 reference strains and 12 clinical isolates was determined by a broth dilution method. Subsequently, all strains with MIC < 8 micrograms/ml were exposed to serial passage on plates containing subinhibitory and gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotics, until growth was inhibited. Initially, most strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml of minocycline and < or = 0.5 microgram/ml of metronidazole, though A. actinomycetemcomitans was resistant to metronidazole. After growth at subinhibitory concentrations, 8 strains survived 1-2 x and 11 stains survived 8-32 x their initial MIC of metronidazole, growing at up to 8 micrograms/ml. All A. actinomycetemcomitans survived 8-64 x their initial MIC of minocycline, growing at > or = 2 micrograms/ml, while all other strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml, corresponding to a 1-8 x increase in their initial MIC. Thus, development of resistance was observed for periodontal bacteria growing at up to 64 x their initial MIC, but the final level of resistance was moderate.
TI  - Release and activation of human neutrophil matrix metallo- and serine proteinases during phagocytosis of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - The phagocytic ingestion of reference strains and clinical isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and the concomitant release of PMN granule proteinases were studied by specific functional and immunological assays. PMNs were incubated with the microorganisms anaerobically at 37 degrees C for indicated time periods. The suspensions and pellets were used for phagocytic ingestion assay and electron microscopic study, respectively. The supernatants were used for the measurements of the amounts and activities of the released PMN enzymes including PMN gelatinase (MMP-9), collagenase (MMP-8), serine proteases (elastase and cathepsin G), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Both fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and T. denticola were ingested by the PMNs in comparable numbers. However, measurements of the enzymes released from the triggered PMNs revealed major differences among the three species. High amount of elastase was released from the PMNs triggered by F. nucleatum, but not by P. gingivalis or T. denticola. The treatment of PMNs with P. gingivalis whole cells resulted in the release of gelatinase partly in the 82 kD active form, suggesting proteolytic activation of the degranulated 92 kD proMMP-9. The 82 kD active form of gelatinase was not detected upon triggering the PMNs with F. nucleatum and T. denticola. The PMN-bacteria interaction did not result in release of LDH from triggered PMNs indicating the proteinase release was not due to the PMN cell death. The results show that the susceptibilities of the 3 potentially periodontopathogenic microorganisms, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and T. denticola to phagocytic ingestion are not directly related to the amounts and activities of PMN enzymes released during the bacteria-PMN interactions. As PMN degranulation is considered as one of the major pathogenic mechanisms in periodontitis, the observed differences among the microorganisms may be important virulence characteristics of these species.
TI  - Secretion of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. It was recently demonstrated that PMN have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. We therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-8 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) secreted by PMN from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium Escherichia coli. A actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. coli LPS stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 than the control unstimulated PMN (p < 0.01). The levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 released from cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans or E. coli LPS (p < 0.05). On the other hand, substantially greater amounts of IL-1ra were released from PMN stimulated with each LPS and from control unstimulated PMN during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of IL-1ra were secreted by PMN stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans and E.coli LPS during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). The inhibitory effects of IL-1ra on the biological activity of IL-1 in the supernatants of PMN were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. The supernatants of PMN stimulated with each LPS showed less biological IL-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human IL-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of PMN stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS. These findings demonstrated that LPS from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating PMN to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as IL-1ra. Different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various LPS might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Fungi in therapy-resistant apical periodontitis.
AB  - The occurrence of yeasts in 967 microbiological endodontic samples taken from root canals in persistent endodontic infections was studied. The sampling was done by general practitioners in various parts of Finland from root canal infections which did not respond favourably to standard conservative therapy. The samples were cultivated aerobically on a non-selective enriched horse blood agar medium, on TSBV agar medium in 5% CO2 and anaerobically on horse blood agar medium. Micro-organisms were found in 692 of the samples while 275 showed no growth. Forty-eight fungi were isolated from 47 samples which is 7% of the culture-positive samples. Twenty yeast strains were identified further by their colony morphology, growth and cellular characteristics and patterns of carbohydrate assimilation. All isolates except one belonged to the genus Candida. Candida albicans was the most common species. C. glabrata was found together with C. albicans in one sample. C. guilliermondii, C. inconspicua and Geotrichum candidum were each isolated once. Yeasts were found in pure culture in six samples and together with bacteria in 41 samples. In all the samples except two, the accompanying facultative bacteria were Gram positive. The most frequent of them were alpha- and non-haemolytic Streptococcus species which were found in 31 samples. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated together with yeasts from 12 root canals. They included both Gram positive species such as Peptostreptococcus micros and Gram negative species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum. The regular isolation of yeasts, also in pure culture, indicates that yeasts may have an important role in cases of apical periodontitis persisting after conventional treatment.
TI  - Possible lethal enhancement of toxins from putative periodontopathogens by nicotine: implications for periodontal disease.
AB  - AIM: To test the hypothesis that lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and bacterial products (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates) of five putative periodontopathogens. METHODS: The lethality of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates of five periodontal species was assessed with or without nicotine in the chick embryo assay system. Ten putative periodontopathogens (five species) were studied: Prevotella intermedia (n = 5), Porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1), Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (n = 1), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 2), and Fusobacterium necrophorum (n = 1). RESULTS: Simultaneous testing of cell-free extracellular toxins from isolates W50, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (Fisher's Exact test). Simultaneous testing of cell lysates from isolates W50, PS2, and PS5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (Fisher's Exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens (both cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates). This may be an important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontal disease.
TI  - Increase of heat-shock protein and induction of gamma/delta T cells in peritoneal exudate of mice after injection of live Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are Gram-negative rod periodontal pathogens. The peritoneal cavity of Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice was used as the local infection model. In vivo production of heat-shock proteins (hsp) was studied by injection of 1/10 minimum lethal dose (MLD) of each live bacteria into mice. Heat-shock proteins 70 and 60 were examined in the extract of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from mice injected intraperitoneally with either F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans by using sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. Although hsp are present in PEC without injection of the bacteria, both hsp increased and reached a peak on day 3 after F. nucleatum injection but not after A. actinomycetemcomitans. Kinetic study of gamma/delta cells in PEC after injection of bacteria showed that the increase of gamma/delta T cells was observed only in the PEC from mice injected with F. nucleatum but not A. actinomycetemcomitans. The gamma/delta T cells in PEC were either CD3+ and CD4+ or CD3+ and CD8+. The differential cell count of PEC suggested that gamma/delta T-cell induction is related to the expansion of the macrophage population. The phagocytic and chemiluminescence responses of macrophages against the same bacteria were compared after intensive immunization with live F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Elevations of chemiluminescence response and phagocytic function by immunization were observed in the macrophages of mice immunized with F. nucleatum. These results suggest the sequential appearance of hsp, gamma/delta T cells and macrophage activation after fusobacterial infection.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - [Spinal epidural abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum].
AB  - We report a case of spinal epidural abscess. In our knowledge this is the first ever reported case due to Fusobacterium nucleatum. An 83 year old female patient with a history of lumbar trauma presented severe lumbalgia. Magnetic resonance showed the unusual anterior location, complicated by psoas abscess. Laminectomy and lumbar drainage were performed. She was treated with ceftriaxone plus metronidazole during 10 days. The evolution was favourable without any residual neurological morbidity.
TI  - Some properties of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A series of chromatographic techniques was used to purify gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase from Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 23726. The purified enzyme was homogenous with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 101 kD consisting of two different subunits with MW of 67 kD and 31 kD. Its distribution by treatment of lysozyme-EDTA suggested that the enzyme was a periplasmic protein. The pl of the enzyme was 5.9 to 6.2, and the optimum pH of the transpeptidation and the hydrolytic reaction was 8.0. Glycylglycine, glycine and methionine were good acceptors, and the enzyme reaction, in the presence of glycylglycine, was especially efficient. Glutamic acid, glutamine and serine were poor acceptors, and the enzyme activity was inhibited by these amino acids. The apparent Km value for the gamma-glutamyl donor (gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide) was 4.9 x 10(-4)M and that for the acceptor (glycylglycine) was 0.19 M. Affinity-labelling reagents, such as DON, azaserine and AT-125 strongly inhibited the enzyme activity, and its activity was inhibited by L-serine plus borate, as is mammalian gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The antibodies against gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase from bovine kidney reduced the activity of the bacterial enzyme by 65%. These results indicate that the catalytic sites in F. nucleatum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were similar to those in mammalian gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.
TI  - [Microflora of periodontal pockets in advanced periodontitis].
AB  - The aim of study was the evaluation of periodontal pockets microflora in patients with advanced periodontitis. From each subject 16-20 samples were taken using paper points. Pooled sample after 60 s. mixing was serially diluted in reduced BHI. For total cell counts and for the isolation of black pigmented anaerobes Brucella agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood, hemin, menadione, with and without Kanamycin-Vancomycin mixture and BM agar plates were used. For isolation of A. actinomycetemcomitans TSBV agar plates were used. Cultures were incubated in anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees C for 7 days and TSBV agar plates in an atmosphere of 95% air-5% CO2 at 37 degrees C for 5 days. Microorganisms were identified by Gram staining, colony morphology, fluorescence in UV-light, haemagglutination of 3% sheep erythrocytes, fermentation of sugars, production of indole, urease (API 20A), specific enzymes (Rapid ID 32A). Twenty seven subjects with clinically recognized periodontitis were examined. Microorganisms important in periodontitis were isolated from periodontal pockets of almost all examined subjects. The number of bacteria obtained from the sample of one patient ranged from 1 x 10(4) CFU/ml to 3,6 x 10(6) CFU/ml. Porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the samples taken from 17 patients, Prevotella intermedia-19, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans -11, Fusobacterium nucleatum-9, Peptostreptococcus spp.-22.
TI  - Cloning and expression of FomA, the major outer-membrane protein gene from Fusobacterium nucleatum T18.
AB  - The major outer-membrane protein. FomA, of Fusobacterium nucleatum has been associated with porin activity, interbacterial adherence and stimulation of host immune cells. Until now, molecular analysis of FomA has not been possible because previous attempts to clone the fomA gene were not successful. The inability to clone F. nucleatum genes led to speculation that Escherichia coli may not be a suitable host. This report concerns the amplification of the fomA gene of F. nucleatum T18 using oligonucleotide primers containing restriction endonuclease sites that allow cloning of fomA into the E. coli expression vector pMMB67. The resultant plasmid, pXWI, was transformed into E. coli DH5 alpha, providing high-level expression of recombinant FomA (rFomA). Amino acid sequencing of rFomA demonstrated that the FomA signal peptide was correctly processed by E. coli signal peptidase I. rFomA was correctly localized to the outer membrane by the E. coli export pathway. The rFomA protein also displayed the heat-modifiable oligomeric and conformational properties of native FomA (nFomA). This demonstration of rFomA expression, processing, export, and secondary and tertiary structure in E. coli provides support for the feasibility of molecular analysis of the structure and function of FomA and other F. nucleatum proteins using recombinant techniques.
TI  - Evidence for genetic control of changes in f-actin polymerization caused by pathogenic microorganisms: in vitro assessment using gingival fibroblasts from human twins.
AB  - Attachment to and migration upon a substratum, as well as other functions of connective tissue cells, are regulated mainly by cytoplasmic structural proteins, particularly filamentous actin (f-actin). Pathogenic microorganisms exert negative effects on cytoskeletal proteins. In the present study, normal gingival fibroblasts from 10 sets of human twins (6 fraternal, DZ; 4 identical, MZ) were exposed to soluble extracts from Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum, then f-actin was stained using FITC-labeled phalloidin. Cells were examined under fluorescence, and a computer-assisted image analyzer quantitated f-actin polymerization as fluorescence intensity on a per-cell basis. Intraclass correlation coefficients for f-actin in MZ/MZ vis-a-vis DZ/DZ paired cell cultures were determined to assess the possible heritability of responses to the microorganism preparations. F-actin labeling was significantly different between control cultures and those exposed to the extracts. Both F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis effected f-actin and fibroblast morphology. When the data were adjusted for gender and age effects, and for differences in control f-actin levels, fibroblasts from MZ twin pairs were moderately similar in both absolute and relative responses to bacterial challenges; cells from DZ twins showed little similarity when response was measured on the absolute scale, and moderate similarity using the relative scale.
TI  - Microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. The peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (IMZ type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. After grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media. The quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). The mean total cell count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. The following bacteria dominated: species of the family Bacteroidaceae (Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella oralis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella denticola); Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Capnocytophaga spp; and Eikenella corrodens. Bacteroidaceae and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. The increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.
TI  - The clinical, microbial, and host response characteristics of the failing implant.
AB  - The goal of this study was to provide new data regarding levels of inflammatory and growth factor mediators and bacterial pathogens associated with failing implants, as compared to healthy implants. Twenty-one patients with failing implant sites (group 1) and 8 patients with only healthy implants (group 2) were included. Fifteen of the 21 failing implant patients (group 1) also presented with at least one stable nondiseased implant. Plaque samples were examined, using DNA oligonucleotide probes for 40 different microbes. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected for the analyses of catabolic bone resorbing agonists prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6 and anabolic bone-forming growth factors transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Although positive trends were noted, there were no significant differences in any of the microbial, inflammatory, or growth factors mediators comparing failing to stable implants in group 1. This study found greater detection frequencies of P. nigrescens, P. micros, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and F. nucleatum ss nucleatum, as well as significant elevations in GCF levels of PGE2, IL-1 beta, and PDGF in mouths with failing implant sites as compared to mouths with healthy control implants. Risk appears to be primarily at a patient level and secondarily at a site or implant level from a clinical, microbial (P. micros and P. nigrescens), and biochemical (PGE2 and IL-1 beta) perspective. Furthermore, the counts of P. nigrescens and P. micros were found to correlate with concentrations of PGE2 at a site level.
TI  - Short-chain carboxylic acid concentration in human gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - Short-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which can accumulate in the gingival crevice. It is of no small consequence, therefore, that 1- to 5-mM concentrations of these acids exhibit significant biological activity, including the ability to alter cell proliferation and gene expression in cells of importance to the periodontium. This communication reports on the in vivo concentrations of propionic and butyric acid in the gingival crevices of periodontal subjects with severe and mild disease. The results indicated that severely diseased subjects exhibited a > 10-fold increase in the mM concentration of these acids when compared with mildly diseased subjects (mean propionic acid-severe = 9.5 +/- 1.8 mM, and mild = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mM; mean butyric acid-severe = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mM, and mild = 0.2 +/- 0.04 mM). These differences (mean +/- SE) were significant (p < 0.0001). The propionic and butyric acid concentrations were below detection limits in healthy sites of mildly diseased subjects. The propionic and butyric acid concentrations also associated significantly with clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., pocket depth, attachment level) and inflammation (e.g., subgingival temperature, % of sites bleeding when probed), and with the total microbial load (all p < 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that short-chain carboxylic acids play a mediating role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum T18 aggregates human mononuclear cells and inhibits their PHA-stimulated proliferation.
AB  - In previous studies Fusobacterium nucleatum has been shown to induce either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on human mononuclear cells. We examined the interaction of human mononuclear cells with human and cynomolgus monkey strains of F. nucleatum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from normal donors were aggregated in the presence of cells of F. nucleatum but not control bacteria. The aggregation of PBMCs and F. nucleatum T18 was inhibited by either L-arginine, L-lysine, or pretreatment of the bacterial cells with heat, but was unaffected by the presence of sugars or normal human serum. Strain T18 aggregated purified T-cells and monocytes at approximately equal concentrations. When F. nucleatum T18 was incubated with PHA-stimulated PBMCs, DNA synthesis in the PBMCs was significantly inhibited and detection of IL-2R alpha on the PBMCs was reduced. These studies indicate that F. nucleatum aggregates PBMCs, and that this interaction is associated with both an inhibition of PBMC proliferation and a decrease in IL-2 receptor expression. The ability of F. nucleatum to inhibit mononuclear cell proliferation may be significant in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Alveolar bone loss in rats infected with a strain of Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from a child with prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  - Prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum are associated with various forms of periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to infect the clinical isolates of these periodontopathic bacteria and to induce a significant loss of alveolar bone in specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats in the absence of ligatures. P. intermedia YKD8 and F. nucleatum YKZ5 were isolated from a prepubertal periodontitis patient, while P. gingivalis MWB13 was from a patient with juvenile periodontitis. At first, SPF Sprague-Dawley rats (70 days of age, male) were infected with A. viscosus Ny1R and subsequently superinfected with P. gingivalis MWB13, P. intermedia YKD8, or F. nucleatum YKZ5, respectively. The control group was infected with A. viscosus Ny1R alone. All rats were killed and periodontal bone levels were assessed morphometrically 135 days after the first infection with A. viscosus. P. intermedia YKD8 was recovered frequently from rats, with serum antibody levels remaining highly elevated throughout the experiment. Significant loss of alveolar bone was found in rats infected with P. intermedia YKD8, the virulence of which was equivalent to that of P. gingivalis MWB13. F. nucleatum YKZ5 also induced alveolar bone loss, but not significantly when compared with rats infected with A. viscosus Ny1R alone.
TI  - Investigations of the taxonomy and systematics of Fusobacterium nucleatum using allozyme electrophoresis.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum forms part of the resident microbiota in both oral and extraoral sites in humans and animals. It is also involved in infections in such sites. Despite the genetic heterogeneity within the species, it has been divided into five subspecies, the validities of which have been questioned. In the present study, 44 F. nucleatum isolates were examined at 21 enzyme loci by using the allozyme electrophoretic technique to establish an accurate genetic framework for taxonomic purposes. Three distinct genetic clusters were identified; one cluster consisted exclusively of extraoral isolates, another cluster consisted predominantly of human oral isolates, and the third cluster consisted of a single human oral isolate. Our results highlight the urgent need for extensive biochemical, immunological, and epidemiological studies to accurately define the systematics of the genus fusobacterium based on the framework derived in this study by using 21 independent genetic characteristics.
TI  - Disinfection by calcium hydroxide pastes of dentinal tubules infected with two obligate and one facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Bovine dentine cylinders were experimentally infected with Actinomyces israelii,  Fusobacterium nucleatum, or Enterococcus faecalis. The latter is a facultative anaerobic bacteria and the others are obligate anaerobes commonly found in endodontic infections. The infected specimens were exposed to pastes of calcium hydroxide mixed with saline solution or camphorated paramonochlorophenol for periods of 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week. The viability of bacteria after these exposure times was evaluated by specimen incubation in culture medium to compare the effectiveness of the pastes in disinfecting dentinal tubules. The calcium hydroxide/camphorated paramonochlorophenol paste effectively killed bacteria in the tubules after a 1-h period of exposure, except for E. faecalis that required one day of exposure. In contrast, the calcium hydroxide/saline paste was ineffective against E. faecalis and F. nucleatum even after 1 week of exposure. The results showed that camphorated paramonochlorophenol increased the antibacterial effects of calcium hydroxide.
TI  - Rheumatoid factor from periodontitis patients cross-reacts with epitopes on oral  bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the antigenic specificity of rheumatoid factor (RF) that had previously been reported in the serum of patients with periodontitis. DESIGN: IgM-RF was isolated from the serum of five RF-seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients and 14 RF-seropositive periodontitis and examined for specificity to human IgG and selected oral bacteria. METHODS: IgM-RF was prepared by affinity chromatography on human IgG columns. Human IgG antibody to Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated by binding and elution of antibody from the bacteria, followed by purification using a rabbit anti-IgG affinity column. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Binding of the isolated IgM-RF was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antigens used for detection of binding included isolated human IgG, human IgG antibody bound to the bacteria, and the bacteria alone. Inhibition of the IgM-RF binding with IgG or Fc gamma was used to assess the specificity of the reactivity with IgG and/or the bacteria. RESULTS: The results showed that the IgM-RF reacted with polyclonal human IgG nonspecifically bound to microtiter plates. The reactivity of the IgM-RF was increased when incubated with IgG that bound as antibody to C. gingivalis, F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans. However, the IgM-RF did not bind with increased intensity to the specific IgG antibody preparations or to IgG preparations lacking antibody to these micro-organisms. Additionally, the IgM-RF preparations bound to surface components of both C. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. Blocking studies showed that Fc gamma but not IgG inhibited IgM-RF binding to both micro-organisms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the RF detected in the serum of some periodontitis patients may be elicited by certain micro-organisms in the subgingival plaque. Furthermore, C. gingivalis and F. nucleatum appear to express surface antigen epitopes that are antigenically related to determinants on IgG can induce cross-reactive IgM-RF.
TI  - The influence of periodontitis on the subgingival flora around implants in partially edentulous patients.
AB  - The hypothesis that teeth act as reservoirs of micro-organisms for the colonization of oral implants has recently been stated several times. The present study aimed at examining, in partially edentulous patients with severe periodontitis, whether pockets around teeth and implants harbored a comparable micro-flora. In 6 patients (3 with refractory periodontitis and 3 with advanced chronic adult periodontitis), plaque samples were taken from a deep and shallow pocket around both teeth and implants for differential phase contrast microscopy and DNA probe analysis. The results showed important differences in the sub-gingival flora between the 2 disease groups, as well as between deep and shallow pockets, around both implants and teeth. On the other hand, when pockets around teeth and implants with equal depths were compared a striking similarity was observed in the microbial composition. These observations confirm the hypothesis that pockets around teeth act as a reservoir and highlight the importance of periodontal health when oral implants are planned.
TI  - Degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  - The degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. Fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. The degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by Capnocytophaga ochracea, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter sputorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Peptostreptococcus micros. All strains of P. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. The degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin C and albumin. The degradation by C. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. Furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. The present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. The presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.
TI  - Plaque pH and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  - Given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced pH response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. Seventeen caries-active elderly Chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. Plaque pH was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. Plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious pH-measurement sites in each subject. The prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on Brucella agar: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, Streptococcus spp., S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. There was no difference in plaque pH response on sound and carious root surfaces. The plaque pH response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites. There was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. The pH response to sucrose was the same regardless of the presence or absence of mutans streptococci. Our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.
TI  - Immune response to anaerobic bacteria in patients with peritonsillar cellulitis and abscess.
AB  - The role of four oral organisms (Fusobacterium nucleatum. Prevotella intermedia,  Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was investigated in 19 children with peritonsillar abscess, and 17 with peritonsillar cellulitis. Antibody titers to these organisms were measured by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay in the patient, as well as in 32 control patients. Serum levels in the patients were determined at day 1 and 42-56 days later. Significantly higher antibody levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients with peritonsillar cellulitis or abscess, as compared to their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. A total of 136 bacterial isolates, 100 anaerobic and 36 aerobic were isolated from the 19 peritonsillar abscesses. Anaerobic bacteria were found in all abscesses, and they were mixed with aerobic bacteria in 5 (26%). F. nucleatum was recovered in 14 (74%) abscesses and P. intermedia was isolated in 13 (68%). The elevated antibody levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a pathogenic role for these organisms in peritonsillar infections.
TI  - The adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. A possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  - Periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. This study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe by culturing techniques. It also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing Merrit-B probes (with deep indentations) with TPS probes (with smooth surfaces). From the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the Merrit-B probe and 11.3% for the TPS probe). The cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (P < 0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored up to 10(7) CFU. No significant differences could be detected between the probes. When specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all species, even for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. However, the levels of Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (P < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. Differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. Periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. Further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.
TI  - Risk indicators for periodontal disease in a racially diverse urban population.
AB  - A cross-sectional study of 117 subjects from a dental clinic serving a diverse population (i.e., Whites, African-Americans, Native-Americans, and Asians) was performed to evaluate risk indicators of periodontal disease. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival plaque were taken at the same visit from 4 posterior sites of the most diseased sextant in each subject. Age, smoking packyears, beta-glucuronidase (beta G), neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) were significantly (p < 0.05-0.005) correlated with attachment loss. Probing depth was significantly correlated with smoking packyears, beta G, NE, MPO, F. nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia) (p < 0.05-0.005). Mean NE value of Whites was lower than the mean NE values of African-Americans, Native-Americans and Asians (p < 0.05). Whites had a lower mean beta G value compared to African Americans, and a lower mean MPO value compared to African Americans and Native Americans. The %s of patients positive for F. nucleatum, P. intermedia and Eikenella corrodens (E. corrodens) were higher in Native Americans compared to Whites. Step-wise multiple regression analysis was performed to construct models for the estimation of probing depth and attachment loss. The most parsimonious regression models which had the best R2 values included the following variables and accounted for the indicated % of variability: models 1 and 2: beta G, race, and F. nucleatum accounted for 50% of the variability in mean probing depth and 39% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for probing depth, respectively; model 3: age, beta G, and F. nucleatum accounted for 53% of the variability in mean attachment loss; model 4: age, NE, and F. nucleatum explained 35% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for attachment loss. The results suggest that age, race, smoking packyears, beta G, NE, MPO, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia are risk indicators for periodontal disease in this racially diverse urban population. Regression models which include multiple variables (i.e., demographic factors, GCF enzymes and periodontopathic bacteria) can be used to estimate periodontal disease status.
TI  - Cloning of the fomA gene, encoding the major outer membrane porin of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953.
AB  - The major outer membrane protein, FomA, of the Gram-negative human oral pathogen  Fusobacterium nucleatum functions as a porin and is assumed to act as a receptor protein in coaggregation with other oral pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis and Porphyromonas gingivalis. We describe here the cloning of fomA from F. nucleatum in E. coli. Using pGEM3Zf(+), three recombinant plasmids were carrying parts of the fomA gene, but none of these contained regions upstream of the coding sequence. From these plasmids a clone was constructed which contained the whole fomA gene. The ATCC 10953 fomA gene was cloned under the phosphate limitation-inducible phoE promoter, using a vector derived from pACYC184. The protein was found to be incorporated into the outer membrane of the host in an apparently normal manner, as judged by heat-modifiability, trypsin-accessibility, and accessibility to antibodies to the protein in a whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cloned FomA was found to exhibit pore-forming activity.
TI  - Microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. The aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and Moraxella catarrhalis (one). Three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. Failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. These organisms included Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor production.
AB  - To determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (IL-6) and soluble IL-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. Unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure T cells, or monocytes were cultured with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum or Porphyromonas gingivalis for 24 h. Supernatants were tested for IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant IL-6 release in the presence of all bacteria tested. However, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing IL-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or IL-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. No bacteria tested increased soluble IL-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble IL-6 receptor release. We conclude that monocytes release IL-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble IL-6 receptor from T cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate IL-6 actions.
TI  - Electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. The present experiment using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. Soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the root canal and blood. These included Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia. Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis. The electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. Furthermore, with this typing method the species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated. These species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. Also, differences between subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with SDS-PAGE, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. The electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Serum rheumatoid factor induced by intraperitoneal administration of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharide in mice.
AB  - Serum rheumatoid factor (RF) level and peritoneal and splenic CD5+B (B-1) cells in mice were examined after intraperitoneal administration of purified lipopoly-saccharides (LPS) from oral periodontopathic bacteria; Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga ochracea. F. nucleatum and C. ochracea LPS induced higher levels of serum IgM- and IgG-RF, while P. gingivalis LPS showed the least induction. In addition, wet weights of spleen and serum IgM and IgG concentration were markedly increased in F. nucleatum LPS injected group. On the other hand, the proportion of CD5+ B cells to lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity and spleen did not increase. The reason for this was not clear but conventional B cells (CD5- B cells) might increase more rapidly with splenic enlargement than CD5+ B cells. These results suggested that RF induced by bacterial LPS may modulate immune responses against bacteria and plays an important role for defence and destruction of periodontal tissue.
TI  - Strong cytotoxicity to human gingival fibroblasts by Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the cytotoxicity of some bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases. The specificity of cytotoxicity was estimated against cells of various origin and from different individuals. The reference bacteria were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. These bacteria were cultured for 24 h in liquid media and the supernatants were used in cytotoxicity assays. The target cells used were human gingival fibroblasts (GF), dermal fibroblasts (K4), gingival epithelial cells (E) and HeLa-cells (HeLa). These cells were exposed at 4 h or 24 h, respectively, to various concentrations of culture supernatants from the selected bacteria. The influence on the viability and metabolism of the cells were estimated quantitatively as increase in neutral red uptake and lactic acid production. Growth medium supernatants of P. gingivalis 33277 were strongly cytotoxic to gingival fibroblasts after 24 h incubation, compared to supernatants of P. gingivalis 381 or W 50, A. actinomycetemcomitans or F. nucleatum cultures. The toxic effect of P. gingivalis 33277 decreased drastically after heat inactivation, which indicates effects of proteins. By adding anti-sera the cytotoxicity of P. gingivalis 33277 could be dose dependently neutralized, which was not the case when supernatants of A. actino-mycetemcomitans was tested. Target cells of epithelial origin did not show increased cytotoxicity to P. gingivalis 33277. The results of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that P. gingivalis remains as a suspect causative key component in periodontal diseases.
TI  - The influence of abutment surface roughness on plaque accumulation and peri-implant mucositis.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to intra-oral, hard surfaces is firmly influenced by the surface roughness to these structures. Previous studies showed a remarkable higher subgingival bacterial load on rough surfaces when compared to smooth sites. More recently, the additional effect of a further smoothening of intra-oral hard surfaces on clinical and microbiological parameters was examined in a short-term experiment. The results indicated that a reduction in surface roughness below R(a) = 0.2 microns, the so-called "thresholds R(a)", had no further effect on the quantitative/qualitative microbiological adhesion or colonisation, neither supra- nor subgingivally. This study aims to examine the long-term effects of smoothening intra-oral hard transgingival surfaces. In 6 patients expecting an overdenture in the lower jaw, supported by endosseus titanium implants, 2 different abutments (transmucosal part of the implant): a standard machined titanium (R(a) = 0.2 microns) and one highly polished and made of a ceramic material (R(a) = 0.06 microns) were randomly installed. After 3 months of intra-oral exposure, supra- and subgingival plaque samples from both abutments were compared with each other by means of differential phase-contrast microscopy (DPCM). Clinical periodontal parameters (probing depth, gingival recession, bleeding upon probing and Periotest-value) were recorded around each abutment. After 12 months, the supra- and subgingival samples were additionally cultured in aerobic, CO2-enriched and anaerobic conditions. The same clinical parameters as at the 3-month interval were recorded after 12 months. At 3 months, spirochetes and motile organisms were only detected subgingivally around the titanium abutments. After 12 months, however, both abutment-types harboured equal proportions of spirochetes and motile organisms, both supra- and subgingivally. The microbial culturing (month 12) failed to detect large inter-abutment differences. The differences in number of colony- forming units (aerobic and anaerobic) were within one division of a logarithmic scale. The aerobic culture data showed a higher proportion of Gram-negative organisms in the subgingival flora of the rougher abutments. From the group of potentially "pathogenic" bacteria, only Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum were detected for anaerobic culturing and again the inter-abutment differences were negligible. Clinically, the smoothest abutment showed a slightly higher increase in probing depth between months 3 and 12, and more bleeding on probing. The present results confirm the findings of our previous short-term study, indicating that a further reduction of the surface roughness, below a certain "threshold R(a)" (0.2 microns), has no major impact on the supra- and subgingival microbial composition.
TI  - Selling biotechnology in the dental medicine marketplace: the OmniGene Diagnostics DNA probe tests for periodontal pathogens.
AB  - OmniGene Diagnostics, Inc. has applied the principles of genetic engineering to develop species-specific DNA probe tests for eight periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Treponema denticola). The test requires minimal effort on the part of the clinician: subgingival plaque samples are collected from the patient and sent through the mail for analysis by OmniGene Diagnostics' fully licensed clinical reference laboratory. Results are transmitted to the practitioner by phone, fax, or mail. The use of diagnostic tests for periodontal pathogens is a relatively new concept in dentistry and acceptance of the OmniGene Diagnostics tests by the dental marketplace has been slower than anticipated. OmniGene Diagnostics' challenge for the future is to persuade the dental community that monitoring periodontal pathogen levels, as well as other clinical indicators of disease, is essential to providing optimal care to the periodontitis patient.
TI  - Growth inhibition of a human oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis by rat cysteine proteinase inhibitor cystatin S.
AB  - Agar diffusion analysis demonstrated that rat cystatin S, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, inhibited the growth of all tested strains of a human oral, Gram-negative anaerobic periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. Its specific inhibitory activity against this tissue-invasive bacterium but not against other tested oral bacterial species emphasized the importance of specific cysteine proteinases for growth of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  - Infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA,  and Candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. We enumerated MRSA and C. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. Staphylococcus species, MRSA, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSE, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. C. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. All saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried Staphylococcus species and C. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. Adherence of isolated 3H labeled cells of MRSA and C. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. Cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. The hydrophobicity of the MRSA isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of C. albicans strains was moderately high. The zeta potentials of MRSA isolates and of C. albicans isolates determined in KCI buffer were significantly low. The potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. Two out of 5 MRSA strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of Staphylococcus species. No isolates of C. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the oral bacteria tested. Isolates of MRSA and C. albicans coaggregated with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum strains. Using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of Staphylococcus species or C. albicans organisms in saliva.
TI  - The effect of areca nut on salivary and selected oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. The antibacterial properties of the above were tested on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, Staphylococcus aureus. This was followed by investigating its effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca nut. Extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw nut. Growth of C. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. Tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. No antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. It is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.
TI  - Acute tongue abscess: report of two cases.
AB  - Tongue abscesses are extremely rare. Two cases caused by periodontal pathogens are presented.
TI  - The relationship of gingival crevicular fluid short chain carboxylic acid concentration to gingival inflammation.
AB  - Short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCA; C < or = 5; e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which accumulate in the gingival crevice, and exhibit significant biological activity, including the ability to alter gene expression. It has been hypothesized that among the activities of SCCAs are their ability to contribute to gingival inflammation. This concept complements the notion that specific periodontal pathogens are the causative agents of gingival inflammation. To begin testing these 2 hypotheses, we examined the relationship between SCCA concentrations, specific putative periodontal pathogens, and gingival inflammation in medically healthy periodontally diseased subjects. We reasoned that if SCCAs and/or specific periodontal pathogens were causative gingival inflammatory agents, gingival inflammation should increase with increasing concentration of the inflammatory mediator. We also recognized that other clinical variables needed to be controlled for, and an objective quantitative assessment of gingival inflammation used. To accomplish these tasks, sites within subjects were stratified by location and pocket depth, and the following quantified: bacterial presence; SCCA concentration; and gingival inflammation. The results indicated that gingival inflammation directly and significantly correlated with SCCA concentrations in the maxillary and mandibular molars, incisors and canines (all r > or = 0.47; all p < or = 0.015; too few bicuspids were available for complete analysis). The relationship between gingival inflammation and SCCA concentration was best described by a natural log relationship. Gingival inflammation did not, however, correlate positively with either the total number of specific putative periodontal pathogens, or the sum of subsets of these pathogens (-0.31 < or = r < or = 0.39; 0.08 < or = p < or = 0.75) for any of the locations. Finally, the SCCA concentration did not correlate with the level of individual or groups of pathogens. These data, together with historical work and other preliminary data, support the hypothesis that SCCA, rather than specific putative periodontal pathogens, may be a causative agent in gingival inflammation. This work may, in part, begin to explain the apparent lack of a direct relationship between current gingival inflammation and the prediction of bacterially mediated periodontal attachment loss.
TI  - Evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of locally-applied minocycline in adult periodontitis patients.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to establish in a long-term investigation the safety as well as the clinical and microbiological efficacy of scaling and rootplaning combined with local application of 2% minocycline hydrochloride-gel versus placebo-gel in patients with moderate to severe chronic adult periodontitis. This was an 18 months, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative study, in which 20 healthy patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis participated. At baseline, all patients received professional oral hygiene-instruction and supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing. The minocycline-gel was applied subgingivally baseline, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Microbiological evaluation was carried out using DMDx to identify the following bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola. In addition standard microbiological techniques were used for the detection of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. micros, A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, C. albicans and Enterobacteriaceae. Results showed a statistically significant improvement for all clinical parameters irrespective of the treatment modality. No differences were observed between test and control with regard to probing depth and attachment level. The DMDx data showed a significant reduction in both the numbers and the prevalence over the 15 months period, but no significant difference between groups. Culture data showed that at baseline two-third were positive for P. gingivalis and P. intermedia. Analysis over the 18 month period showed no significant difference between the two treatment modalities. C. albicans and Enterobacteriaceae were detected only in small proportions at each time interval in a limited number of patients. No adverse reactions were observed during the trial period. The present patient group responded favourably to scaling and rootplaning, but did not benefit from an effect of local of minocycline. Subgingival debridement in combination with oral hygiene instruction by itself has been shown to be effective. It remains to be studied whether local application of minocycline can be effective as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in sites that respond poorly to conventional treatment.
TI  - The effect of chlorhexidine on defined, mixed culture oral biofilms grown in a novel model system.
AB  - In order to develop an improved method to evaluate antimicrobial agents for use in clinical dentistry, a constant-depth film fermenter (CDFF) has been used to generate biofilms of fixed depth comprising nine species of bacteria commonly found in dental plaque in health and disease. These bacteria were grown together initially in a conventional chemostat which was used to inoculate the CDFF over an 8 h period. Medium was then supplied directly to the CDFF and biofilms allowed to develop. The biofilms were then challenged with eight short pulses of two concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.0125 and 0.125% w/v). The lower concentration had a limited effect on the composition of the biofilms while a differential and substantial inhibition was obtained with a higher concentration. Actinomyces naeslundii was lost from the biofilm, and the viable counts of streptococci, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were inhibited by over three orders of magnitude by 0.125% chlorhexidine, whereas Veillonella dispar was only transiently affected. The findings were consistent with those from clinical studies of dental plaque, suggesting that this model would have a predictive value when evaluating novel antiplaque or antimicrobial inhibitors.
TI  - An in vitro study of the coronal leakage of two root canal sealers using an obligate anaerobe microbial marker.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the coronal leakage of obligate anaerobes into root canals obturated with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha with two root canal sealers. Sixty extracted human teeth with straight, single root canals were prepared using the modified double-flared technique with balanced force under copious irrigation until the master apical file was size 40. The teeth were divided randomly into experimental groups (40 teeth) and control groups (20 teeth). In the experimental groups, 20 teeth were obturated with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha and AH26 sealer and 20 teeth were obturated with the same technique using TubliSeal EWT sealer. In the control groups, 10 teeth were obturated with the same technique either with AH26 or TubliSeal EWT sealer. These teeth were completely sealed to serve as negative controls. The remaining 10 teeth were not obturated and served as positive controls. The root surface of each tooth was sealed with nail varnish except the apical 2 mm. The coronal part of each root canal was sealed with the cut end of polypropylene tube and placed in a glass bottle containing sterile Fastidious Anaerobe Broth (FAB). Aliquots of 0.5 mL of FAB were injected into the polypropylene tube and the model system was centrifuged at 168 g. An inoculum of Fusobacterium nucleatum in FAB was placed in each coronal chamber at 7-day intervals and daily observations were made for bacterial growth in the apical reservoir for 12 weeks. All positive control teeth showed bacterial leakage within a week, while the negative control teeth remained uncontaminated throughout the test period. All the experimental teeth exhibited leakage of bacterial metabolites within 12 weeks, ranging from 1 to 12 weeks. The mean time for complete leakage in the AH26 and the TubliSeal EWT groups was 8.4 and 8.2 weeks respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) in leakage between the AH26 and the TubliSeal EWT groups.
TI  - The establishment of a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of Candida albicans in a chemostat.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of Candida albicans in the chemostat. The chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. After a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with C. albicans to establish the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. The steady-state community comprised the species Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Lactobacillus casei, Eubacterium saburreum, Veillonella dispar and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Bacteroides gracilus and Haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. Yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. It is concluded that this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and C. albicans in the oral cavity.
TI  - Induction of systemic murine B-cell responses by Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the antigenic abilities of Fusobacterium nucleatum strain ATCC 25586 and Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W50 black inbred BALB/cABom mice immunized subcutaneously. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze whether the outer membranes (OM) and whole cells (WC) of F. nucleatum or P. gingivalis had an effect on the levels of antibody response and whether a combination of both could either enhance or suppress the B-cell response. A single-cell assay, solid-phase enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), was used to analyze the splenic B-cell response (immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG and IgM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting were used to verify the specific antibody response in the sera. A statistically significant lower level of spontaneous antibody production was observed in the group immunized with P. gingivalis OM compared with groups immunized with F. nucleatum and saline. The specific antibody titers measured by ELISA indicated that the bacterial preparations were able to induce IgG and IgM response. The preparations containing P. gingivalis OM induced higher humoral response than the preparations containing P. gingivalis WC, but for F. nucleatum such a difference was not observed. The prominent proteins revealed had apparent molecular masses of 40 kDa for F. nucleatum and 115, 55-56 and 43 kDa for P. gingivalis; whereas the immunoreactive proteins were 70, 65 and 40 kDa for mice immunized with F. nucleatum and 115, 55-56, 43 and 33-34 kDa for mice immunized with P. gingivalis. Quantitative analysis of B-cell response at the single cell level with ELISPOT revealed that some component(s) of P. gingivalis OM may have a suppressive ability on splenocytes incubated for a short time.
TI  - A scanning electron microscopic evaluation of in vitro dentinal tubules penetration by selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro root canal dentinal tubule invasion by selected anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated from endodontic infections was evaluated. Dentinal cylinders obtained from bovine incisors were inoculated with bacteria, and microbial penetration into tubules was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that all bacterial strains tested were able to penetrate into dentinal tubules, but to different extents.
TI  - Microbiology of periapical abscesses and associated maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirate of pus from 5 periapical abscesses of the upper jaw and their corresponding maxillary sinusitis were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Polymicrobial flora were found in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5. Anaerobes were recovered from all specimens. The predominant isolates were Prevotella sp., Porphyromonas sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus sp. Concordance in the microbiological findings between periapical abscess and the maxillary sinus flora was found in all instances. However, certain organisms were only present at one site and not the other. Five beta-lactamase-producing organisms were present in the five specimens. These data confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in periapical abscesses and demonstrate their predominance in maxillary sinusitis that is associated with them.
TI  - Treatment of periodontal disease based on microbiological diagnosis. Relation between microbiological and clinical parameters during 5 years.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effect of treatment aimed to suppress Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis below detection level and Prevotella intermedia below 5% of the cultivable periodontal pocket flora. Sixteen patients and a total of 111 periodontal pockets with probing depth > or = 6 mm were included in the study. Twelve patients and a total of 77 sites completed the 5-year study. The results demonstrated clinical improvement of probing depth and gain of clinical attachment level of 3.4 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. Treatment to eliminate indicator bacteria continued for 3 years before the aim was fulfilled. In order to eliminate A. actinomycetemcomitans from a majority of the sites, a combination of surgery and generalized tetracycline treatment was performed. A recolonization or regrowth of the indicator bacteria exceeding detection levels took place in several sites. The presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. P. gingivalis, and P. intermedia, alone or in combination, correlated with attachment level change on the individual level. No such correlation was obtained by using presence of plaque, bleeding on probing, or three other bacteria (Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) not used as treatment goal markers.
TI  - scbA from Streptococcus crista CC5A: an atypical member of the lraI gene family.
AB  - A new member of the lraI family of putative adhesin genes was cloned, from Streptococcus crista CC5A, and sequenced. The gene, scbA appears to be part of an ABC transport operon and encodes a putative peptide of 34.7 kDa. The protein contains a signal sequence with residues 17 to 21 (L-A-A-C-S) matching the consensus sequence for the prolipoprotein cleavage site of signal peptidase II. ScbA is 57 to 93% identical, at the amino acid level, with the five previous sequenced members of the LraI family. Surprisingly, ScbA does not exhibit adhesion properties characteristic of the other LraI proteins. Strain CC5A bound poorly to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and did not coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii PK606. An scbA insertion-duplication mutation that abolished expression (of ScbA was created. There was no difference in fibrin binding between this mutant and wild-type CC5A. Since it is possible that ScbA could play a role in corncob formation between S. crista and Fusobacterium nucleatum, this property was examined. The mutant strain retained the ability to form corncobs. On the basis of the lack of adhesin properties it appears that ScbA is an atypical member of the LraI family.
TI  - Mixed infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in a murine lesion model: potential synergistic effects on virulence.
AB  - These studies determined the characteristics of tissue destruction in a murine abscess model elicited by mixed infection with the periodontopathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The interbacterial effects of this synergism, the kinetics of the relationship of the bacterial interaction, and the characteristics of the bacteria required for the tissue destruction were studied. Infection of mice with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum strains elicited lesions of various sizes as a function of infective dose. Primary infection with F. nucleatum plus P. gingivalis at various ratios (i.e., <1:1) resulted in a significantly greater lesion size (P < 0.001) compared with that resulting from primary infection with P. gingivalis alone. At F. nucleatum/P. gingivalis ratios of > or = 1:1, spreading lesion formation and progression were significantly (P < 0.001) decreased, suggesting that bacterial interaction (i.e., coaggregation) may have inhibited the spread of the P. gingivalis infection to a site distant from the initial injection. Infection with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis simultaneously (at different sites) or F. nucleatum administered within 4 h prior to or 1 h following P. gingivalis infection significantly enhanced the ability of P. gingivalis to form large phlegmonous lesions. Chemical inhibition of the P. gingivalis trypsin-like protease activity or the use of a trypsin-negative P. gingivalis strain abrogated tissue destruction either alone or in combination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, it was possible to examine aspects of virulence of these pathogens in a murine lesion model by either altering bacterial ratios, manipulating the time of infection, or targeting vital bacterial virulence factors.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  - Funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed Gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to S-HA. Colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. The colonization of Streptococcus cricetus E49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. The mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. The inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. Funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to S-HA and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (Co-HA) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast Gin-1 cell line. The present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.
TI  - Effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  - Although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. Studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic, Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, NJ) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. These studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria. These in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.
TI  - The interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. The reference bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (GF) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (E) from 2 such persons, HeLa cells (HeLa), and an amnion cell line (Amnion). The cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a Bioscreen robot analyzer (Labsystems, Finland). Results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Anaerobic microorganisms in root canals of human teeth with chronic apical periodontitis detected by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  - Aiming to assess the presence of selected anaerobic microorganisms in root canals of human teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. 25 central and lateral upper incisors presenting with radiographic evidence of chronic apical periodontitis were studied. The pulp chamber was opened under aseptic conditions and samples of the root canal content were collected with sterile absorbent paper points, which were placed and dispersed in test tubes containing reduced transport medium RTT. Aliquots were dried on glass slides and stained by indirect immunofluorescence for detection of Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The results showed a positive indirect immunofluorescence reaction in 24 of the 25 samples. Fourteen were positive for the specie Actinomyces viscosus, 12 for Prevotella intermedia, 10 for Fusobacterium nucleatum and 4 for Porphyromonas gingivalis. A semiquantitative assay was easily implemented for assessment of degree of infection by the organisms in individual cases.
TI  - Proteolytic artifacts in SDS-PAGE analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (Fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. Conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. Bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (SDS+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. A control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. Cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie blue. Proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of P. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in P. nigrescens and T. denticola. No proteolysis was observed for F. nucleatum. In all cases, heat (100 degrees C) and low pH (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production of proteolytic artifacts. Incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. More particularly, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mM) were highly efficient for P. gingivalis, P. nigrescens and T. denticola, respectively. When outer membranes of P. gingivalis were prepared in the presence of TLCK, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of TLCK, were detected. The present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.
TI  - Degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - Bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. In the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. The activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. Proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin III, antiplasmin and cystatin C) was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The 80 kDa trypsin-like protease of P. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kDa chymotrypsin-like protease of T. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin C. When whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Capnocytophaga spp. Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, had no effect on the protease inhibitors. The 80 kDa protease of P. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kDa protease of T. denticola. This study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. This may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.
TI  - The effect of age on the development of gingivitis. Clinical, microbiological and histological findings.
AB  - In the present "experimental gingivitis" study, the response of the marginal gingiva to plaque formation was studied in one group of young subjects, 20-25 years of age, and in one group of older subjects, aged 65-80 years. During a 4-week period, all subjects received a series of professional tooth cleaning to establish healthy gingival conditions. A baseline examination (Day 0) included assessments of plaque and gingivitis. Sites that were examined (the experimental sites) included the mesio-palatal, palatal, and disto-palatal surfaces of all teeth present in the 15 ... 25 tooth region. Among the experimental sites, microbial sampling and gingival fluid assessment were performed and one gingival biopsy harvested from each subject. Following the baseline examination, the participants abolished mechanical tooth cleaning measures in the palatal and approximal surfaces of 15 ... 25. The clinical examination and the gingival fluid measurement were repeated on days 7, 14 and 21 of no oral hygiene. The microbiological sampling and the biopsy procedure were repeated on days 7 and 21. The data collected demonstrated that old subjects, during a 3-week period of oral hygiene abstention, formed similar amounts of plaque as the young subjects, but developed more gingivitis than young subjects. Thus, the clinical gingivitis assessments, the gingival fluid measurements and morphometric determinations made in the biopsy samples documented that the gingival lesion which formed in the old individuals was more pronounced and contained more inflammatory cells than the corresponding lesion in the young subject sample.
TI  - Response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and B. forsythus.
AB  - In a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or Augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either Ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. Since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified Widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: Augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. Treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for their content of 14 subgingival species including P. gingivalis, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia and B. forsythus using DNA probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species group. Because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. However, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. Low test species subjects receiving Augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. The mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. High test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving Augmentin (14.1). Periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with Augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. The greatest proportion of gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. Overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in C. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens. The 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. In contrast, Augmentin appeared to be effective in decreasing the % sites colonized by A. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by C. ochracea. Knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for periodontal therapy.
TI  - Histological and microbiological aspects of ligature-induced periodontitis in beagle dogs.
AB  - This study was designed to investigate, using 6 beagle dogs, the levels of selected putative pathogens in healthy sites, in gingivitis sites, and in sites with histologically confirmed attachment loss. Levels of attachment loss increased with increasing periods of ligation and reached a maximum of 0.15 mm at 57 days. Both histological attachment level and histological pocket depth were found to vary significantly with health/disease status (p < 0.0001). Higher numbers of total colony-forming units were seen for ligated sites than for healthy and gingivitis sites. Levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia also changed significantly with health/disease status (p < 0.001). These organisms showed their greatest increases at the time of the most intense attachment loss. Higher levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum were seen in the gingivitis sites than in healthy or ligated sites. Low levels of Campylobacter rectus and Capnocytophaga spp. were detected throughout. The morphometric microbiological analysis revealed unexpectedly high %s of motile rods, while spirochetes were found in very low %s. The total number of bacterial cells detected using phase contrast microscopy was not found to vary significantly. None of the morphotypes were demonstrated as showing significant changes with health/disease status.
TI  - Host defensive functions in a family manifesting early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - Family case studies help us identify host risk factors in periodontal disease. In this study we examine a family consisting of a mother (40 years old, with rapidly progressive periodontitis), her elder daughter (14 years old, with localized juvenile periodontitis), and younger daughter (13 years old, with simple gingivitis). We examined 1) the peripheral neutrophil functions (chemotactic migration, phagocytosis, superoxide production); 2) lymphocyte functions (proliferative activity and cytokine productivity of T cells, immunoglobulin [Ig] M productivity of B cells when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen); 3) phenotypic analyses of peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations; 4) serum IgG antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria; and 5) serological type of HLA class II. All the subjects exhibited high T4/T8 ratios due to high percentage of CD4-positive cells, showed high IgG titers to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and had a HLA DQw1 in common. The mother showed a slight deficiency of neutrophil chemotactic migration to N-formyl methyonyl leucyl phenylalanin (fMLP), raised interleukin-2 productivity of T cell, and high levels of IgG titers to Porphyromonus gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Both daughters showed weak T cell proliferative response to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and low IgM productivity. Low lymphocyte responsiveness may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease of these daughters; therefore, the lymphocyte dysfunctions shown should be considered in relation to the progression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Incidence of anaerobes in ventilator-associated pneumonia with use of a protected specimen brush.
AB  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been  little investigated. In this study we analyzed the incidence of anaerobes in patients with a first episode of bacteriologically documented VAP (> 10(3)CFU/ml), using protected specimen brushes (PSB). We particularly took care to preserve anaerobic conditions during transport and the microbiological procedure. Two groups were considered: group A with anaerobic bacteria recovered from PSB, with or without anaerobes, and group B with aerobic bacteria only. One hundred and thirty patients were included, 30 (23%) in group A, and 100 (77%) in group B. The main anaerobic strains isolated were Prevotella melaninogenica (36%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), and Veillonella parvula (12%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients in group A were younger than those in group B (p < 0.05) and their simplified acute physiologic score was higher (p < 0.02). The percentage of patients receiving antibiotics before PSB did not differ significantly between group A (57%) and group B (35%). VAP with anaerobes occurred more often in patients orotracheally intubated than nasotracheally intubated (p < 0.02). Episodes of VAP involving anaerobic bacteria occurred more often in the first five days (early VAP) than after the fifth day (late VAP) (p < 0.05). The 3-mo mortality rate was similar in the two groups, but death occurred earlier in group B (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that presence of altered level of consciousness (p = 0.0002), higher simplified acute physiologic score (p = 0.003), and admission to the medical ICU (p = 0.02) were the factors independently predisposing to the development of VAP with anaerobes.
TI  - Identification and analysis of fipA, a Fusobacterium nucleatum immunosuppressive  factor gene.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that sonic extracts of Fusobacterium nucleatum FDC 364 were capable of inhibiting human T-cell responses to mitogens and antigens. The purified F. nucleatum immunosuppressive protein (FIP) is composed of two subunits of 44 and 48 kDa. Furthermore, FIP inhibits T-cell activation by arresting cells in the middle of the G(1) phase of the cell cycle; the data available to date suggest that FIP impairs the expression of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen. To initiate delineation of FIP structure-function relationships, molecular cloning of the FIP gene was carried out. A DNA library of F. nucleatum FDC 364 was constructed by partial digestion of genomic DNA with Sau3A and screened for the production of FIP with polyclonal antibody. Twelve immunoreactive clones were identified. One of these clones contained a 3.1-kbp insert and was chosen for further study. Cell lysates were found to contain an immunoreactive band that comigrated with the 44-kDa subcomponent of the native FIP. Sequencing of the 3.1-kpb insert revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF extends from nucleotides 415 to 1620, encodes 402 amino acids, and is preceded by a ribosome-binding site. Deletion analysis and antibody elution analysis showed that this ORF encodes the 44-kDa subunit (FipA) of native FIP. A second ORF is situated upstream of fipA. However, Northern (RNA) analysis suggested that fipA is not transcribed as part of an operon but transcribed from its own promotor. Finally, the partially purified recombinant FipA protein was capable of impairing T-cell activation in a manner consistent with the native protein. These results indicate that the two components that form the native protein are most probably distinct gene products and suggest that the 44-kDa FipA polypeptide is sufficient to mediate the immunosuppressive activities of the native protein complex.
TI  - Associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  - Significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. The prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. Seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella oralis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia. Significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella melaninogenica, Pstr. micros/Prev. melaninogenica (all P < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and Pstr. micros/Prevotella spp. (P < 0.01); (c) 'Wet' canal (57 cases) and Prevotella spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.01), Peptostreptococcus spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.05). Thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific bacteria.
TI  - Development of a steady-state oral microbial biofilm community using the constant-depth film fermenter.
AB  - The complexity of biofilm communities like dental plaque suggests that laboratory model biofilm growth systems may help to understand their structure and function. This study describes the use of a constant-depth film fermenter (CDFF) to investigate biofilm formation by a nine-membered community of oral bacteria. The community was grown to steady state in a chemostat incubated anaerobically. The chemostat output was fed into the CDFF incubated aerobically. Viable counts for each species from the chemostat and the CDFF at steady state showed major differences; however, all nine organisms were present under both conditions. There was evidence of succession during biofilm formation with obligately anaerobic species only establishing after several days. A steady-state biofilm community was achieved which remained stable over time. Electron microscopy showed evidence of spatial differentiation with what appeared to be Neisseria subflava dominant near the upper surface and Fusobacterium nucleatum largely confined to the middle portion.
TI  - Effect of oxygen, inoculum composition and flow rate on development of mixed-culture oral biofilms.
AB  - The effect of aeration on the development of a defined biofilm consortium of oral bacteria was investigated in a two-stage chemostat system. An inoculum comprising 10 species, including both facultatively anaerobic and obligately anaerobic bacteria, and species associated with oral health and disease, was inoculated into an anaerobic first-stage chemostat vessel. The effluent from this chemostat was linked to an aerated [200 ml CO2/air (5:95, v/v) min-1] second-stage vessel, in which removable hydroxyapatite discs were inserted to allow biofilm formation. Comparisons were made of planktonic and biofilm communities in the aerated second-stage vessel by means of viable counts. Both planktonic and early biofilm communities were dominated by Neisseria subflava, comprising > 40% of total c.f.u. in the fluid phase, and > 80% of c.f.u. in 2 h biofilms. Obligate anaerobes persisted in this mixed culture, and succession in biofilms led them to predominate only after 7 d. Despite the continuous addition of air, the dissolved oxygen tension (dO2) within the culture remained low (< 5% of air saturation), and the redox potential (Eh) was -275 mV. In order to assess the significance of the presence of N. subflava in community development, a subsequent experiment omitted this aerobe from the inoculum, to produce a nine-species culture. The planktonic phase was predominated by three streptococcal species, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Biofilms again underwent successional changes, with anaerobes increasing in proportion with time. In contrast to the culture including N. subflava, dO2 was 50-60% of air saturation, and the Eh was +50 mV. In the final experiment, the rate of addition of first-stage culture was reduced to 1/10 of that in the previous experiment, in order to determine whether anaerobes were growing, rather than merely persisting in the aerated culture. The data for the planktonic phase indicated that the anaerobes were growing in aerated (dO2 40-50%, Eh +100 mV) conditions. Once again, anaerobes increased in proportion in older biofilms. The study indicates that mixed cultures can protect obligate anaerobes from the toxic effects of oxygen, both in the biofilm and planktonic modes of growth.
TI  - Isolation of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria from feline subcutaneous abscesses.
AB  - A total of 113 specimens collected from purulent skin lesions of household cats was examined bacteriologically. Ninety seven isolates obtained from 74 specimens (65.5%). Of these, 11 specimens (9.7%) contained obligate anaerobes only, 18 specimens (15.9%) yielded both obligate and facultative anaerobes. In the obligate anaerobes detected, genus Fusobacterium was the most frequently observed and F. nucleatum was most common species. Pasteurella multocida was the facultative anaerobe which was most frequently detected.
TI  - Microbiological and serological investigations of oral lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - Microbiological and serological (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) investigations were carried out, including karyotyping, on two Asian children with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. In case 1, a girl aged four years, the most prevalent putative periodontopathogens were Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia (deciduous dentition) and Bacteroides gracilis, E corrodens and F nucleatum (permanent dentition). In case 2, a boy aged nine years, they were F nucleatum, P intermedia and P loeschii and E corrodens. Serum from case 2 showed a raised specific IgG antibody response to Actinomyces actino-mycetemcomitans serotype b. Thus, a wider range of species than hitherto reported may be associated with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, including A actino-mycetemcomitans and F nucleatum.
TI  - Prevalence of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from Romanian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, and Capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form Romanian adult periodontitis patients. DNA probe analysis (Affirm DP Microbial Identification Test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. Paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. The chi 2 test was used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and DNA analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. P. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. Capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. Enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. Except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the West. The Affirm DP Test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus. The cultivation prevalence of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. Overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present Romanian periodontitis patients is similar to what has been revealed in matching Norwegian and other Western periodontitis patient populations. The high prevalence of enteric rods in the Romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in VMGA III.
TI  - Rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  - Eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate tests. Identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. Characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five Porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting Prevotella species, Bacteroides forsythus, three Capnocytophaga species, six Actinomyces species, four Propionibacterium species, and eight Streptococcus species. Two mannoside isomers differentiated Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae. In addition to Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus, and Capnocytophaga species, Fusobacterium alocis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces meyeri, and Bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. Fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. The method was ideal for rapidly obtaining presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as SDS-PAGE.
TI  - Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in patients  with infectious mononucleosis.
AB  - The role of four oral flora organisms (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was investigated in 22 patients with infectious mononucleosis. Immunoglobulin-G class antibody titres to these organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels in the patients were determined at day 1 and 42-56 days later. Significantly higher antibody levels to F. nucleatum and Pr. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients as compared to their first sample. The elevated antibody levels to F. nucleatum and Pr. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in the pharyngo-tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis.
TI  - The use of allozyme electrophoresis to assess genetic heterogeneity among previously subspeciated isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Five subspecies have previously been proposed. The validity of these subdivisions was investigated using allozyme electrophoresis for 21 enzyme mobilities. The 18 F. nucleatum isolates tested had previously been subspeciated and included type strains as well as isolates from both oral and extraoral sites. The results showed 2 distinct genetic groups with fixed differences at 82.5% of the test loci, indicative of a species complex with a number of subspecies within each of the 2 groups. There was also evidence of a correlation between the 2 major groups of isolates and the site from which they were taken. It was concluded that there is a high degree of genetic heterogeneity within the species F. nucleatum and that its current subspeciation is of questionable validity.
TI  - A microbiological and clinical study of the safety and efficacy of baking-soda dentifrices.
AB  - This article reports the results of a study that examined the clinical and microbiological changes associated with regular use of baking-soda dentifrices. Two dentifrice formulations were examined in a 6-month longitudinal study of 101 adult subjects with assessments for plaque, gingival inflammation, and stain at baseline and 3 and 6 months during the active phase of the study, and at 3 months after cessation of product use. One dentifrice contained 52% baking soda and 3% sodium percarbonate (Arm & Hammer PeroxiCare) while the other dentifrice contained 65% baking soda (Arm & Hammer Dental Care). Both dentifrices resulted in statistically significant reductions in dental plaque, gingival inflammation, and stain at all time periods compared to baseline. Dental plaque and buccal soft-tissue samples were obtained for microbiological analysis from a 50-subject subset. Microbiological assays, including bacterial culture, phase-contrast microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy, confirmed the safety of both formulations. Beneficial alterations in dental plaque bacteria were noted, including significant reductions in the levels of Actinomyces species. The data from this study indicate that dentifrices containing high levels of baking soda are clinically effective and microbiologically safe.
TI  - Extraction and characterization of the smooth-type lipopolysaccharide from Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM 8532 and its biological activities.
AB  - The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM 8532 was isolated by  hot-phenol water extraction. Most of the LPS was extracted in the phenolic phase and shown to be the smooth-type, whereas the aqueous phase contained mainly rough-type LPS. The chemical composition of the LPS was similar to that reported in other studies, but D-quinovosamine, which may be a major component of O-antigenic polysaccharide, and 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdoi) were detected for the first time by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The biological activities of smooth-type LPS, including limulus activity, lethal toxicity, pyrogenicity, and B lymphocyte mitogenicity, were comparable to those of entero-bacterial LPS. Smooth-type LPS inhibited the cell growth and DNA synthesis of adult and fetal human gingival fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that LPS may play a role in the occurrence of human gingivitis.
TI  - Recurrent vertebral osteomyelitis and psoas abscess caused by Streptococcus constellatus and Fusobacterium nucleatum in a patient with atrial septal defect and an occult dental infection.
AB  - We describe a case in which recurrent vertebral osteomyelitis and psoas abscess due to Streptococcus constellatus and Fusobacterium nucleatum developed in a patient with a previously unrecognized atrial septal defect with bidirectional shunts. Disease recurrence was ascribed to the presence of dental disease, which served as the source of infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which vertebral osteomyelitis and psoas abscess have been associated with atrial septal defect.
TI  - Comparison of spiral gradient endpoint and agar dilution methods for susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria: a multilaboratory collaborative evaluation.
AB  - A multilaboratory collaborative study was carried out to assess the utility of the spiral gradient endpoint (SGE) method for the determination of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobes and to evaluate the equivalence of the MICs obtained by the SGE method with those obtained by the reference agar dilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The standard deviation of the MIC obtained by the SGE method for the five participating laboratories was +/- 0.26 of a twofold dilution, whereas it was +/- 1 twofold dilution by the reference method. The interlaboratory reproducibility of the results for two control strains tested with imipenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole indicated that 96% of the measurements fell within +/- 1 twofold dilution of the mode. The equivalence of the SGE method with the agar dilution method was assessed with a wide variety of anaerobic organisms. The MICs by both methods were within 1 doubling dilution in 93% of the measurements (n = 1,074). Discrepancies generally occurred with those organism-drug combinations that resulted in tailing endpoints (Fusobacterium nucleatum, 86% agreement) or in cases of light growth (Peptostreptococcus spp., 86% agreement).
TI  - Taxonomy, biology, and periodontal aspects of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The pathogenic potential of Fusobacterium nucleatum and its significance in the development of periodontal diseases, as well as in infections in other organs, have gained new interest for several reasons. First, this bacterium has the potential to be pathogenic because of its number and frequency in periodontal lesions, its production of tissue irritants, its synergism with other bacteria in mixed infections, and its ability to form aggregates with other suspected pathogens in periodontal disease and thus act as a bridge between early and late colonizers on the tooth surface. Second, of the microbial species that are statistically associated with periodontal disease, F. nucleatum is the most common in clinical infections of other body sites. Third, during the past few years, new techniques have made it possible to obtain more information about F. nucleatum on the genetic level, thereby also gaining better knowledge of the structure and functions of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs). OMPs are of great interest with respect to coaggregation, cell nutrition, and antibiotic susceptibility. This review covers what is known to date about F. nucleatum in general, such as taxonomy and biology, with special emphasis on its pathogenic potential. Its possible relationship to other periodontal bacteria in the development of periodontal diseases and the possible roles played by OMPs are considered.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil and monocyte defensive functions by nicotine.
AB  - To learn more about the effects of smokeless tobacco on the defensive functions of neutrophils, we studied the influence of nicotine on these cells in vitro, looking at their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, and at their ability to produce microbicidal reactive oxygen species (oxygen radicals). Exposure of human blood neutrophils to nicotine (0.01% to 0.1%) inhibited their ability to kill Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Although these concentrations of nicotine are high, such concentrations are relevant to phagocytes in the gingival sulcus, because smokeless tobacco contains 0.5% to 3.5% nicotine by dry weight. Nicotine had no such inhibitory effect when the killing assay was performed in an anaerobic environment, implying that nicotine preferentially affected oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms. To further investigate the effects of nicotine on production of oxygen radicals, neutrophils were primed with lipopolysaccharide and triggered with f-met-leu-phe or phorbol ester in the presence of nicotine. Nicotine inhibited production of superoxide anion (measured by reduction of cytochrome c) and hydrogen peroxide (measured by oxidation of phenol red). Nicotine inhibition of superoxide production was reversible by washing away the nicotine. By observing that nicotine inhibited the reduction of cytochrome c by reagent potassium superoxide, we determined that nicotine directly absorbed superoxide. In addition, by examining nicotine inhibition of the uptake of oxygen by neutrophils, we determined that nicotine also interfered with the production of oxygen radicals by these cells. Nicotine also inhibited production of superoxide and interleukin-1 beta by monocytes. Nicotine did not affect the viability of neutrophils and monocytes, as determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. Inhibition of the aerobic antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes by nicotine may alter the microbial ecology of the oral cavity, and this might be one mechanism by which nicotine compromises the oral health of users of tobacco products.
TI  - Viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium VMGA III.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the survival in VMGA III of Porphyromonas  gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. Laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and Escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. Also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in VMGA III. Each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. One portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). The results of the clinical part indicate that the detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. Enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. However, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. Similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for E. coli. P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum survived better in the presence of E. coli than alone, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with E. coli. VMGA III appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. After 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.
TI  - Cell envelope and cell wall immunization of Macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  - The nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. Animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. The high P. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low P. gingivalis numbers being recovered. P. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable P. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Bacteroides macacae and Prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp. and Eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. Campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of Fusobacterium spp. decreased. Plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. Pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth. Attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups, and the F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. Radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. Although immunization with P. gingivalis and P. intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted in greater bone loss than immunization with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.
TI  - [Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-HCl].
AB  - The present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of Periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. Samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. After sampling, Periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. The detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution of the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. In view of the MIC of minocycline-HCI for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including Periocline. However, clinical strains of P. i. were considered to have low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. In view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. From these results, it was suggested that Periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-HCl.
TI  - Stable-isotope studies of glutamate catabolism in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Catabolism of glutamate was investigated in Fusobacterium nucleatum, an anaerobic micro-organism that is strongly implicated in periodontal disease. The distribution of labels in acetate and butyrate derived from [13C]glutamates was determined by NMR spectroscopy and MS. The label from L-[5-13C]glutamate was not incorporated, whereas C-1 of acetate and butyrate were efficiently labelled by L-[1-13C]glutamate; these results indicated that the hydroxyglutarate pathway predominated. In butyrate, enrichment at C-3 was smaller than C-1; that this was not due to participation of the methylaspartate pathway was demonstrated by the incorporation of label from L-[4-13C]glutamate into only C-2 of acetate and C-4 (major)/C-2 (minor) of butyrate. The presence of label at a second site in butyrate was attributed to the synthesis of butyrate from acetate and verified by the incorporation of label from [1,2-13C2]- and [2H3]-acetate.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum inhibits human T-cell activation by arresting cells in the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including urinary tract infections, bacteremia, pericarditis, otitis media, and disorders of the oral cavity such as pulpal infections, alveolar bone abscesses, and periodontal disease. We have previously demonstrated that sonic extracts of F. nucleatum FDC 364 were capable of inhibiting human T-cell responses to mitogens and antigens. In this study, we have further characterized this immunosuppressive protein (FIP) and initiated experiments to determine its mode of action. The purified FIP has an apparent molecular mass of 90 to 100 kDa; sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the FIP is actually composed of two subunits with molecular masses of 48 and 44 kDa. Purified FIP retained its biological activity and was capable of inhibiting mitogen-induced proliferation of human T cells. Inhibition was dose dependent, and the FIP exhibited a specific activity approximately 250-fold greater than that of the crude extract. Cell cycle analysis indicates that FIP-treated cells were prevented from exiting the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, FIP did not alter the expression of activation markers (CD69, CD25, and CD71) or interleukin-2 secretion. The latter observations suggest that the T cells did indeed become activated and had entered the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Analysis of the expression of cyclins indicates that the phase of the cell cycle that is FIP sensitive resides somewhere beyond the restriction point of cyclin D2 (early to mid-G1) but prior to that of cyclins D3 and E (mid- to late G1). Finally, analysis of the expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen indicates that this is the earliest detectable defect in T cells exposed to FIP. We propose that if a block in the G1 phase of the cell cycle occurs in vivo in lymphocytes, it may result in a state of local and/or systemic immunosuppression. These suppressive effects could alter the nature and consequences of host-parasite interactions, thereby enhancing the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum itself or that of some other opportunistic organisms.
TI  - Intergeneric coaggregation of oral Treponema spp. with Fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - A total of 22 strains of Treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. None of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. All treponemes, eight Treponema denticola strains, eight T. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one T. pectinovorum strain, and one T. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the fusobacteria tested as partners. The partners consisted of one strain of Fusobacterium periodonticum, five F. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of F. nucleatum, and a strain of F. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. In the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees C for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. Furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase K treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. Only the T. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and D-galactosamine. None were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or L-arginine. Intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of F. nucleatum and with F. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by L-arginine. No intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. These data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. Such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.
TI  - Competition for peptides and amino acids among periodontal bacteria.
AB  - We recently studied the utilization of glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine), L-cysteinylglycine and L-cysteine by anaerobic bacteria. The rate of hydrogen sulfide formation from these compounds was determined and it was concluded that Peptostreptococcus micros and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum had an active transport of small peptides. In the present study it is shown that methyl mercaptan formation from L-methionine and L-methionyl-containing peptides can also be used to study peptide utilization. There were differences among the periodontal bacteria P. micros, F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in their capacity to use L-cysteine and L-methionine and peptides containing these amino acids. The peptides were used more efficiently by P. micros and F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum than by P. gingivalis. All three species used the peptides more efficiently than the free amino acids. The efficiency in utilizing various amino acids and peptides may be among the key determinants of the periodontal microbial ecology.
TI  - Endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  - Periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. This has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. These studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. The purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. Exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or not. It was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. The significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. Extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a 40-kDa outer membrane protein, FomA, of Fusobacterium periodonticum and comparison with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The 40 kDa-outer membrane protein FomA of Fusobacterium periodonticum ATCC 33693  was found to exhibit heat modifiable properties, typical for a porin, and N-terminal sequencing indicated a close relationship to the porin FomA of Fusobacterium nucleatum. A polymerase chain reaction approach was therefore applied for sequencing the fomA gene of F. periodonticum, and nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and compared with the corresponding sequences of different strains of F. nucleatum. In all strains we found a common protein upstream of the fomA gene. The noncoding area upstream of the putative -35 region of the F. periodonticum fomA gene exhibited little sequence similarity with the F. nucleatum gene. The transcriptional unit of FomA, on the other hand, was very similar, with the similarities concentrated in domains that were interspersed with hypervariable regions. A topology model was made and compared with those made for F. nucleatum. This indicated that the great similarities reside in the membrane-spanning segments of the protein, while most cell surface exposed loops were hypervariable. The results strongly support the proposed model for FomA and also indicate that these taxa are related but on a lower level than the subspecies level. The codon usage of F. periodonticum is comparable to that of F. nucleatum, and the triplet AGA is the only codon used for arginine.
TI  - 1H MRS of human brain abscesses in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - Five patients, each with a brain abscess, were examined by means of 1H MR spectroscopic imaging in vivo. The aspirated pus was analyzed in vitro by means of 1D and 2D COSY 1H MRS. In addition to resonance lines from compounds (lactate, alanine and lipids) often found in the spectra from intracranial tumors, resonance lines were detected from a number of markers of infectious involvement (acetate, succinate, and various amino acids). These results suggest that 1H MRS in vivo might contribute in establishing noninvasively a differential diagnosis between brain abscess and tumor.
TI  - The Fusobacterium nucleatum major outer-membrane protein (FomA) forms trimeric, water-filled channels in lipid bilayer membranes.
AB  - The pore-forming activity of the major outer-membrane protein FomA of the anaerobic Fusobacterium nucleatum was studied in artificial lipid bilayer membranes. FomA was isolated from F. nucleatum strains Fev1, ATCC 10953, and ATCC 25586 by extraction with lithium dodecyl sulfate and lithium chloride and had an apparent molecular mass of about 40 kDa. When solubilized at low temperatures, the protein ran with an apparent molecular mass of about 62 kDa on SDS/PAGE. Cross-linking experiments and two-dimensional SDS/PAGE gave evidence that the 62-kDa protein band represented the trimeric form of FomA. The protein trimers were susceptible to SDS and temperature. The stability of the porin trimers varied among the strains. The properties of the FomA channels were studied in reconstitution experiments with black lipid bilayer membranes. The F. nucleatum porins formed channels with single-channel conductances in the range 0.66-1.30 nS in M KCl. The single-channel conductance was a function of the mobilities of the ions present in the aqueous solution bathing the bilayer membrane. This means that FomA forms general diffusion channels since (a) the conductance showed a linear dependence on the salt concentration, (b) the ion selectivity was small and varied for the three strains, and (c) the channels did not exhibit any binding site for maltotriose or triglycine. The water-filled channel was voltage dependent, and conductance decrements were observed at transmembrane potentials of +/- 50 mV. The conductance decrement steps were about one-third of the total conductance of a functional unit in its fully 'open' state. This strongly suggests that the trimer is the functional unit of the porin.
TI  - Comparative virulence of periodontopathogens in a mouse abscess model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): This report compares the virulence of selected strains of P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, F. nucleatum and T. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. The characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in progressing periodontitis. DESIGN AND METHODS: All bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge BALB/c normal and BALB/c dexamethasone (DEX) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. The characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. OUTCOME MEASURES: The mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. RESULTS: Comparison of the virulence of the various P. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of P. gingivalis strains 53977>W50 = T22>3079>33277>381. C. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. The size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that C. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. A. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a PMN infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. Although each of the A. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113D-N = 3975A>JP2 > or = Y4>29523>33384. Both C. rectus and A. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. Challenge with F. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. A rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with F. nucleatum. Tissue involvement was also greater at lower F. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. F. nucleatum challenge of DEX-treated mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. T. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. Challenge of mice with T. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. In addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. In the DEX-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), P. gingivalis, C. rectus, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. In contrast, while DEX treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by F. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by F. nucleatum and T. denticola was not substantially enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.
TI  - Cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  - Dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. The origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. This study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. Vertebrate-type rather than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. Dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. Dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. Latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kD chymotrypsin-like proteinase from Treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin G but not by human plasmin. Incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium saburreum, Prevotella buccae and Porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. Doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an IC50-value of 20 microM. Dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type I and II collagens than type III collagen. Western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kD proform to a 58 kD active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. This reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as T. denticola or other PMN proteases such as cathepsin G.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Insertional inactivation of binding determinants of Streptococcus crista CC5A using Tn916.
AB  - Intermicrobial binding plays an important role in the ecology of the oral cavity  because it represents one mechanism by which specific bacteria colonize dental plaque. The formation of "corncobs", a morphologically distinct microbial unit composed of Streptococcus crista and Fusobacterium nucleatum, is a highly specific binding interaction that depends on the presence of polar tufts of fimbriae on the streptococci. We have used a genetic approach to examine the role of streptococcal cell surface components involved in the binding of S. crista to F. nucleatum. Such binding may be an important component of corncob formation. A method for the genetic transformation of S. crista was used to transfer the broad host range transposon, Tn916, into the bacteria. Cells were grown to early log phase in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% fetal calf serum. The competent cells were mixed with purified DNA from pDL916, a plasmid construct consisting of Tn916 and the streptococcal/Escherichia coli shuttle vector pDL278. Over 300 transformants were screened for a reduction in binding to F. nucleatum. Five of the transformants showed a change in binding ranging from 59% to 29% of the positive control values. Southern blots revealed that the binding-deficient transformants contained the Tn916 element integrated into one of 4 different sites in the chromosome. The transposon, integrated into 4 different sites, appeared to be stable in the absence of selective pressure. Based on these findings, it appears that some strains of S. crista are naturally competent and that insertional inactivation methods can be used to facilitate the study of binding receptors in this group of oral streptococci.
TI  - Effect of sonicated material from Fusobacterium nucleatum on the functional capacity of accessory cells derived from dental pulp.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum-derived components were studied for their effect on the ability of accessory pulpal cells to induce T-lymphocyte proliferation. In initial experiments, spleen cells were used to establish concentration ranges at which testing of the effect of the bacterial components would be suitable. At low concentrations, bacterial substances induced a stimulatory effect on the proliferation rate of spleen cells, but not when purified T-lymphocytes were incubated in the presence of concanavalin A and pulpal accessory cells. At increasing concentrations, a dose-dependent reduction was observed. Pretreatment with the bacterial products for 4 h gave a stimulatory effect in the absence of concanavalin A for both spleen cells and T-lymphocytes. Removal of low-molecular weight components (<3.5 kDa) did not influence the inhibitory effect, whereas preheating the bacterial substances to 100 degrees C eliminated the observed inhibition. Findings show that heat-sensitive, high-molecular-weight components of F. nucleatum can evoke a concentration-dependent stimulatory or suppressive effect on the proliferation rate of T-lymphocytes in the presence of accessory cells derived from the dental pulp.
TI  - Oral microbiota in subjects with a weak or strong response in experimental gingivitis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the composition of the oral microbiota in subjects who had previously demonstrated to develop either a weak or strong response to experimental gingivitis. For this study, subjects were selected from a pool of 25 individuals who had participated twice in an experimental gingivitis trial. Out of these 25 panellists, 6 subjects were selected who had developed 2X a weak gingival inflammatory response and 7 subjects who had developed 2X a strong gingival inflammatory response. Approximately 9 months after the 2nd experimental gingivitis trial, we evaluated the clinical condition and the prevalence of a panel of selected oral micro-organisms in these subjects. The subjects were clinically examined for the presence of plaque, bleeding, pocket depth and loss of attachment. For the microbiological evaluation, samples were taken from the mucous membranes, subgingival sites and saliva. Samples were analyzed for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, spirochaetes and motile rods. Clinical evaluation showed that most subjects had a relatively healthy periodontal condition. No clinically significant differences could be detected between the weak and strong responding groups. The microbial evaluation showed absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and P. micros in all subjects in either group. Analysis of the microbial data for the weak and strong responding group showed no differences between the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  - Periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. This has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. These studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. Significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: The experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. It was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. Extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of host tissue and bacterial dipeptidyl peptidases in human gingival crevicular fluid by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  - Earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) activities that resemble those in host tissue. Here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. Gingival tissue and GCF were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. DPP II and DPP IV fractions with acid and alkaline pH optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. Bacterial cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. There was moderate to strong DPP activity with Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella spp., very weak activity with Treponema denticola and no detectable activity with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Banding patterns in GCF, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. In gels washed with acid buffer, GCF had bands corresponding to tissue DPP II. Use of an alkaline washing buffer showed GCF activity which closely matched tissue DPP IV that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in the gingival crevice. P. Gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had counterparts in GCF. The apparent presence in GCF of the DPP from P. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.
TI  - Evaluation of periodontal treatments using controlled-release tetracycline fibers: microbiological response.
AB  - In a 12-month multi-center study of 116 adult periodontitis subjects, six putative periodontal pathogens were monitored by DNA probe methods in a subset of 31 subjects. Monitored species included Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Eikenella corrodens (Ec), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) with an average detection limit of 1.8 x 10(4) bacterial colony forming units/sample. The microbiological response to four periodontal treatments was studied, one treatment in each quadrant; scaling and root planing (S), scaling and root planing with tetracycline (TC) fiber (SF), a single application of TC fiber (F) and two serial applications of TC fiber (FF). Generally two sites were sampled in each quadrant, however, in some quadrants only one site was selected. These treatments were evaluated at baseline; immediately following therapy; and post-treatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The study was conducted with a split-mouth design with no maintenance therapy over a 12-month period. At baseline, 70.8% of sites had detectable Fn; 42.9% Pg; 63.5% Pi; 29.7% Ec; 28.3% Cr; and 5.5% Aa. No significant differences were seen in baseline proportions of these species between centers. Numbers and proportions of detectable pathogens (with the exception of Pg) exhibited a triphasic temporal response: a precipitous initial decrease immediately following therapy; a rise in proportions in the 1- to 3-month post-therapy period; and a spontaneous decline in the absence of therapy over the 3- to 12-month period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation of Porphyromonas gingivalis strain from tubal-ovarian abscess.
AB  - An unusual case of involvement of Porphyromonas gingivalis is described. Two anaerobic isolates, identified as Fusobacterium nucleatum and P. gingivalis, were recovered from the pus of a tubal-ovarian abscess in a 35-year-old woman. Identification of the P. gingivalis isolate was confirmed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting.
TI  - Occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in Chile.
AB  - The occurrence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (GJP) patients. The subgingival proportion of the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. The results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%) there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, E. corrodens, C. rectus, and F. nucleatum in LJP, and for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum in GJP. The mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (P < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. Capnocytophaga sp, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and E. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in LJP. When taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with LJP and GJP in Chile are P. gingivalis (66% of LJP and 80% of GJP affected sites), and A. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of LJP and 50% in GJP affected sites). Different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.
TI  - Effect of whole oral bacteria and extracted lipopolysaccharides on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.
AB  - Expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) on T cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the G0 to G1 transition and is the critical first step for T cell proliferation in response to antigen. The effect of whole periodontal bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IL-2R expression was examined in vitro. LPS induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity IL-2R alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on PBMC over untreated cells after 48 h culture. Addition of LPS to PBMC cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on IL-2R expression compared to untreated cultures. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) caused a similar effect to LPS in 48 h PBMC cultures but IL-1 also increased high affinity IL-2R expression in cultures depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. When antibody to IL-1 was simultaneously added with LPS to PBMC cultures, the high affinity IL-2R inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the LPS effect on PBMC IL-2R was indirect, via monocytes. Whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with PBMC at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:PBMC ratios had a similar effect to LPS, inducing high affinity IL-2R expression at 48 h. Increases in soluble IL-2R alpha were also measured in supernatants of PBMC incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to untreated controls. In this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate PBMC perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface LPS presented to adherent mononuclear cells.
TI  - Characteristics of multimodal co-aggregation between Fusobacterium nucleatum and  streptococci.
AB  - The co-aggregation characteristics between Fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococci were examined to clarify the adherence factors participating in the co-aggregation. Nineteen strains of F. nucleatum were classified into 8 groups according to co-aggregation titer and inhibition by L-arginine, L-lysine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (or lactose). The inhibition activity was, however, very different from strain to strain. With two fusobacterial strains, two inhibitors, which were both inhibition negative on their own, completely inhibited the co-aggregation when used together in a mixture. In some co-aggregation pairs, the protease treatment of F. nucleatum inactivated one of the adherence factors, and resulted in the change of inhibition characteristics. These results indicate the multimodal co-aggregation of F. nucleatum with streptococci mediated by L-arginine-sensitive, L-lysine-sensitive, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-sensitive and in some resistant factors, and that the adherence factor or factors participating the co-aggregation change according to the co-aggregation partners.
TI  - Volatile fatty acids, metabolic by-products of periodontopathic bacteria, inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production.
AB  - Short-chain fatty acids are a major by-product of anaerobic metabolism and can be detected in gingival fluid from periodontal pockets. Since most T cells are present subjacent to the pocket epithelium in conjunction with the plasma cells, it is important to know how these T cells are affected by short-chain fatty acids produced by subgingival plaque. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of extracellular metabolites from periodontopathic bacteria on the proliferation and cytokine production of mouse splenic cells as a potential mechanism of imbalance among host-microbial interactions. A low-molecular-weight, heat-stable agent present in the two-day culture filtrate of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum significantly depressed Con A- and LPS- induced cell proliferation. To determine whether short-chain fatty acids present in the filtrate could account for the depression, we tested extracted volatile and non-volatile fatty acids for their effects on mitogenic activity. The volatile fatty acids extracted from immunosuppressive supernatants greatly inhibited T- and B- cell proliferation. Among these volatile fatty acids, butyric, propionic, valeric, and isovaleric acids impaired cell proliferation dose-dependently. From gas-liquid chromatographic analysis data, it is suggested that immuno-inhibitory activities in culture filtrates are mainly attributable to butyric and isovaleric acids in P. gingivalis, to propionic, butyric, and isovaleric acids in P. loescheii, and to butyric acid in F. nucleatum. Furthermore, these fatty acids significantly depressed interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 production by Con A-stimulated splenic-T cells dose-dependently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A 6-month home-usage trial of 0.1% and 0.2% delmopinol mouthwashes (II). Effects  on the plaque microflora.
AB  - The effects of 0.1% and 0.2% delmopinol mouthwashes on supragingival plaque flora were investigated in a 6-month home-use study. 141 subjects were studied from whom plaque was collected at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Overall, there were no consistent effects on microscopic or total counts. However, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of dextran-producing streptococci in the active groups compared to the control group throughout treatment. There was no colonisation by Candida or Gram-negative aerobic bacilli in the active groups nor was there any decrease in susceptibility to delmopinol. Delmopinol appears to mediate its anti-plaque effect without causing a major shift in bacterial populations, although dextran-producing bacteria appear to be affected, which may have relevance to this agent's mode of action.
TI  - Effect of periodontal treatments on serum IgG antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Serum IgG antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. All patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. After the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. Serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. Serum IgG antibody titers against sonicated antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC 381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Prevotella loescheii ATCC 15930, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum ATCC 25586, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4, Eikenella corrodens FDC 1073 and Capnocytophaga ochracea # M 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean antibody titers to P. gingivalis and P. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. The antibody titer to P. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. A significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to P. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to P. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. These results suggest that the changes of serum IgG titers against P. gingivalis and P. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.
TI  - [Spondylodiscitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum. Apropos of a case].
AB  - Spondylodiscitis is rarely caused by anaerobic germs and occurs mainly in patients weakened by another infection. We report a case of Fusobacterium nucleatum spondylodiscitis in a 63-year-old man. This is the third such report and the second in a non-immunodepressed patient. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this type of spondylodiscitis vary little from those produced by other germs. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful diagnostic tool for spondylodiscitis. The germ is isolated from a discal puncture aspirate in 66% of the cases but can also be obtained from blood cultures. Anaerobic germs are usually sensitive to penicillin or cephalosporins.
TI  - Bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  - This study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with Asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Microbiological samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients. In the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (Group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. In the other 13 patients (Group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. In 7 patients of Group 1, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. In 4 patients of Group 2, P. intermedia, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. Biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kDa protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The 64-kDa protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a GroEL-like protein. The DNA fragment containing the groEL gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the groESL operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from A. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 64-kDa protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kDa proteins of Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Escherichia coli and Eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. It is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kDa protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
TI  - Some suspected periodontopathogens and serum antibody response in adult long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  - The subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. The material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. The bacterial species studied (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. Significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured P. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. Prevalence of P. gingivalis was associated with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. In diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).

TI  - Quantifying the strength of bacterial adhesive interactions with salivary glycoproteins.
AB  - We adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (McClay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. Bacteria are centrifuged onto human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. Plates are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. The force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. The bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (Streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (Actinomyces viscosus T14 V). These forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately 6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime tested against infrequently isolated pathogenic species (unusual pathogens).
AB  - The cefotaxime sodium spectrum of activity is very broad and includes many common species and a variety of less frequently isolated pathogens. We have reviewed the clinical microbiology literature (44 references) and the data base of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (Iowa City, IA) to collect data on the activity of cefotaxime against the less common species. Cefotaxime was consistently active against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Eikenella corrodens, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Pasteurella multocida, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The species Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, Flavobacterium spp., Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Rhodococcus equi were uniformly cefotaxime resistant. For many other species there was considerable variation in reported minimum inhibitory concentrations. These data may be helpful in guiding therapy of unusual infections, particularly in the case of fastidious species, where the appropriate susceptibility testing methodology may not be immediately or routinely available.
TI  - Fatal sepsis due to a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum  subspecies polymorphum.
AB  - A patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was treated empirically with imipenem for sepsis related to oropharyngeal infection and responded within 24 hours. When blood cultures yielded Streptococcus agalactiae, the regimen was changed to ampicillin and gentamicin. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, and she died 3 days later. After her death, a strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum producing beta-lactamase (PEN-Y; group 2a) was isolated from blood cultures. A literature review revealed increasingly frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing strains of F. nucleatum. Thus strains of F. nucleatum isolated from blood and other specimens from patients with serious infections should be tested for beta-lactamase production.
TI  - Attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum to fibronectin immobilized on gingival epithelial cells or glass coverslips.
AB  - To learn more about colonization of the oral epithelium by Fusobacterium nucleatum and the role of fibronectin in mediating adhesion of this microorganism, we studied attachment of this bacterium to cultured gingival epithelial cells that were coated with exogenous, purified plasma fibronectin. The three strains of F. nucleatum studied adhered in large numbers to epithelial cells that had been coated with fibronectin, compared with buffer-coated control cells. Bacterial adherence was also enhanced when epithelial cells were coated with whole human saliva. However, cells coated with saliva depleted of fibronectin did not facilitate adhesion of bacteria. Bacterial adhesion was restored when purified fibronectin was added back. We also tested adherence of bacteria to coverslips coated with fibronectin, saliva, and saliva depleted of fibronectin. The bacteria adhered to coverslips coated with fibronectin or whole human saliva, but did not adhere to coverslips coated with fibronectin-depleted saliva. Bacterial adhesion to coverslips was restored upon addition of purified fibronectin to the fibronectin-depleted saliva. Bacterial attachment to fibronectin-coated coverslips was found to be temperature-dependent, with maximal adhesion observed at 37 degrees C. Pre-treatment of F. nucleatum with soluble fibronectin inhibited attachment of the bacteria by 92%, whereas pre-treatment with bovine serum albumin had no effect. Pre-treatment of bacteria with laminin or type IV collagen caused moderate inhibition of attachment by 60% and 50%, respectively. Treatment of fibronectin-coated coverslips with Fab fragments of anti-fibronectin IgG blocked the attachment of F. nucleatum by 93%. Fab fragments of the other antisera tested had no inhibitory effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Spontaneous gingival antibody production to Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane in patients with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The local antibody response to Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane (FnOM) was  analyzed in patients with adult periodontitis (AP) at the single cell level. Furthermore, we analyzed whether periodontal hygienic treatment could alter the antibody response. The number of IgG- and IgM-producing cells were investigated in gingival samples collected from 20 patients with AP. The patients were divided into 2 groups, before (BT, n = 9) and after (AT, n = 11) periodontal hygienic treatment. Four healthy gingival samples were used as controls. The results obtained showed that local antibody production against FnOM occurred in gingiva of patients with AP, but not in healthy gingiva. The IgG anti-FnOM was the predominant isotype observed. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the BT and AT groups. These results indicate that periodontal hygienic treatment was not sufficient to alter significantly the number of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells present in gingival tissue of AP patients, but it promoted a reduction of IgG anti-FnOM secreting cells. The presence of anti-FnOM antibodies in AP but not in control patients indicates that this bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
TI  - The influence of intracellular polyglucose and prior growth rate on the survival  of Fusobacterium nucleatum under starvation conditions.
AB  - Grown in a chemically defined medium containing glucose at a dilution rate of D = 0.065 h-1, Fusobacterium nucleatum D212B-2 produced large amounts of intracellular polyglucose. Aliquots of this culture were starved by anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C and at various times, assayed for intracellular polyglucose content and viability. This protocol was repeated using cells grown under the same conditions in a chemically defined medium, a medium lacking carbohydrate and in which the organism produced no intracellular polyglucose. Both cultures had 50% survival time values of about 1.5 h and were not eliminated even after 32 h of starvation. It was, therefore concluded that starvation-survival is not influenced by intracellular polyglucose. Starvation-survival was also determined for cells grown in a chemically defined medium at D = 0.048 h-1 and D = 0.12 h-1. The faster-grown cells had a 50% survival time of 3.8 h but were completely eliminated after 8-16 h of starvation. In contrast, slower-grown cells had a 50% survival time of 1.5 h but were not completely eliminated after 32 h of starvation. This illustrates the importance of cell history and technique standardization in comparing the starvation-survival of different organisms.
TI  - Cellular adhesion molecules on periodontal lymphocytes.
AB  - T cell induced differentiation of B cells has been shown to be dependent on the CD2/LFA-3 and LFA-1/ICAM-1 pathways. Flow cytometric analysis was used to examine these adhesion molecules on T and B cells extracted from gingival tissues before and after stimulation with the putative periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood cells from healthy adults was used as a control. Approximately 50 per cent of B cells extracted from gingival tissues expressed LFA-3 and ICAM-1 compared with 30 per cent positive peripheral blood B cells. Around 50 per cent of gingival T cells expressed CD2 relative to 76 per cent positive peripheral blood T cells. However, 40-50 per cent of both gingival and peripheral blood T cells expressed LFA-1. There was no difference in the expression of adhesion molecules on T and B cells extracted from health/marginal gingivitis or adult periodontitis lesions. After stimulation of gingival cells in vitro, the per cent CD2 positive T cells and LFA-3 and ICAM-1 positive B cells remained relatively stable over the six-day culture period, although P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum appeared to induce an increase in the percentage of gingival T cells expressing LFA-1. In contrast to the gingival lymphocytes, stimulation of peripheral blood cells resulted in an increase in the per cent CD2 positive T cells, LFA-3 and ICAM-1 positive B cells, with a decrease in LFA-1 positive T cells. The results therefore demonstrated that gingival T and B cells express adhesion molecules in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  - This report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. Tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. Tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. Microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. After implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. Following fixture placement, P. intermedia replaced P. melaninogenica as the predominant Black Pigmented Anaerobic Bacilli (BPAB) in the mouth. After abutment connection stage, levels of P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatun, Haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. Three months after bridge installations, P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. At six months after bridge installation, levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. P. intermedia, Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. Correlation was detected between P. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. Our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.

TI  - Effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  - Human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the DNA content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. LPS samples were purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS was used as a positive control. At a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the LPSs caused any change in the production of DNA or protein, whereas the amount of DNA was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. Protein synthesis was decreased by LPSs at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. Alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of LPS tested.

AB  - Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
TI  - Bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  - Periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (JP), rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP), and adult periodontitis (AP), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. These disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. The present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of PBMC of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. The AP group had a significantly lower production of IL-1ra when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) (P < 0.05). Streptococcus sanguis (S.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha production in all groups. The RPP group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (MC) than the AP group (P < 0.05). Additionally, JP patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or IL-6 production by peripheral blood MC after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. The results support the hypothesis that the cytokine IL-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: RPP and AP. Furthermore, elevated MC concentration in the RPP group compared to the AP group may be an important pathogenic feature in RPP.
TI  - Microbial flora of sinus tracts and root canals of non-vital teeth.
AB  - The occurrence of bacteria in 12 endodontically induced periodontal lesions associated with sinus tracts was examined. The microbial flora encountered in the sinus tract was compared with that of the root canal of the involved teeth which had not experienced any prior endodontic therapy. All microbiological samples taken from the sinus tract and from the root canal system contained bacteria. Seventy-one strains were detected in the extraradicular lesions. Of the anaerobic species, Fusobacterium nucleatum (7 strains), Prevotella intemedia (4 strains) and P. oralis (4 strains) were most frequently found. In the group of the facultative anaerobes Streptococcus spp. were predominant. Ninety-four strains were isolated from the root canal system of the 12 teeth. P. intermedia (6 strains), P. buccae (5 strains), F. nucleatum (5 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5 strains) were most common. In 9 cases, species present in the root canal could be revealed in the extraradicular lesions. It was concluded that a variety of microorganisms were capable of colonizing endodontically induced, extraradicular lesions clinically characterized by sinus tracts.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial effects of extracts of Nigerian tooth-cleaning sticks on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Aqueous extracts from 8 plants used for tooth-cleaning in Nigeria were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of five periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens and Campylobacter rectus. Extracts of all the plants except that of Massularia acuminata exhibited varying growth inhibitory potentials on the microorganisms. Extract of Terminalia glaucescens showed the widest spectrum of activity, inhibiting the growth of all the tested bacteria except P. gingivalis. These findings corroborate other studies that the plants possess antiplaque properties and suggest that they may be useful tools in preventive dentistry in poor developing countries. However, the bioavailability of the active ingredients of the plants and their long term effects in vivo need to be investigated.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathic bacteria associated with failing implants.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the subgingival microflora associated with failing implants, and to determine their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics in periodontal therapy and dental practice. Thirteen partially edentulous patients with 19 failing implants were selected. Clinical examination included probing depth, attachment level, gingival index, plaque index, and radiographic analyses. Two subgingival plaque samples were taken from each failing implant and analyzed for microbial composition. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia were the prevalent cultivable microflora. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was determined by the agar dilution technique. Antibacterial activity of penicillin G, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the combination amoxicillin-metronidazole was significantly higher than with other antibiotics tested. These data indicated that the commonly-used antibiotics were highly effective against bacteria isolated around failing implants, which would suggest the use of these antibiotics to control peri-implant infections.
TI  - Cytology of pulmonary Fusobacterium nucleatum infection. A case report.
AB  - A patient with pulmonary Fusobacterium nucleatum infection presenting as a solitary nodule is reported. The infectious nature of the lung nodule was disclosed by ultrasound-guided percutaneous transthoracic fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) with Liu's stain. The cytologic characteristics of F nucleatum infection are described. The usefulness of real-time ultrasound in fine needle aspiration diagnosis of a peripheral lung lesion is demonstrated, and the role of Liu's stain in FNAC is emphasized.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, a new invasive pathogen in neutropenic patients?
AB  - Three chemotherapy-induced neutropenic hematologic patients with severe systemic  infection caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobic rod, are described. Anaerobic infections are not very common in this patient category, but in a short period of time, several such patients were seen. The infection was considered to be caused by a combination of chemotherapy-induced mucositis, which served as a portal of entry for the systemic infection, and the antibiotic regime used in these patients. This is a serious infection with a high mortality. In hematological neutropenic patients suffering from severe mucositis and fever, antibiotic therapy should cover anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Mobile genetic elements of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, is a predominant  member of the human oral flora. As a major component of subgingival plaque, this bacterium has a significant impact on the ecology of the oral cavity due to its ability to adhere to many different microbial species. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize plasmids and transposons that may have the potential to be developed into tools for cloning, genetic transformation, and mutagenesis of oral isolates of F. nucleatum. Analysis of a collection of laboratory strains resulted in the identification of a homologous family of small cryptic plasmids. Plasmids within this family ranged in size from 6.0 to 6.6 kb. Eighteen percent of all strains examined (n = 74) contained DNA sequences related to the plasmids. Homologous plasmid sequences were found in strains belonging to 2 of the 3 subspecies of the bacterium. The 2 smallest plasmid species were cloned in Escherichia coli to facilitate endonuclease restriction mapping. Among the strains examined for plasmids, 5 exhibited resistance to at least 10 micrograms/ml of tetracycline. These strains, all members of the subsp. polymorphum, contained a tetracycline resistance determinant (TetM) as part of a Tn916-like integrated transposon sequence. The Tn916-like element and 1 of the plasmid species co-resided in a single strain of the bacterium. Hybridization patterns of the Tn916-like sequences were identical in all 5 tetracycline-resistant strains. However, these strains appeared to be clonally distinct based on genomic fingerprinting.
TI  - Predominant microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study the microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions, in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from 142 periodontal lesions in 10 young adults aging 25 to 35 years. The examination of the subgingival microflora indicated that certain species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were found to be predominant in severe periodontal lesions. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, were predominant in medium lesions while Streptococcus species and Actinomyces species, C. ochracea, Haemophilus segnis and Veillonella parvula, were found in higher levels in minimal periodontal lesions.
TI  - Biological activities of lipopolysaccharides from oral bacteria and their relevance to the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Chronic periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss in adults and is a consequence of the colonisation of the subgingival region by organisms such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a constituent of the cell walls of all of these bacteria and is found in large quantities on the surfaces of periodontally-diseased teeth. LPS from oral bacteria has a marked effect on most types of cell found in the periodontal tissues including macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. Fibroblasts and macrophages respond to oral LPS by secreting a range of cytokines, and other effector molecules, with inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-destroying capabilities. Lymphocytes are stimulated by LPS to produce a wide range of antibodies with different specificities, hence exacerbating the inflammatory response. By its actions on bone cells, LPS can stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation resulting in erosion of the tooth-supporting alveolar bone. There is, therefore, considerable evidence implicating LPS in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. However, the possible involvement of other biologically-active bacterial components must not be overlooked.
TI  - Heat shock proteins in the human periodontal disease process.
AB  - The production of HSP by periodontopathic Gram-negative bacteria was examined by  SDS-PAGE, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against HSPs. Strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Treponema socranskii species produced HSP which reacted with anti-Yersinia enterocolitica HSP 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kDA HSP monoclonal antibodies. It found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human HSP were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. The present study suggests that HSPs are implicated in human periodontal disease process.
TI  - Peptide mapping and amino acid sequence analysis of the 40 kDa outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  
TI  - Degradation of immunoglobulin G by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a substrate for growth. This was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with IgG. Stimulation of growth was observed for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oralis, Lactobacillus catenaforme and Streptococcus intermedius. Immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that P. intermedia and P. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of IgG. Partial breakdown of IgG was observed for P. asaccharolytica and C. ochracea, whereas P. oralis cleaved the IgG heavy chain, yielding Fc and Fab fragments. All these bacteria utilized IgG as a substrate for growth. Binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific IgG with P. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, C. ochracea or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Degradation or inactivation of IgG by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - The gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - A gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. Gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eubacterium nodatum and Fusobacterium nucleatum and one nonoral microorganism, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were E. nodatum (72%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). More juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to P. intermedia, C. ochracea, E. nodatum and P. micros. No significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. Cluster analysis revealed the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of P. micros and C. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. The data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Chemostat flow cell system: an in vitro model for the evaluation of antiplaque agents.
AB  - We developed an experimental in vitro model of dental plaque to assess the potential efficacy of antiplaque agents. The model used a chemostat, which provided a continuous source of 5 species of oral bacteria grown in an artificial "saliva-like" medium. This mixture was pumped through six flow cells, each containing two types of surfaces on which plaque formed and was subsequently measured. Formation of bacterial plaque on hydroxyapatite surfaces was assessed by measurement of the DNA and protein content of the plaque film. The amount of bacterial plaque formed on germanium surfaces was measured by attenuated total reflectance (ATR/FT-IR) spectroscopy. Plaque viability was also assessed by a fluorescent staining technique. The quantity of plaque formed on both types of surfaces gradually increased with the duration of flow (from 24 to 72 h) through the cells during a 72-hour experimental period. The flow cells were then pulsed with experimental treatment solutions for 30 s, twice daily. Parallel to results of human clinical studies, the model was capable of discriminating among water, a placebo mouthrinse, and an active antimicrobial mouthrinse formulation containing 0.03% triclosan. It therefore offers a valuable alternative to animal model testing and allows for more rapid evaluations under well-controlled experimental conditions.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effects of controlled-release locally delivered minocycline in periodontitis.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of minocycline in a subgingival local delivery system was evaluated alone (M) or as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (M + SRP), in comparison to scaling and root planing (SRP) or to no subgingival treatment (NoTx) in adult periodontitis. Fifty-one adult patients with > or = 7 mm periodontal pockets demonstrating the presence by culture of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (P(i)), or Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) were randomized into one of the above 4 treatment groups. All sites > or = 5 mm in the most diseased quadrant in each patient received the therapy. Other quadrants were not treated. All patients received standardized oral hygiene instructions at the beginning of the study. At 0, 1, 3 and 6 months following therapy the 7 mm experimental sites were evaluated for selected periodontal pathogens by DNA probe analysis. At these same time points, the plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding on probing were evaluated as well as probing depth and relative clinical attachment level which were assessed by means of an automated probe. Probing depth reduction with M + SRP was significantly greater than all other groups at one month and significantly greater than NoTx and SRP at 3 months. There were no differences in probing depth reduction among groups at 6 months. At 6 months the gain in clinical attachment level was significantly greater for SRP than for either the NoTx or M groups. The prevalence of Pg decreased significantly in the M and M + SRP groups at one month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbial associations of 4 putative periodontal pathogens in Sudanese adult periodontitis patients determined by DNA probe analysis.
AB  - The few previous cultivation studies on the in vivo associations between various  periodontal microbial species have shown several positive and negative associations. The present investigation utilized DNA probe analysis to examine possible in vivo associations between the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides forsythus in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 Sudanese untreated adult periodontitis patients. The standard paper point technique was used to sample 99 sites with a mean probing depth of 6.8 mm (range 6.0 to 10.0). Microbial associations were determined by detecting the effect of the presence or absence of one species (effector) on the occurrence of the other 3 species (target). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine variations in occurrence of each target bacteria in the presence or absence of the effector. In addition, the Spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess the relationship between the level of each bacteria to that of the other 3. Results showed bacterial associations with the following effector-on-target effects: F. nucleatum (P < 0.01 Wilcoxon; P < 0.001 Spearman) >> P. gingivalis (P < 0.01 Wilcoxon; P < 0.001 Spearman), and B. forsythus (P < 0.05 Wilcoxon; P < 0.001 Spearman) > P. intermedia (P < 0.01 Spearman). The study demonstrated positive associations between the 4 species investigated, while no neutral or negative associations were revealed. The most striking finding was the effect exerted by F. nucleatum on the colonization of P. intermedia; P. intermedia was never detected in a site unless F. nucleatum was also present.
TI  - Comparative detection frequency of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in Sudanese and Norwegian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  - Twenty-five sudanese and 18 norwegian adult periodontitis patients were selected  to participate in this study. The purpose was to compare cultivation results of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in both populations. In addition, DNA probe analysis was used to identify P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and Bacteroides forsythus in the Sudanese patients and results were compared with those obtained by cultivation. The paper point technique was used to sample 99 sites in the Sudanese group (4 paper points/site) and 119 sites in the Norwegian patients (3 paper points/site). In the Sudanese subjects, the fourth paper point was used for the DNA probe analysis. The chi-square test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to test for statistically significant differences between Sudanese and Norwegian cultivation results as well as between cultivation and DNA results in the Sudanese group. Cultivation results indicated that the Sudanese subjects had significantly lower prevalence of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum (P < 0.01), significantly higher prevalence of Capnocytophaga species (P < 0.05), and similar prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Almost all Sudanese subjects tested positive for various enteric rods, while none of the Norwegians did so. The extent to which unrestricted use of antibiotics and transport media influenced the levels of enteric species is not known, however.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of treatment on some periodontopathogens and their antibody levels in periodontal abscesses.
AB  - Twenty patients suffering from abscess of periodontal origin were treated and followed clinically and microbiologically for 6 months. Microbiological examination was performed by culture technique. One deep and one shallow periodontal pocket in the same patient were examined concomitantly. Serum was collected and analyzed for specific antibody level using ELISA methodology. Treatment included supragingival scaling, drainage, and irrigation of the periodontal pocket with 0.85% sodium chloride and systemic tetracycline administration, 1 g per day for 2 weeks. At baseline, 90% of the abscesses harbored Porphyromonas gingivalis and/or Prevotella intermedia. After 6 months, abscess sites demonstrated a reduced probing depth, less bleeding on probing, and gain of attachment. Abscess sites showed no P. gingivalis and the proportion of P. intermedia was significantly reduced 6 months after treatment. In deep periodontal pockets a similar pattern was seen. Shallow pockets demonstrated few clinical signs of inflammation and the number of bacteria was generally low. Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently seen in low numbers in most sites during the study period, while Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected only in a few sites. The IgG levels in patient sera against antigens of homologous bacterial strains remained fairly constant for 6 months. The result of the present study indicates that P. gingivalis and P. intermedia are involved in periodontal abscess formation. Also, treatment where drainage is combined with tetracycline administration promotes healing and reattachment.
TI  - Some microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of progressive periodontal disease.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to study the local nature of human periodontal disease by assessing the microbiota and the composition of the tissue lesions at sites with progressive attachment loss in periodontitis susceptible subjects. 300 subjects with periodontal disease were monitored for 2 years without treatment. 8 subjects lost > 2 mm of attachment at > or = 3 sites during both the first and the second 12 month interval. These 8 subjects (progressive disease group; PD) were recalled for a microbiological and histopathological examination. A group of age- and sex-matched subjects were identified who during the 2 years of monitoring exhibited gingivitis and deep pockets, but no further attachment loss. This group of 11 subjects (non-progressive disease group; NPD) served as controls. From the 8 active disease subjects, > or = 1 interproximal site which had displayed disease activity (progressive disease active; PDA) and > or = 1 contralateral site without disease progression (progressive disease inactive; PDI) were sampled. From the 11 control subjects, 1 site/subject was sampled (NPD). The total number of viable micro-organisms (TVC) in the subgingival microbiota was estimated and a series of bacterial species were identified and enumerated. The gingival tissue of the sampling site was excised and the soft tissue prepared for morphometrical and immunohistochemical analyses. No differences were observed in the subgingival microbiota of the sample sites in the subjects who exhibited disease progression (PD) when compared with the subjects with periodontally diseased but stable conditions (NPD).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - Associations of specific bacteria with some endodontic signs and symptoms.
AB  - Although a wide range of bacterial species has been isolated from infected dental root canals it remains necessary to determine whether any particular group of such bacteria is associated with specific endodontic symptoms and clinical signs. In this study 30 root canals were examined microbiologically; of these, 14 were associated with pain, 20 with tenderness to percussion, 23 presented with wet root canals, seven with swelling, five with purulent exudate and four with a sinus. Clinical and microbiological correlation was observed particularly with regard to pain where anaerobes were isolated from 93% of painful canals and only from 53% of painfree canals. The former yielded means of 2.5 anaerobic species and 1.6 facultative species per canal, compared with 1.5 and 2.4 in painfree canals. Prevotella spp. were isolated from 64.2% of painful canals and 12.5% of painless canals (P < 0.01) similarly, peptostreptococci were isolated from 71.4% of painful and 31.3% of painless canals (P < 0.05). It was concluded that a significant association exists between pain and the presence of Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus spp. in dental root canals.
TI  - Sizing the Fusobacterium nucleatum genome by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The genome sizes of Fusobacterium nucleatum strains F1, F3, F6, ATCC 10953, ATCC  25586 and Fev1 were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The restriction enzymes SmaI, SacII,SalI and XhoI were found to generate a reasonable number of DNA fragments which could be separated by PFGE in agarose gels. The apparent chromosomal lengths of the F. nucleatum strains were determined to be approximately 2.4 million base pairs. This was within the size-range found by experiments exploiting renaturation kinetics.
TI  - Orogenital contact: a cause of chorioamnionitis?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species are common oral pathogens and infrequent causes of systemic infection in patients with compromised immunity or disrupted mucosal integrity. The isolation of both organisms from a clinical specimen suggests an oral source of infection. CASE: A 23-year-old black woman was admitted at 24 weeks' gestation in preterm labor. She subsequently developed signs of clinical chorioamnionitis, including fever, fetal tachycardia, and uterine tenderness. Bacteriologic studies of the amniotic fluid and subchorionic placental cultures yielded F nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species. On review of the patient's history, a temporal relation was noted between orogenital contact and the onset of clinical infection. Thorough evaluation of the patient, including dental examination, did not reveal an obvious source of infection. However, significant periodontal disease was identified in her partner. CONCLUSION: The concomitant finding of these two organisms in the patient's amniotic fluid and a history of periodontal disease in her partner suggests that chorioamnionitis may have been due to an ascending infection after orogenital contact.
TI  - In-vitro activity of clinafloxacin (CI-960) and PD 131628-2 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of two new quinolones, CI-960 and PD 131628-2 were determined against 339 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole. The NCCLS-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique with Brucella-lysed blood agar was used throughout the study. Breakpoints of the new quinolones are 2 mg/L, and breakpoints for cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole are 32, 8 and 16 mg/L, respectively. CI-960 displayed excellent activity, inhibiting all strains tested at 1 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited 94% of Bacteroides fragilis, 75% of other B. fragilis group isolates, 87% of Prevotella spp, 79% of the Fusobacterium mortiferum-varium group, 74% of non-sporing gram-positive bacilli, and 89-100% of Clostridium spp other than Clostridium difficile at 2 mg/L. None of the eight strains of C. difficile was inhibited at 2 mg/L although they were inhibited at 4 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited all strains of other Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Fusobacterium nucleatum at < or = 1 mg/L.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - Utilization of glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) by Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum.
AB  - Although fusobacteria use amino acids and peptides as energy source, it is not known whether they are able to actively transport peptides into the cell. In the present study the tripeptide glutathione was used as a model substance to investigate peptide uptake in Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum. Cells harvested after 2 days of growth on blood agar or in their exponential growth phase in broth were suspended in buffer with glutathione, L-cysteinylglycine and L-cysteine. As a measure of cell uptake, the formation of hydrogen sulfide was followed. Cells from blood agar had a low capacity to form hydrogen sulfide from the tripeptide glutathione and the dipeptide L-cysteinylglycine. However, hydrogen sulfide was formed from L-cysteinylglycine, but not from glutathione or from L-cysteine, by cells grown in broth in such a way that it strongly indicated an active transport of L-cysteinylglycine with a Km of 18 microM. Hydrogen sulfide was efficiently formed from glutathione by cells grown in broth in the presence 1 mM glutathione. In these cells a glycylglycine-dependent L-gamma-glutamyl peptidase activity was induced. It is probable that the efficient utilization of glutathione for hydrogen sulfide formation mirrored the uptake of L-cysteinylglycine after an L-gamma-glutamyl peptidase had split L-glutamate off from glutathione.
TI  - Cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  - Cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by Cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. Interaction studies were made by adding each of the different UV-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. The reference oral bacterial strains were: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 209 and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The target cells were: gingival fibroblasts (GF), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (PMF), pulpal fibroblasts (PF), HeLa-cells (HeLa), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (LN). Synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. The cytotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of P. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of S. aureus it was increased. Bacterial interactions with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. The cytotoxicity of F. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.
TI  - Bacteriological diagnosis of periodontal disease.
AB  - Dental plaque bacteria cause virtually all the forms of inflammatory periodontal  disease. Periodontitis is caused by the specific periodontopathic bacteria, which induce destruction of connective tissue attachment and adjacent alveolar bone. Examinations to identify the infections by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens and Treponema denticola have recently become essential in diagnosis of periodontal disease. Bacterial examination permits (1) identification of the causative bacteria, (2) assessment of disease activity and (3) monitoring of the effective of periodontal treatments. The author describes details of accurate and rapid methods for detecting periodontopathogens. Transmission of periodontopathic bacteria as clarified by bacterial examination is also discussed in this review. The pathogenic potential of specific bacteria varies among patients and periodontally healthy individuals and can be controlled by host defense mechanisms such as immune responses. The roles of immune responses against periodontopathic bacteria in balance shifts of periodontal disease processes are therefore also discussed in this review.
TI  - Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. The effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K on cell lysis was determined following incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. Overall, gram-positive bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were Actinomyces spp., Eubacterium saburreum, Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loescheii, Treponema denticola and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of Actinomyces spp., E. saburreum, C. ochracea, P. intermedia, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas gingivalis and T. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Interestingly, the growth of F. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. The observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their growth. It is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils and essential oil components towards oral bacteria.
AB  - A method for reproducibly determining minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of plant extracts towards fastidiously and facultatively anaerobic oral bacteria, predicated upon measurements of optical densities in microtitre plate wells, was devised. The antimicrobial properties of some botanical oils were surveyed; of these, Australian tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and sage oil proved to be the most potent essential oils, whereas thymol and eugenol were potent essential oil components.
TI  - Sequence variability of the 40-kDa outer membrane proteins of Fusobacterium nucleatum strains and a model for the topology of the proteins.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the fomA genes encoding the 40-kDa outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of strains ATCC 10953 and ATCC 25586 of Fusobacterium nucleatum were determined using the genomic DNA, or DNA fragments ligated into a vector plasmid, as template in a polymerase chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequences of these two proteins were aligned with the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein of F. nucleatum strain Fev1 and examined for conserved/variable polypeptide segments. A model for the topology of the 40-kDa OMPs is proposed on the basis of this alignment and application of the structural principles derived for OMPs of Escherichia coli. According to this model, sixteen polypeptide segments, which are highly conserved, traverse the outer membrane, thereby creating eight external loops, most of which are highly variable.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontal pathogens with varying metabolic control of diabetes mellitus.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of 5 periodontal pathogens in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Subjects (n = 107) 20-70 years of age with type 1 (n = 60) or 2 (n = 47) diabetes mellitus were studied for the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, E. corrodens, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia. Subgingival plaque was sampled in each subject from a single site exhibiting the greatest inflammation. The evaluation of selected periodontal bacterial pathogens was based on an immunoassay utilizing bacterial specific monoclonal antibodies. 35% of the sites harbored P. gingivalis, 28% F. nucleatum and 21% E. corrodens. A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. intermedia were found in less than 10% of the sites. Subjects for whom the probing depth at the sampled site was > or = 4 mm were more often found to have detectable pathogens than those with a probing depth < or = 3 mm. Diabetic factors such as duration, type and metabolic control of the disease had no statistically significant effect on the prevalence of these bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ICI 194660, CAS 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. They included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), Prevotella bivia (n = 11), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), Clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. Selenomonas sputigena and Clostridium symbiosum. Bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, Clostridium species, including C. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. Meropenem was especially active against Bacteroides gracilis (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Prevotella disiens (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml), Fusobacterium nucleatum (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml) and Veillonella parvula (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml). The results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
TI  - Subgingival temperature in rats with natural gingivitis.
AB  - Elevated temperature, normally a characteristic of inflammation, is a potential indicator of periodontal disease. The present investigation examined the relationship of subgingival temperature and various indicators of gingivitis in rats with spontaneous gingivitis (SUS rat) and in control rats (RES rat). In 24 SUS rats with gingivitis, the subgingival temperature rose, but not in 6 SUS and 20 RES rats with healthy gingiva. Subjects with high mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean percentages of Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum than age-matched RES rats. The results show that dental plaque, including specific bacteria P. intermedia and F. nucleatum, can play some role in causing the elevated temperatures.
TI  - The bacteria of periodontal diseases.
AB  
TI  - Regulation of neutrophil responses by phosphotyrosine phosphatase.
AB  - By using immunofluorescent flow cytometry, we observed a profound up-regulation of CD45 on the plasma membrane of neutrophils exposed to low levels of a culture supernatant of the Gram-negative pathogen, Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN). Plasma membranes of neutrophils freshly prepared form human blood possessed little enzymatically active phosphotyrosine phosphatase. The activity of this enzyme was markedly potentiated in plasma membranes prepared from cells preexposed to the FN culture supernatant. This activity was vanadate sensitive and could be immunoprecipitated with anti-CD45 Ab. Cells preexposed to the FN culture supernatant were inhibited in their ability to release superoxide when challenged with the bacterial chemotactic factor, FMLP, but not PMA. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, likewise inhibited FMLP but not PMA-induced superoxide release. Pretreatment of neutrophils with vanadate reversed FN-mediated inhibition of FMLP-triggered superoxide release but had no effect on genistein-mediated inhibition of FMLP-induced superoxide release. Of several proteins tyrosine phosphorylated in response to treatment of neutrophils with FMLP, Western analysis revealed one (m.w. approximately 93,000) that was lost when FMLP-stimulated cells were exposed to FN. This effect was inhibited when the cells were preexposed to vanadate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that plasma membrane tyrosine phosphatase modulates FMLP-induced superoxide release by reversing the effects of tyrosine kinases activated in the initial phases of cell stimulation.
TI  - Comparison of DNA probe and ELISA microbial analysis methods and their association with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the DNA probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. A single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. Twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. The experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. A total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. All of these samples were used to compare the DNA probe and ELISA methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. DNA probes were used to assay for A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, T. denticola, and C. rectus. An ELISA utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, T. denticola, and C. rectus. Comparison of the two methods revealed that the ELISA test identified P. gingivalis and C. rectus significantly more often than the DNA probe method and that T. denticola was detected more frequently with the DNA probe. The sensitivities and specificities varied widely among organisms and by test. P. gingivalis, as identified by ELISA, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.
TI  - The oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora in young children: longitudinal changes from edentulous to dentate mouth.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. The bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). During the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. Both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. Prevotella melaninogenica, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum group and Capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. The occurrence of Prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, Prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, Leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, Campylobacter (Wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and Eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. Only the occurrence of Bacteroides gracilis and Veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. Species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as Prevotella denticola, Fusobacterium spp. other than the F. nucleatum group and Selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. The stability of the colonizing P. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification and analyses of periodontal pathogens in Taiwan by microbiological tests.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use microbiological tests for diagnosis of periodontal diseases in Taiwan. Anaerobic culture, direct microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence (IF), and biochemical tests were used to examine 336 samples for the specific microorganisms in subgingival plaque. The results indicated that gram-negative species and motile bacteria were less frequently detected, and in lower proportion, in samples from healthy sites. The bacteria found frequently in healthy group were the coccal forms. However, Bacteroides forsythus detected by IF showed a close association with periodontal inflammation. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found with about 53% frequency in the periodontitis group; in more than half the samples the proportion was above 5%. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was recovered with 48% frequency of periodontitis group. Other cultivable species including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, Centipeda periodontii, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas species, and the Spirochetes were detected in a significantly higher proportion in periodontitis group. The results strongly support the use of microbiological tests as adjuncts to diagnosis, and for assessment of the importance of microbiota in periodontal disease.
TI  - Antibiotics can prevent implant failure.
AB  
TI  - Polyclonal B cell activation, endotoxin tolerance, and limulus tests of endotoxin preparations of some periodontopathogens.
AB  - Potencies of polyclonal B-cell activation in C3H/HeN mice of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis endotoxins were 0.36, 0.13 and 0.04, taking Salmonella abortusequi as 1.0. F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis endotoxins showed positive reactions in C3H/HeJ mice. Most activities in C3H/HeN other than that of F. nucleatum were suppressed by polymyxin B. In C3H/HeJ mice, similar inhibitions were only 60% for P. gingivalis and hardly observed with F. nucleatum. The resistances to polymyxin B could be due to protein in the endotoxins. A promoting effect of T cells added to B cells was observed only in the activity of F. nucleatum endotoxin in C3H/HeJ mice; there was no influence in other groups. Test endotoxins had nearly the same ability to produce colony stimulating factor as did references and could not produce the factor in tolerant mice. The clinical significance of tolerance is discussed. Regression lines of endotoxin doses and limulus activities of test endotoxins and Salmonella were parallel, either in specific or non-specific tests. The lines of two test groups were also parallel; values obtained by two tests were very close. These data indicate that the test endotoxins did not contain (1-3)-beta-D-glucan and elicited qualitatively similar limulus reactions to that of the reference, despite their different chemical natures. In conclusion, these test preparations had an endotoxicity similar to that of the reference and contribute to produce periodontitis through polyclonal B cell activation.
TI  - Impaired bactericidal activity of PMN from two brothers with necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis (ANUP) diagnosed in two brothers, age 9 (ANUP1) and 14 (ANUP2) from rural Egypt. Complete blood count, differential and blood chemistry were within normal limits for both brothers and they were not malnourished. The phagocytosis and killing function of their polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) towards four bacterial species were assessed using a fluorochrome microassay. The selection of bacterial species was based on preliminary microbiological results in early onset periodontitis in Egypt. Fluorochrome-labeled Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were pre-opsonized with ANUP serum and added to PMN from both ANUP patients, as well as PMN from three sex-matched and two sex- and age-matched healthy Egyptian control (CTL) subjects. We found significant depressions (P < 0.05) in PMN phagocytosis and killing of C. rectus and P. intermedia by ANUP1 and ANUP2, when compared to all CTL PMN. An assessment of the Gram-negative subgingival microflora present in both ANUP patients (in colony forming unit percent of total CFU recovered) (CFU %) revealed the presence of P. intermedia (ANUP1, 41.7 CFU %; ANUP2, 14.8 CFU %), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ANUP1, 3.6 CFU %; ANUP2, 48.1 CFU %), and Veillonella spp. (ANUP1, 18.2 CFU %; ANUP2, 18.5 CFU %). Spirochetes were also observed in cytocentrifuged, Gram-stained plaque from both ANUP patients. The predominant Gram-positive bacterial species recovered from both NUG1 and NUG2 was Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - Flow-cytometric identification and detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis by a LPS specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) by flow cytometry (FCM) using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) OMR-Bg1E directed to P. gingivalis-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The P. gingivalis strains ATCC 33277, 381, ESO75, W50, and A7A1 were selected for the study. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia), Campylobacter rectus (C. rectus), Streptococcus sanguis (S. sanguis) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) served as controls. A suspension of 10(7) bacteria/ml of each bacteria was prepared and then reacted with a P. gingivalis specific MAb OMR-Bg1E and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled second antibody. These samples were analyzed by FCM. Bacterial specific binding aggregate on data was separated out by the forward- and side-angle-scatter characteristics, while non-specific binding (NSB) was eliminated by excluding the region with mouse IgG-positive and second antibody-positive area. FCM detected a mean range of 56.2% to 97.2% P. gingivalis strains. There was a 5.1% non-specific binding using FCM to non-P. gingivalis strains. When the P. gingivalis concentration was adjusted to 10(2), 10(4), and 10(6) bacteria/ml, a detection rate of 35.7%, 48.1%, and 91.4%, was respectively observed. The lower sensitivity of the flow cytometric assay was 10(2) bacteria/ml. When P. gingivalis was added to P. intermedia suspension at 1, 20, 40, 60, and 80%, the MAb-positive fraction yielded by FCM displayed a coefficient of determination of 0.967 with the actual percentage of P. gingivalis and could be regressed to a linear function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes in saliva and subgingival samples taken from young women.
AB  - Stimulated saliva and a pooled subgingival sample from the first molars were collected from 30 Caucasian women (mean age 30 years) for the presence of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. The samples were inoculated on nonselective and selective media. The gram-negative anaerobic species occurring in the oral cavity of more than 50% of the subjects were selected for further analysis. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella melaninogenica were not recovered from subgingival sites without a simultaneous recovery in saliva. When positive subgingivally, Leptotrichia spp., nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacteroides gracilis and Prevotella loescheii were simultaneously detected from saliva in 76%, 72%, 64%, 64%, 61% and 55% of the subjects, respectively. Intraindividually, the proportions of F. nucleatum, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Leptotrichia spp., B. gracilis and P. loescheii of the anaerobic flora were quite similar in the salivary and subgingival samples. Capnocytophaga spp. and P. intermedia were present in higher proportions in subgingival samples than in saliva, whereas P. melaningogenica was present in higher proportions in saliva. Our data indicate that many oral gram-negative anaerobes are frequently recovered from stimulated saliva. Furthermore, when subgingivally positive, most subjects harbored these anaerobes simultaneously in saliva.
TI  - Macaca fascicularis as a model in which to assess the safety and efficacy of a vaccine for periodontitis.
AB  - We have assessed Macaca fascicularis as a potential model in which to test the efficacy and safety of a vaccine for periodontitis. Twenty-eight animals were surveyed and 20 studied in more detail. Clinical periodontal status was assessed, the subgingival microflora analyzed especially for the presence and proportions of Porphyromonas gingivalis and titers and avidities of serum antibodies reactive with P. gingivalis measured. Probing depths ranged from 0.90 mm to 3.80 mm, Gingival Index scores from 0.00 to 4.00 and Plaque Index scores from 0.00 to 3.00. About 40% of sites bled on probing. The animals manifested a subgingival flora characteristic of the anaerobic gram-negative bacteria found in human periodontal pockets, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. P. gingivalis was detected in 70 of 80 samples studied, ranging from 0.01% to 20% of the total flora. Serum antibody reactive with antigens of P. gingivalis was observed in all animals, with titers ranging from 1.0 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) unit to 25 ELISA units and avidities from 0.10 M to 2.20 M. Antibody titer and maximum percentage of P. gingivalis were inversely correlated, indicating that a humoral immune response may be effective in reducing P. gingivalis overgrowth. M. fascicularis appears to be an excellent model for use in vaccine development.
TI  - Adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. The purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different GTR membranes. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the test membranes. In part I of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. Six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part II of this study. The membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37 degrees C. Membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls. At 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (RTF) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. Each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml RTF to detach adherent bacteria. The detached adherent bacteria were counted using a Petroff-Hausser chamber. Data were analyzed by using the SAS program. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. Results showed S. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. Selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. Polyglactin 910 had significantly (P < 0.05) lower S. mutants adherence than either the ePTFE or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  - To investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). Clinical measurements were recorded at the Ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. In addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (LA) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. Microbiological samples were taken from one of the Ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal LA), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with LA, and from the saliva. The samples were analyzed for the presence of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. Furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. It is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. Among the periodontal pathogens, only P. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal LA (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). This finding was irrespective of the secretor status. Therefore, P. intermedia may be an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Demonstration of human immunoglobulin G Fc-binding activity in oral bacteria.
AB  - Nonimmune binding of immunoglobulins via the Fc fragment may reduce opsonization  and phagocytosis of bacteria and is thus considered a virulence factor. The aim of this study was to investigate a wide range of oral bacterial strains for the presence of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-binding activity. A total of 132 strains representing 40 different gram-positive and gram negative bacterial species were tested for IgG Fc-binding activity by using a fast and simple dot blot procedure with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Fc fragments from human IgG. Neither the human nor animal biotype of Porphyromonas gingivalis possessed IgG Fc-binding activity. The strongest positive reaction of gram-negative species with the IgG Fc fragments were obtained with strains of Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Among the gram-positive bacteria tested, Peptostreptococcus micros, Lactobacillus spp., and several species of streptococci possessed IgG Fc-binding activity. In the present investigation, the ability of several oral bacterial species to bind IgG Fc fragments was demonstrated. This factor represents a potential virulence determinant as it may help pathogenic oral bacteria escape host defense mechanisms.
TI  - Similarities between Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacteroides fragilis studied by  two DNA probes derived from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified oligonucleotide DNA probe corresponding to a Fusobacterium nucleatum Fevl DNA region coding for a 40-kDa major outer-membrane protein (OMP) and a randomly cloned 2.1 kb DNA probe were found to recognize DNA from the Gram-negative bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis on Southern blots and slot blots. The results indicate sequence similarity within the DNA fragments studied. Immunoblots tested with polyclonal antibodies against whole cells of F. nucleatum revealed only weak antigen similarity between these species.
TI  - Microbiology of tonsillar surfaces in infectious mononucleosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the cultures of tonsillar surface aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora taken during the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis with the repeated cultures taken 2 months later. PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with pharyngotonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. RESULTS: A total of 121 bacterial isolates (ie, 84 anaerobes and 37 facultatives and aerobes) were isolated in the acute stage, and 75 isolates (ie, 42 anaerobes and 33 aerobes) were recovered 2 months later. The reduction in the number of organisms in the second specimen was mostly due to the decrease in the recovery of Prevotella intermedia (13 in the first culture, compared with four in the second) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (12 vs four, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The study illustrates that the surfaces of tonsils of patients with infectious mononucleosis contain more species of anaerobic organisms during the illness than following it. The potential role of these organisms in the inflammation process warrants further study.
TI  - Use of the Syrian golden hamster for the induction of intraoral abscesses by sutures contaminated with human subgingival plaque.
AB  - Analysis of normal oral flora in 150 cheek pouches of hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) defined the microbial working environment and demonstrated the absence of human oral black-pigmented bacteria. Silk sutures saturated with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia or subgingival plaque were used to close wounds made in hamster's cheek pouches. Abscesses were formed when sutures had solitary P. gingivalis or other bacteria mixed with P. gingivalis or when P. intermedia was mixed with other bacteria besides P. gingivalis. A concentration of black-pigmented bacteria emanating from 3 x 10(5) colony-forming units/inoculum was required for abscess formation. Six abscesses (14.3%) were developed in association with the presence of other odontopathic bacteria, primarily Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus. The hamster cheek pouch with iatrogenic wounds closed with plaque-impregnated sutures is a novel and effective model to study the pathology of wound infections and virulence of human subgingival organisms.
TI  - Modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  - A cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. Clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. A statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. When only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. Tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. Tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. As percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, E. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting Prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. The addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2 to 33%. When immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. IgG antibody levels to P. gingivalis W83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) A. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. Anti-F. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. A total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. When clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to P. gingivalis W83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of B-lymphocytes (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-E. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-P. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. The number of enteric bacteria, anti-F. nucleatum levels, and anti-P. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. The r2 for this model was 75%. These results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.
TI  - Detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. The elimination of P. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. Therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on P. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. We have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of P. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. In this study we determined the proportions of P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga spp, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. P. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (P values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. Testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of P. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. The amidolytic activity of Treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of Capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). The outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of P. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - A quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  - The levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. The numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. Selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries, but not from root surface caries. The proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. In root surface caries, Actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. The proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. Immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.
TI  - Positive and negative associations between bacterial species in dental root canals.
AB  - Significant associations have been previously reported between certain pairs of bacterial species isolated from human dental root canals. The aim of this study was to examine microbiologically a more extensive series of cases, with particular reference to obligate anaerobes which accounted for 64% of total isolations. A total of 65 different species was isolated and individual root canals yielded a maximum of eleven bacterial species. Highly significant positive associations (p < 0.001) were found between Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp., between Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. melaninogenica, between P. micros and Prevotella spp., P. micros and P. melaninogenica and between Prevotella spp. and Eubacterium spp., all with an ODDS ratio of > 9.0. In contrast, negative and highly significant associations (p < 0.01) were found only between the four species pairs: B. vulgatus/F. necrophorum, P. magnus/Bifidobacterium spp., B. gracilis/F. nucleatum and between B. gracilis/Fusobacterium spp.; all with an ODDS ratio of < 0.5. Some previously published associations were confirmed and some new associations were found, while some negative associations became apparent.
TI  - DNA probe detection of periodontopathogens in advanced periodontitis.
AB  - Species-specific DNA probes were used to determine the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Wolinella recta in subgingival plaque from deep pockets/sites of patients with advanced periodontitis. The subjects were 20 patients with severe adult periodontitis, 13 men and 7 women (mean age 45.6 +/- 6.7 yr). For each subject, 9-10 subgingival sites with the deepest probing depths from each quadrant were sampled by the paper point method, a total of 198 sites, with mean probing depth 7.2 +/- 1.6 mm and clinical attachment level 9.5 +/- 2.7 mm. A.a. was present in at least one site in 75% of the subjects; P. gingivalis was found in 95%; P. intermedia and W. recta were found in 90%, respectively; and T. denticola, E. corrodens, and F. nucleatum were found in all subjects. In the 198 samples, A.a. was detected in 25.8%, P. gingivalis in 51.5%, P. intermedia in 64.1%, T. denticola in 60.6%, E. corrodens in 72.9%, F. nucleatum in 74.7%, and W. recta in 65.7%. The predominant combination was the simultaneous presence of P. intermedia, T. denticola, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and W. recta in 89.5% of the subjects and 46.8% of the sites. Of these sites, 51.1% showed the combined presence of P. gingivalis and 28.4% that of both A.a. and P. gingivalis. None of the seven bacteria could be detected in 14.4% of the total sites sampled. The present study indicates that severe destructive adult periodontitis is a multibacterial infection and that certain combinations of periodontopathogens seem to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.
TI  - A comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  - This study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in VMGA or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. Sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. The samples transported in VMGA III showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. This was explained by the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of VMGA III, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. In a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.
TI  - Association between cigarette smoking, bacterial pathogens, and periodontal status.
AB  - The purposes of this study were to determine if: 1) an association exists between cigarette smoking and signs of periodontal disease after controlling for the confounding variables of age, sex, plaque, and calculus; 2) the prevalence of 5 bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease differs between smokers and non-smokers; and 3) the presence of any of these bacteria or smoking are associated with a mean proximal posterior probing depth > or = 3.5 mm. Plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and probing depth were measured at the proximal surfaces of all teeth in one randomly selected posterior dental sextant in 615 adults. Subgingival plaque was sampled from the same sites and assayed for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. A subsample of non-smokers (n = 126), who were similar to smokers (n = 63) with respect to age, sex, plaque, and calculus, was randomly drawn from the original sample. These two groups were then compared on the basis of clinical and microbial parameters. The results indicated that the odds of having a mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm were 5 times greater for smokers than the non-smoker subsample (odds ratio = 5.3; 95% CI = 2.0 to 13.8). No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any of the bacteria was found between smokers and the non-smoker subsample. Based on logistic regression analyses of each of the 5 bacteria and smoking, mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm was significantly associated with the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, E. corrodens, and smoking (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antiseptic mouthrinse-induced microbial cell surface alterations.
AB  - This study determined the effect of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse, Listerine Antiseptic, on microbial cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. Twenty-four hour cultures of C. albicans, A. viscosus, S. sanguis, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were harvested and washed in buffer. Triplicate samples were overlaid on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips, immersed in either Listerine or buffer for 30 seconds, fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Peldri II. Exposure of the microorganisms to Listerine Antiseptic for 30 seconds resulted in distinct morphological alterations of cell surfaces suggestive of loss of cell surface integrity. The extent of alteration varied among the structurally different species; cell surface roughening was mild in S. sanguis but extensive in the other microorganisms which developed distinct surface blebs and other abnormalities after the 30-second exposure. These results suggest that a brief exposure to Listerine produces significant morphological changes which may be associated with cell death and may help explain the alteration of surface-associated activities demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  - Fusobacteria: new taxonomy and related diseases.
AB  - Fusobacteria are anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Since the first reports in the  late nineteenth century, various names have been applied to these organisms, sometimes with the same name being applied to different species. More recently, not only have there been changes to the nomenclature, but also attempts to differentiate between species which are believed to be either pathogenic or commensal or both. Because of their asaccharolytic nature, and a general paucity of positive results in routine biochemical tests, laboratory identification of the fusobacteria has been difficult. However, the application of novel molecular biological techniques to taxonomy has established a number of new species, together with the subspeciation of Fusobacterium necrophorum and F. nucleatum, and provided new methods for identification. The involvement of fusobacteria in a wide spectrum of human infections causing tissue necrosis and septicaemia has long been recognised, and, more recently, their importance in intra-amniotic infections, premature labour and tropical ulcers has been reported.
TI  - PRB3 null mutations result in absence of the proline-rich glycoprotein Gl and abolish Fusobacterium nucleatum interactions with saliva in vitro.
AB  - The glycosylated proline-rich glycoprotein (Gl or PRG), a product of the PRB3 gene, is a major constituent of human parotid saliva. Important functions proposed for Gl include acting as a bacterial receptor. The Gl proteins of several subjects were typed by two polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) systems: acid-lactate PAGE followed by staining with the periodic acid-Schiff reagent and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer and staining with amido black or concanavalin A. The results showed one subject who apparently lacked Gl. The four exons, including splice junctions, for both PRB3 alleles of this subject were completely sequenced. Unexpressed (null) mutations were detected with an identical C nucleotide insertion in the same coding region of exon 3 of both alleles. This C nucleotide insertion leads to a frameshift with a premature termination codon that probably results in markedly reduced or absent PRB3 gene expression. We then used a nitrocellulose blot overlay assay to assay the bacterial receptor activity of parotid saliva from the PRB3null subject. No interactions with Fusobacterium nucleatum, shown previously to interact selectively with Gl, were detected. Together, these results suggest that this subject does not express the PRB3 gene and that one of the consequences is an altered ability to interact with a bacterium known to colonize the oral cavity.
TI  - Late onset Papillon-Lefevre syndrome? A chromosomic, neutrophil function and microbiological study.
AB  - We had the opportunity to study a family with one of the most destructive forms of periodontal disease known, the Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. The parents had no consanguinity and were not affected, and were therefore to be considered carriers of the disease. 2 sisters, the eldest and youngest, showed periodontal breakdown and hyperkeratotic skin lesions, but their deciduous dentition was not affected. 2 brothers had skin lesions only and another brother and sister were healthy. Furthermore, 2 babies died at birth one after a 9-month pregnancy and the other after a 6-month pregnancy, and the mother also suffered 3 miscarriages. For 4 years, we studied the family: in the case of both sisters, mechanical periodontal treatment and antibiotics were unable to control the disease. In the chromosomic study of the 2 sisters affected, the GTG banding technique found no trace of anomalies in the cells analyzed, whose chromosomic formation was 46,XX. Before treatment, the chemotaxis of the PMN, the phagocytosis of opsonized Staphylococcus aureus, and production of superoxide radicals by PMN was significantly impaired in both sisters. Despite scaling and root planing, the periodontal lesions still progressed, but the PMN functions evaluated were now normal in both sisters. An orally asymptomatic but dermatologically affected brother showed no significant defect in the phagocytic activity and the production of superoxide radicals.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of various endodontic medicaments on selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the antibacterial effects of various endodontic medicaments against six selected anaerobic bacteria. The experiment involved the testing of the vapors of six medicaments using agar plates streaked with the bacteria. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analyzed statistically. Formocresol produced significantly larger zones of inhibition than any of the other medicaments.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
TI  - Complete sequence of omp1, the structural gene encoding the 40-kDa outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum strain Fev1.
AB  - The sequence of the omp1 gene coding for the 40-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP)  of the Gram- oral bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum strain Fev1, has been determined. Degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers were used to prime the amplification of a 120-mer sequence of the gene. This sequence was successively used for constructing new primers applied in asymmetrical, symmetrical, and inverse polymerase chain reaction using as template genomic DNA, self-ligated DNA fragments, or fragments ligated into either pGEM-7Zf+ or pACYC184. The codon usage of the gene was unusual in that A or T was used as the third base in the codon triplets in all cases, except for those amino acids (aa) which have only one or two possible codon choices. Only 35 of the 61 sense codons were used. The aa sequence of the protein was deduced; it consisted of 348 aa (M(r) 39,954), which is in good agreement with the 40-kDa size estimated from electrophoretic analyses. The mature protein was preceded by a 20-aa signal peptide.
TI  - An in vivo study of the influence of the surface roughness of implants on the microbiology of supra- and subgingival plaque.
AB  - In nine patients with fixed prostheses supported by endosseous titanium implants, 2 titanium abutments (transmucosal part of the implant) were replaced by either an unused standard abutment or a roughened titanium abutment. After 3 months of habitual oral hygiene, plaque samples were taken for differential phase-contrast microscopy, DNA probe analysis, and culturing. Supragingivally, rough abutments harbored significantly fewer coccoid micro-organisms (64 vs. 81%), which is indicative of a more mature plaque. Subgingivally, the observations depended on the sampling procedure. For plaque collected with paper points, only minor qualitative and quantitative differences between both substrata could be registered. However, when the microbiota adhering to the abutment were considered, rough surfaces harbored 25 times more bacteria, with a slightly lower density of coccoid organisms. The presence and density of periodontal pathogens subgingivally were, however, more related to the patient's dental status than to the surface characteristics of the abutments. These results justify the search for optimal surface smoothness for all intra-oral and intra-sulcular hard surfaces for reduction of bacterial colonization and of periodontal pathogens.
TI  - [Cytotoxicity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected root canal].
AB  - Bacteria in the infected root canal play an important role in the progression of  the periapical lesion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of bacteria isolated from an infected root canal on the periapical lesion. Four obligately anaerobic bacteria were isolated and their sonic extracts (SE) were prepared. The cytotoxic assay of each SE for MC3T3-E1 cell was used with respect to the morphological cell changes and [3H]-thymidine uptake. The following results were obtained: 1. Four obligately anaerobic bacteria were identified as follows: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (P. a.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.), Eubacterium lentum (E. l.), and Peptostreptococcus micros (P. m.). 2. The protein concentrations which induced the morphological cell changes differed in each SE. The SE from P. m. caused cell abnormalities at 10 micrograms protein/ml, F. n. and E. l., at 30 micrograms protein/ml, and P. a., at 100 micrograms protein/ml. 3. The inhibition of the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA was concentration-dependent. The SE of P. a. showed less cytotoxicity than the others at lower concentrations; 3, 10, 30 micrograms protein/ml. The SE from F. n. had more cytotoxicity at higher concentrations; 100, 300 micrograms protein/ml. These results suggest that these bacterial sonic extracts have a potential to cause morphological cell changes and inhibit the cell proliferation in different concentrations.
TI  - Microbial colonization of dental implants in partially edentulous subjects.
AB  - This study assessed the colonization of Branemark dental implants by periodontopathic bacteria in four partially edentulous patients with a total of 10 implants. Marginal and subgingival plaque on the implants was sampled 14 days and 28 days after second-stage surgery and compared with plaque from three teeth closest to the implant sites sampled before second-stage surgery (baseline) and at 14 and 28 days. Slot immunoblot assay was used to determine the presence or absence of bacterial antigen to six different periodontopathic microorganisms. In general, colonization of marginal implant plaque occurred within 14 days, whereas subgingival colonization took longer and occurred within 28 days. It appears that Branemark dental implants placed in partially edentulous patients may be colonized by disease-associated bacteria within 14 days of second-stage surgery.
TI  - Role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  - Periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. Although a specificity to some degree is found for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. What we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. This hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. Some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. Microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in LJP patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. Suspected pathogens (risk markers) are Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroidesforsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. The presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and AIDS--or with implants.
TI  - Microbial associations in periodontitis sites before and after treatment.
AB  - Duplicate samples from 110 periodontal sites of 6 mm or more pocket depth in 16 patients were analyzed for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp., Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The sites were sampled before and after nonsurgical periodontal treatment. No statistically significant associations were found before treatment between any of the analyzed species. After treatment, statistically significant associations were found between E. corrodens and all the other species, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia; Capnocytophaga spp. and C. rectus; P. intermedia vs Capnocytophaga spp. and P. gingivalis; and C. rectus vs Capnocytophaga spp. and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Some of these associations could be explained either by patient-related factors or site-related characteristics such as the pocket depth. The proportion of P. gingivalis seemed to be unrelated to the proportion of P. intermedia in the samples. If one of the analyzed microbes was found in one of the sampled pockets in a patient, the probability of finding that microbe in all the sampled sites in the same patient before treatment was more than 50%. This probability was reduced after treatment for many species, especially P. gingivalis, which showed a probability of zero. The probability of detecting a bacterial species on at least one additional site if it was present on one in the same individual was nearly 100%, both before and after treatment, for all species studied. This study has shown several potential microbial associations in the subgingival plaque flora of deep periodontal pockets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Macaca nemestrina: a non-human primate model for studies of periodontal disease.
AB  - The non-human primate Macaca nemestrina was evaluated for use as a potential model in periodontal research by study of 16 animals. Using one incisor, premolar, and molar per quadrant, we measured supragingival plaque, severity of gingival inflammation, and pocket depth, and analyzed the subgingival flora. Serum IgG titers and avidities to antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) were also assessed. Ten animals were between 13 and 24 years old, and six were between 4 and 5 years old. While mean gingival inflammation scores were significantly higher for older than for younger animals (2.2 vs 1.8, p < 0.05), mean plaque index scores and mean probing depths did not differ significantly. The animals harbored a subgingival microflora considered to be pathogenic for humans including Aa, Pg, Bacteroides forsythus, Prevotella intermedia I and II, Campylobacter recta and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Aa, however, was found only in the younger animals. All of the animals had serum IgG antibodies reactive with antigens of Pg and Aa, and titers for Pg but not for Aa were significantly higher in the older relative to the younger animals (t test p < 0.02). In contrast, antibody avidity did not significantly differ between the two groups. A combined clinical assessment index based on maximum probing depth, gingival index score, and tooth loss was used to assess the overall disease severity. Titers were positively associated with disease severity (Spearman's rank correlation 0.57, p = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of antibiotic treatment on clinical conditions and bacterial growth with  guided tissue regeneration.
AB  - Mucogingival flaps were reflected over pairs of mandibular molar teeth with Class II furcation invasions. The dimensions of the furcations were measured. The teeth were debrided and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) membrane was placed and retained over one furcation of each pair (test site) for 4 weeks. The second site served as a control. Eight patients (group 1) with 12 e-PTFE sites received no antibiotic. Seven patients (group 2) with 12 e-PTFE sites were administered amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium for 10 days. Paper-points were used to collect bacterial samples and clinical indices were recorded at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks. Paper-point samples and the e-PTFE collected at week 4 were sonicated and analyzed by DNA probes for seven putative pathogens. At baseline no parameter showed statistical differences between groups or sites. At week 1 significantly greater levels of Prevotella intermedia type I (P < 0.05) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (P < 0.01) were found in group 1. At week 4, paper-point samples from test sites (P < 0.05) and e-PTFE materials (P < 0.001) showed significantly higher presence of Bacteroides forsythus in group 1. No significant microbial changes were found for control sites over time or between groups. The total bacterial load at test sites over time increased similarly for patients administered or not administered the antibiotic. Clinical signs of inflammation were significantly greater in group 1 and associated with the presence of B. forsythus (P < 0.01).

TI  - Measurement of electrical bioimpedance for studying utilization of amino acids and peptides by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola.
AB  - The growth response of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola to peptides (supplied as trypticase) and amino acids (supplied as casamino acids) was measured over 24 hours by monitoring changes in alternating-current conductivity at 37 degrees C. All species utilized peptides preferentially over amino acids. These results are consistent with those obtained previously with conventional growth-response experiments. The duration of the linear growth response to trypticase of P. gingivalis was 9.7 hours, whereas that of both F. nucleatum and T. denticola was > 24 hours. By contrast, there was more uniformity in the utilization of amino acids from the casamino acid mixture, which previously has been shown to be a poor growth substrate. Furthermore, subtle differences in growth patterns, such as the ability of F. nucleatum to metabolize its storage glycopolymers before utilizing amino acids, were clearly evident. The present method provides an excellent means of studying bacterial growth kinetics and delineating bacterial/substrate specificities of both synthetic and natural substrates.
TI  - Investigating the source of amniotic fluid isolates of fusobacteria.
AB  
TI  - Tetracycline resistance in periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial agents are used in combination with debridement to eliminate putative periodontal pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, from diseased tissues. The most frequently used antimicrobial agents are the tetracyclines. However, these agents are not effective in some patients. This lack of efficacy may be due to antimicrobial resistance. As many as 75% of the bacteria in the subgingival flora may be resistant to tetracycline after long-term, low-dose treatment. Tetracycline resistance is mediated by the tet(M) determinant in some isolates of Veillonella species and Fusobacterium nucleatum, while a DNA probe to the tet(Q) determinant hybridizes to isolates of Prevotella denticola and P. intermedia. The mechanism of tetracycline resistance for most periodontal organisms, however, has yet to be determined. Before tetracycline is used as adjunctive therapy for refractory periodontitis, the subgingival bacterial flora should be tested for susceptibility.
TI  - Oral and dental infections with anaerobic bacteria: clinical features, predominant pathogens, and treatment.
AB  - Microbial populations colonizing the teeth are a major source of pathogens responsible for oral and dental infections, including periodontal diseases, gingivitis, pericoronitis, endodontitis, peri-implantitis, and postextraction infections. Each entity has distinct clinical and microbial features. Bacterial species associated with oral infections include Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Treponema pallidum-related spirochetes have been associated with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. Porphyromonas endodontalis appears to be specifically related to endodontic infections. Oral infections in medically compromised patients, including those with AIDS, are associated with similar species and are usually complicated by superinfection with enteric and Candida species. Isolation of species causing oral infections requires the collection of appropriate samples and the use of strictly anaerobic techniques. Rapid selective culture, immunofluorescence, and DNA probe methods have been developed for the identification of these oral species. The varied measures required in the management of oral and dental infections may include antimicrobial therapy. Accurate microbiological diagnosis, including antibiotic susceptibility testing, is indicated for cases that do not respond to therapy.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  - Peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. On occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or to the mediastinum. We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal abscess yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. The patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. This case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that this infection may lead to.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  - Aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. Of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). Aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases and together with anaerobes in 87. The most common aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), Streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). Anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, Prevotella intermedia from 32%, Peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, Fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and Actinomyces odontolyticus from 23%. The rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with S. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with F. necrophorum (P < .01). Recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with F. necrophorum than among those infected with S. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; P < .0001) or with S. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; P < .05). beta-Lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of Prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients studied harbored one or more such strains.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - Bacteriology of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections: preliminary report.
AB  - A retrospective bacteriologic study of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections diagnosed at the Wadsworth Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 1976 and 1991 was performed. There were 116 specimens from 110 patients. Available strains were reexamined using the latest tests and taxonomic schemes. Pleural fluid was believed to provide the most reliable specimen; cultures yielded an average of 3.0 anaerobes and 0.6 nonanaerobes per specimen. The most commonly encountered anaerobes were pigmented Prevotella species, nonpigmented Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus species, and Bacteroides species. Thirty percent of the anaerobic gram-negative rods were beta-lactamase producers.
TI  - Stimulation of B lymphocytes by lipopolysaccharides from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, including those of low endotoxic activity that are isolated from Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas are potent inducers of DNA replication and polyclonal immunoglobulin production in murine B lymphocytes. The activation is dose-dependent and T cell-independent. Replication of DNA and production of immunoglobulins were also stimulated by lipid A and by the LPS heteropolysaccharide that were isolated by mild acid hydrolysis of the LPSs of Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Combinations of LPS, lipid A, and acid-degraded polysaccharide amplified the blastogenic response. Antibodies that react with the polysaccharide part of LPSs isolated from members of the Bacteroidaceae are present in healthy human serum.
TI  - New findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'Streptococcus milleri'-group, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, P. intermedia, P. oralis and unidentified Prevotella spp. Two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas Prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. The large proportion of non-pigmented Prevotella species, P. asaccharolytica and B. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. The role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'Streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Sensitization of periodontopathogenic bacteria to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  - Cultures of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans were treated with a range of photosensitizers and then exposed to light from a 7.3 mW helium/neon laser for up to 80 s. Toluidine blue O (25 micrograms/ml) and methylene blue (25 micrograms/ml) were effective lethal photosensitizers of all 3 target organisms, enabling substantial light dose-related reductions in viable counts. Dihaematoporphyrin ester and aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine were lethal photosensitizers only of P. gingivalis. In the absence of a photosensitizer, exposure to laser light had no significant effect on the viability of the cultures. If such low doses of light (22 J/cm2) are effective at killing bacteria in vivo, the technique may be useful as a means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from diseased sites.
TI  - Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguis during experimental gingivitis in young adults.
AB  - Twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies against whole cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean serum immunoglobulin G antibody levels to P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and S. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin G antibodies to P. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. This reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to variations in oral hygiene. These people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin G responses to P. gingivalis than people who developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. The variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - The effect of subgingival debridement on periodontal disease parameters and the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to analyse the effect of subgingival scaling and root planing in subjects who prior to treatment exercised meticulous supragingival plaque control. 300 subjects were examined at baseline and after 1 and 2 years without treatment. After the year 2 examination, 62 subjects were randomly selected for therapy. They were given detailed instruction in proper self-performed toothcleaning measures and were carefully monitored during the subsequent 2 years. Following the year-4 examination, 2 quadrants, 1 maxillary and 1 mandibular in each subject, were randomly selected for additional therapy. The teeth in the selected quadrants were exposed to subgingival scaling and root planing. The subgingival therapy was repeated until a site no longer bled on gentle probing. This basic therapy was completed within a 2-month period. All subjects were re-examined after another 12-month interval. The examinations at year 4 and 5 included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and analysis of samples obtained from the subgingival microbiota at 134 selected sites. The findings from the present study demonstrated: (i) that subgingival scaling and root planing were effective in eliminating subgingival plaque and gingivitis; (ii) that professional therapy resulted in a pronounced reduction of probing depth at sites which at year 4 had a probing depth > 3 mm; (iii) that in non-scaled quadrants, the extension of self-performed plaque control resulted in a continued improvement of the periodontal conditions at sites which at year 4 were < 5 mm deep.
TI  - Enzyme activity in crevicular fluid in relation to metabolic control of diabetes  and other periodontal risk factors.
AB  - Diabetics are generally considered at higher risk for periodontitis than non-diabetics. Among diabetics, those with poorer metabolic control have often been found to have more periodontitis. This study investigated the relationship between two crevicular fluid enzymes, beta-glucuronidase (beta G) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and metabolic control in 93 adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Metabolic control was evaluated by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The most visibly inflamed site was sampled for crevicular fluid enzymes and plaque for microbial assessment. Plaque, calculus, and probing depth were also recorded. Beta-glucuronidase was found at significantly higher levels in patients with poorer diabetic control while LDH levels were not related to control. Using multiple regression analysis, good metabolic control was the only predicting variable for beta-glucuronidase when considered with microbes, probing depth, plaque, calculus, age, duration, and type of diabetes. If beta-glucuronidase is a predictor of periodontal disease activity, diabetics with poor metabolic control are at higher risk for periodontitis.
TI  - Lethal photosensitization of bacteria in subgingival plaque from patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were exposed  to light from a 7.3 mW Helium/Neon laser for 30 s in the presence and absence of 50 micrograms/ml toluidine blue O as a photosensitizer. Viable counts of various groups and species of bacteria were carried out before and after irradiation. The median numbers of viable bacteria initially present in the 30-microliters aliquots irradiated were 1.13 x 10(5) cfu (aerobes), 4.08 x 10(5) cfu (anaerobes), 4.92 x 10(3) cfu (black-pigmented anaerobes), 4.75 x 10(2) cfu (Porphyromonas gingivalis), 6.15 x 10(3) cfu (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and 1.7 x 10(4) cfu (streptococci). The dye/laser combination achieved significant reductions in the viability of these organisms, the median reductions in the viable counts being 91.1% for aerobes, 96.6% for anaerobes, 100% for black-pigmented anaerobes, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum and 94.2% for streptococci. Overall, the viability of bacteria in the 20 plaque samples was not significantly decreased by the dye alone. However, in a small minority of samples there were indications of light-independent, dye-induced toxicity. Low-power lasers, in conjunction with appropriate photosensitizers, may be a useful adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases if a similar effectiveness against subgingival plaque bacteria can be achieved in vivo.
TI  - Aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium OMIZ-W1. None of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas sputigena, Treponema pectinovorum, T. socranskii, or Wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methylester). Phenylalanine was essential for the growth of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium timidum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. With the exception of E. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.
TI  - The influence of race and gender on periodontal microflora.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that demographic characteristics of subject populations influence both the incidence of periodontal diseases and various aspects of host responses to periodontal bacteria. In this study we analyzed the components of the subgingival microflora from individuals with adult periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, gingivitis, and periodontal health as a function of gender and race (black and white). Clinical categories were analyzed individually so that there were no differences in the clinical characteristics of the sampled sites. No significant differences were noted in the subgingival microflora between males and females. When either the first two bacterial samples from each subject or all bacterial samples taken from each subject were included in the analysis, it was found that Porphyromonas gingivalis was more significantly associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group. When all samples were considered in the analysis, it was found that Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group, while Fusobacterium nucleatum was associated with white subjects in both the adult periodontitis and early onset periodontitis groups. Thus a limited number of important bacterial components of the subgingival microflora are influenced by the race and diagnosis of the subject group.
TI  - Pyomyositis and septic arthritis from Fusobacterium nucleatum in a nonimmunocompromised adult.
AB  - We describe a case of pyomyositis of the quadriceps associated with septic arthritis of the knee that developed after Fusobacterium nucleatum septicemia in a healthy man. The primary foci was presumed to be the oral cavity. Pyomyositis from Fusobacterium nucleatum is uncommon, and to our knowledge its association with septic arthritis has not been described.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction-amplified nonradioactive probes for identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction probe with 100% sequence identity to 120 deoxyribonucleotides of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1, coding for a part of the 40-kDa major outer membrane protein, was labeled with the steroid hapten digoxigenin. The probe was compared with various degenerate oligonucleotide probes and found to tolerate much more stringent washing conditions. It was therefore superior in distinguishing, by means of Southern blots and slot blots, F. nucleatum from other oral gram-negative bacteria in the periodontal pocket and from other fusobacterial species and in distinguishing among different strains of F. nucleatum. F. periodonticum was found to be more similar to F. nucleatum than the other fusobacterial species tested.
TI  - A 6-month home usage trial of a 1% chlorhexidine toothpaste (II). Effects on the  oral microflora.
AB  - The effects of 1% chlorhexidine and 1% chlorhexidine/fluoride dentifrices on supragingival plaque flora were investigated in a 6-month home-usage study. 146 subjects were studied from whom plaque around 6 teeth was collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks. Total anaerobic counts were reduced at 6 and 24 weeks in both active groups compared to control. No differences were seen in any other bacterial parameters. There was a significant decrease in the susceptibility to chlorhexidine of bacteria recovered from the subjects on the active treatments compared to control but, since the magnitude of effect was less than one dilution, this was not thought to be of any clinical significance.
TI  - Interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and transforming growth factor-beta production by human gingival mononuclear cells following stimulation with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Gingival mononuclear cell production of interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) after stimulation with the putative periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum was investigated. Using an ELISA method, gingival mononuclear cells extracted from 18 adult periodontitis subjects were found to be producing IL-1. However, IL-1 activity could only be detected in 5 out of these 18 cases when tested using a thymocyte proliferation bio-assay, suggesting the presence of IL-1 inhibitors. Depletion of monocytes from peripheral blood cultures resulted in a significant decrease in IL-1 activity following P. gingivalis stimulation while there was no effect in the level of IL-1 activity following stimulation with F. nucleatum. This suggests that P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum stimulate different cell types to produce IL-1. Like IL-1, IL-6 production by gingival mononuclear cells was significantly greater than that produced by the control peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Following P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum stimulation, higher levels of IL-6 could be detected; however, both organisms stimulated similar levels. Intracytoplasmic immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a lower percent TGF-beta+ cells in bacterial stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures compared with cells in medium alone. In the gingival mononuclear cell cultures, the percentage TGF-beta+ cells peaked at day 1 in F. nucleatum-stimulated, whereas in P. gingivalis-stimulated cultures the peak TGF-beta+ cells occurred at day 3, again suggesting stimulation of different cell subsets. These results illustrate that different periodontopathic bacteria may stimulate different cell types to produce cytokines which may have synergistic or antagonistic effects.
TI  - An analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. A further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. A total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 Ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. The samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. The periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. The results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for Campylobacter rectus, 80% for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for Streptococcus sanguis, 72% for Streptococcus mitis, 66% for Eikenella corrodens, 58% for Prevotella intermedia, 32% for Capnocytophaga, 27% for Selenomonas, 25% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for Porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for Streptococcus mutans. Small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring P. gingivalis, A. actinomytecomitans or > 5% P. intermedia and the rest of the sample. Similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.
TI  - Methylation of adenine and cytosine in some strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - DNA from six strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum was examined for possible methylation of adenine or cytosine in the restriction site GATC. F. nucleatum DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes Sau3AI, DpnI and MboI, subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels and Southern blotting. The blots were hybridized with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA probe. Both radioactive and non-radioactive labeling methods were used. Some strains of F. nucleatum were found to be dam methylated or dcm methylated in the sequence GATC; the adenine residue is methylated in strain ATCC 10953, while the cytosine residue is methylated in the strains F1 and F3. Strains F6, ATCC 25586 and Fev1 are probably not methylated in this nucleotide sequence.
TI  - Phagocytosis of bacterial strains isolated from acute dentoalveolar abscess.
AB  - The phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes of 37 bacterial strains identified as Streptococcus milleri (10 strains), strictly anaerobic gram-positive cocci (10) Prevotella intermedia (6), Pr. oralis (5) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (6) was investigated in vitro. The ingestion of S. milleri and strictly anaerobic gram-positive cocci was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than that of strains of Prevotella spp. and F. nucleatum. The degree of uptake of capsulate and non-capsulate strains did not differ.
TI  - Localization of the Fusobacterium nucleatum T18 adhesin activity mediating coaggregation with Porphyromonas gingivalis T22.
AB  - Adherence of pathogenic bacteria is often an essential first step in the infectious process. The ability of bacteria to adhere to one another, or to coaggregate, may be an important factor in their ability to colonize and function as pathogens in the periodontal pocket. Previously, a strong and specific coaggregation was demonstrated between two putative periodontal pathogens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The interaction appeared to be mediated by a protein adhesin on the F. nucleatum cells and a carbohydrate receptor on the P. gingivalis cells. In this investigation, we have localized the adhesin activity of F. nucleatum T18 to the outer membrane on the basis of the ability of F. nucleatum T18 vesicles to coaggregate with whole cells of P. gingivalis T22 and the ability of the outer membrane fraction of F. nucleatum T18 to inhibit coaggregation between whole cells of F. nucleatum T18 and P. gingivalis T22. Proteolytic pretreatment of the F. nucleatum T18 outer membrane fraction resulted in a loss of coaggregation inhibition, confirming the proteinaceous nature of the adhesin. The F. nucleatum T18 outer membrane fraction was found to be enriched for several proteins, including a 42-kDa major outer membrane protein which appeared to be exposed on the bacterial cell surface. Fab fragments prepared from antiserum raised to the 42-kDa outer membrane protein were found to partially but specifically block coaggregation. These data support the conclusion that the 42-kDa major outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum T18 plays a role in mediating coaggregation with P. gingivalis T22.
TI  - Sub-gingival microflora in Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  - The Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. This report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in M. mulatta monkeys. Three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. Plaque samples were obtained from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. Several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. The major microbial groups were Haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (TAC): 21-51), Peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), Actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (BPAR) (80%, 0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). Microbial groups detected less often were Wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), Capnocytophaga sp. (30%), Eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), Campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). Seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. The gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the Actinomyces sp., P. micros and BPAR; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to pre-scaling levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Purification of arginine-sensitive hemagglutinin from Fusobacterium nucleatum and its role in coaggregation.
AB  - Hemagglutinin of Fusobacterium nucleatum was extracted from Triton X-100-pronase  P-treated cell envelopes, and was purified by affinity chromatography on L-arginine agarose. The hemagglutinin was inactivated by heating at 70 degrees C for 1 min. The activity was inhibited by L-arginine but was not affected by any sugars or by EDTA. The hemagglutinin aggregated 14 out of 17 strains of oral streptococci tested, and the bacterial aggregating activity was also inhibited by L-arginine. The results indicate the dominant role of this hemagglutinin in the adherence of this bacterium both to host cells and to other bacteria.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum: case report and review of  the literature.
AB  - Endocarditis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum is exceedingly rare. We report a case of F. nucleatum right-sided endocarditis in a patient with no known intravenous drug abuse. A detailed computer and manual search of the literature using Med-Line and Index Medicus, respectively, revealed a total of five cases of endocarditis due to this species. The clinical characteristics and the patient's hospital course are summarized and reviewed.
TI  - Human monocytes and gingival fibroblasts release tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-6 in response to particulate and soluble fractions of Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - In this study we provide evidence that structural and soluble components of periodontopathogenic bacteria, such as Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum, induce the release of cytokines in vitro known to cause in vivo necrotic inflammatory phenomena and bone resorption (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-6). Human monocytes and gingival fibroblasts were cultivated in vitro in the presence of both particulate and soluble bacterial fractions. A dose-dependent production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by monocytes and gingival fibroblasts was observed in the presence of fractions of P. melaninogenica and F. nucleatum. Interleukin-1 alpha was produced in approximately the same quantities in the presence of soluble fractions of either P. melaninogenica or F. nucleatum, but in greater quantities in response to particulate fractions of P. melaninogenica. Monocytes released larger amounts of interleukin-1 alpha (about 3000 pg/ml) than gingival fibroblasts (about 1500 pg/ml). Interleukin-6 was released in greater quantities by monocytes in the presence of the pellet fraction of P. melaninogenica (about 5.5 ng/ml), but gingival fibroblasts released larger amounts of interleukin-6, especially in the presence of particulate and soluble components of F. nucleatum (about 12 ng/ml). The ability to induce the release of these cytokines notably increases the pathogenic potential of the bacteria involved in the damage of periodontal tissue.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to lipopolysaccharide of four oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease.
AB  - Periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease which erodes the supporting  structures of the teeth, and is initiated by a subgingival infection with selected Gram-negative bacteria. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of four periodontal pathogens, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis were examined for specificity and their ability to bind these pathogens in a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA). The mAb selected were specific for their homologous bacteria and when tested against a large battery of other bacteria, including 16 genera and 46 species, were found not to cross-react with heterologous species. When each of the mAb was challenged with 40 or more homologous freshly isolated bacteria, more than 90% were positive. Non-cellular antigens in the form of soluble LPS and extracellular vesicles were examined for their ability to bind to assay components and alter the apparent results of the assay. LPS was found to have potential as an interfering agent if bound to assay components prior to sample treatment, but this non-specific binding was significantly reduced when a surfactant was added to the buffers. Extracellular vesicles had no significant effect on the estimation of P. gingivalis by the assay.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (Bacteroides, gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Eikenella corrodens) and two control species (Streptococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) aqueous solution in vitro. The PVP-I solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. The strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. Based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous PVP-I for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.
TI  - Correlation between thermal sensitivity and microorganisms isolated from deep carious dentin.
AB  - The correlation between thermal sensitivity and the microorganisms present in 29  deep carious lesions was studied. The numbers of lactobacilli and total Gram-positive rods in the carious lesions were found to be negatively related to the length of pain triggered by cold and heat stimulants. The presence of Gram-positive cocci and non-black-pigmented Bacteroides were positively associated with both cold and heat sensitivities. Black-pigmented Bacteroides, Streptococcus mutans, and total anaerobic colony counts were positively related to the heat sensitivity. Recovery of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces viscosus, and enterics on the selective plates was associated with cold sensitivity. Total counts of Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods on the anaerobic nonselective medium were positively related to the cold sensitivity. It appeared that teeth with low numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded to thermal tests with longer duration of pain. Conversely, teeth with high numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded with shorter duration of pain.
TI  - Phosphorylated nutrient uptake by Treponema denticola and other potential periodontopathogens.
AB  - Nutrient uptake may contribute to the survival of certain potential periodontopathogens in the competitive environment of the gingival sulcus. This study was conducted to assess the uptake of commercially available, key radiolabelled phosphorylated compounds by Treponema denticola. There was a linear relationship in the uptake of ATP and G-1-P with cell concentrations of 0.1-2.5 mg of cell dry weight. This uptake reached a steady state within 15 min, and at temperatures of 25-37 degrees C the uptake ranged between 13-21%. At 50 degrees C, or above 50 degrees C the assay cells took up 0-1% of the assay nutrients. The maximum uptake of ATP was 47.5, 38 and 47.6 pmoles for serovars a, b and c. G-1-P yielded maximum uptake values of 306, 304, and 306 pmoles respectively. Significant uptake of ATP, or G-1-P occurred at pH 4.8 for serovars a, or c, while serovar b showed a broad pH range for the uptake of G-1-P. Stannous fluoride at a concentration of 0.17 mM enhanced the uptake of ATP while chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the uptake of ATP. At concentrations usually employed (0.05-0.5 mM) the metabolic poisons 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, sodium arsenite and the ATPase inhibitor N,N1-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not alter significantly the uptake of ATP. The uptake of ATP, by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and T. denticola at pH 4.8 was 13.4, 1.5, 6.9, and 18-20.4%, respectively. At pH 6.5 the uptake for the microorganisms indicated above was 22, 1.3, 6.6 and 6.2%, respectively. G-1-P showed the same trend in its uptake by A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and T. denticola. This study provides for the first time specific examples of phosphorylated nutrient uptake by potential periodontopathogens, and that the uptake of phosphorylated nutrients can be suppressed by oral hygienic compounds.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - Cellular fatty acids in Fusobacterium species as a tool for identification.
AB  - Identification of fusobacteria from clinical specimens currently requires analysis of metabolic end products by gas-liquid chromatography in addition to certain biochemical and enzymatic tests because of the relative biochemical inactivity of these bacteria. Even the finding of pointed, thin gram-negative cells on Gram-stained slides can no longer be relied on for identification of Fusobacterium nucleatum, since at least four other species of fusobacteria have been seen to exhibit similar morphology. We examined 46 clinical isolates and six American Type Culture Collection type strains of fusobacteria by conventional methods and by the Microbial ID Systems MIDI software package for analyzing cellular fatty acid patterns measured by capillary column gas-liquid chromatography. Distinctive patterns of major fatty acids could be used to reliably identify most clinical isolates to the species level. The MIDI system identified 89% of the isolates correctly and provides an alternative to conventional methods.
TI  - An unrecognized etiology for pyogenic hepatic abscesses in normal hosts: dental disease.
AB  - Cryptogenic pyogenic hepatic abscesses are a diagnosis of exclusion. We have identified two patients with severe dental disease at the time of the diagnosis of their liver abscess. In both cases, oral flora was cultured from the abscess. Unlike a previous report, both patients were immunocompetent. When compared with a group of patients with liver abscesses and diverticulitis, two differences were found. In contrast to the single abscesses seen in 10 of 10 patients with diverticulitis, the patients with dental disease had multiple abscesses (p < 0.02). In addition, Fusobacterium nucleatum was cultured from both dental disease associated abscesses but only one of the diverticulitis associated liver abscesses (p < 0.05). If a liver abscess is thought to be cryptogenic, a thorough dental exam is recommended.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of root canal medicaments.
AB  - The antibacterial efficacy of four endodontic medicaments was studied in vitro. Calcium hydroxide (CALACEPT), camphorated parachlorophenol (CPCP), Cresophene, and 2% iodine-potassium iodide (IKI) were tested against four anaerobic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonus gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, for 10 or 15 min. IKI was effective only against F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis, and the others were effective against all four microorganisms.
TI  - DNA probe and enzyme analysis in periodontal diagnostics.
AB  - Recent research in periodontology has indicated that a finite number of bacterial species are associated with periodontal disease. This has generated the hypothesis that periodontal disease is essentially an infection due to one or more of the putative periodontopathogens; i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis (SPH). This microbial specificity paradigm has already changed the way researchers and some clinicians view periodontal disease. The clinician must heed several cautions signs, however, if he is to use the SPH to provide treatment options that could enhance the delivery of care. There are several diagnostic technologies that can be used to detect and semi-quantitate those bacterial species that have been identified as periodontopathogens. This paper discusses diagnostic tests based upon the detection in plaque of DNA segments or enzyme activity(ies) that are unique for one or more of the suspected periodontopathogens.
TI  - Bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (BCFIA) for the detection of periodontopathogens in plaque.
AB  - A bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (BCFIA) was developed to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. The BCFIA utilized fluorescent-tagged monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected Gram-negative bacteria. Microorganisms identified in plaque using the BCFIA included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The immunoassay procedure involved combining a patient's plaque sample with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MAb and then incubating the mixture in a specialized microtiter plate allowing the MAb to bind to its homologous bacteria. Bound and unbound fluorescent-tagged MAbs were separated by filtration and total bound bacterial fluorescence was determined with a fluorimeter. The relative number of a bacterial species in a given plaque sample was estimated by reference to a standard curve carried through the BCFIA. The BCFIA had a lower detection limit of near 10(4) specific bacterial cells in a mixed bacterial preparation or plaque sample. When compared to cultivable flora procedures in detecting the 4 periodontopathogens, the BCFIA had high levels of statistical sensitivity, 97% to 100%, while statistical specificity ranged between 57% and 92%. There was a 71% to 82% agreement between BCFIA and DNA probe methodology in detecting periodontopathogens in plaque. The BCFIA, when compared to cultivable flora, offers the advantage of evaluating both live and dead bacterial cells in plaque. This may in part, if not fully, explain the lower specificity values of the BCFIA when compared to cultivable flora. Screening plaque samples for periodontopathic bacteria is considerably faster and results in a greater frequency of detection with BCFIA than cultivable flora based methods.
TI  - Development and characterization of Porphyromonas gingivalis-specific rat T-cell  clones.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen in periodontitis. To determine the role of T cells in the regulation of this disease, a method was developed for the generation and characterization of rat T-cell clones with antigen specificity to P. gingivalis whole cells. The clones studied so far demonstrated a T-helper (Th) phenotype W3/13+, W3/25+, OX8- and OX22-. These T-cell clones proliferated in vitro in response to P. gingivalis, but not to other bacteria (Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Wolinella recta, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis). Limiting dilution analysis showed W3/25+, OX8- T cells preferentially respond to P. gingivalis, rather than W3/25-, OX8+ T cells. P. gingivalis-reactive W3/25+ T cells belonged to the OX22- population, suggesting that the OX22- T cells may represent memory cells. All clones tested produced interferon gamma, but not interleukin 2. The cloned T-cell F1 significantly enhanced P. gingivalis-specific antibody production (p < 0.03). The availability of these cloned T cells should bring new insight into the mechanism by which T cells regulate oral health and periodontal disease.
TI  - Complement activation by lipopolysaccharides purified from gram-negative bacteria isolated from infected root canals.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the complement activation by  lipopolysaccharides purified from Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) endodontalis, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from infected root canals. The rate of consumption of the C3T component of the complement increased remarkably when lipopolysaccharides of more than 10 micrograms were added.
TI  - Identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  - Activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type I collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kDa trypsinlike protease from Porphyromas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), a 95-kDa chymotrypsinlike protease from Treponema denticola (ATCC 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. The bacteria included were Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25261), Prevotella buccae (ES 57), Prevotella oris (ATCC 33573), Porphyromonas endodontalis (ES 54b), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 295222), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Mitsuokella dentalis (DSM 3688), and Streptococcus mitis (ATCC 15909). None of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. The fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. The proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of TIMP-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. None of the studied bacteria, proteases from P. gingivalis and T. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. However, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. Our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. Thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal tissue destruction.
TI  - Effect of beta-lactamase inhibitors on beta-lactamases from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Three beta-lactamase inhibitors in clinical use--clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam--were investigated for their activity on beta-lactamases from Bacteroides uniformis, Clostridium butyricum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Purification of the beta-lactamases was carried out by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and FPLC. The inactivation of beta-lactamase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with nitrocefin as substrate. Various concentrations of the inhibitors were preincubated at 30 degrees C together with the enzyme for different periods of time before determination of the beta-lactamase activity. The three beta-lactamases tested were more susceptible to tazobactam than to clavulanic acid and sulbactam. Clavulanic acid and sulbactam reduced the enzyme activity of the Bacteroides uniformis beta-lactamase more effectively than the Clostridium butyricum and Fusobacterium nucleatum beta-lactamases.
TI  - Sensitization of oral bacteria in biofilms to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  - Biofilms of Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared on the surfaces of agar plates and a number of compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize bacteria in these biofilms to killing by light from a 7.3 mW Helium/Neon (He/Ne) laser. Toluidine blue O and methylene blue enabled detectable killing of all four target organisms after exposure to He/Ne light for 30 s. Aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine, haematoporphyrin HCl and haematoporphyrin ester were effective photosensitizers of only some of the target organisms. These findings suggest that lethal photosensitization may be an effective means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from dental plaque.
TI  - Characterization of shared antigens of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium  necrophorum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum are gram-negative, non-spore-forming anaerobic rods, frequently isolated from the normal flora and diseased lesions of the human oral cavity, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. F. necrophorum is also known to be an animal pathogen. Studies were undertaken with rabbit anti-F. nucleatum sera and with human adult periodontitis (AP) sera that demonstrated the sharing of antigens between the two species. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis studies of Fusobacterium species with rabbit anti-F. nucleatum sera demonstrated the presence of shared antigen(s) between F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum. Adsorption studies of AP sera in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated the presence of antibodies reacting with the shared antigens of the two species. Immunoblot (IB) analysis of a soluble protein preparation of the two species of Fusobacterium, when allowed to react with rabbit anti-F. nucleatum 10197 serum, demonstrated 53 kDa and 30 kDa bands present in members of the two species. Further, IB analysis of protein preparations of the two species with AP sera indicated the presence of antibodies reacting with the shared 53 kDa band and in some cases the 30 kDa band. During serological testing with antisera or host immune studies with human sera to these species, the presence of shared antigens must be considered.
TI  - Coaggregation studies of the Eubacterium species.
AB  - Eubacterium species are gram-positive anaerobic rods that are frequently isolated from subgingival plaque of periodontal pockets. Five Eubacterium species were tested for their ability to coaggregate with 33 oral bacterial strains. Using visual and turbidimetric assays, coaggregation was observed among Eubacterium brachy, Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium alactolyticum and Eubacterium limosum strains only when tested with Fusobacterium nucleatum strains; Eubacterium saburreum displayed only weak coaggregation ability. Coaggregation between F. nucleatum and the Eubacterium species was observed over a wide range of concentrations of each organism. The F. nucleatum strains contained a heat labile and the Eubacterium species a heat stabile coaggregation receptor. Arginine, histidine, lysine and glycine inhibited the coaggregation between F. nucleatum and the Eubacterium species. Sugars and other amino acids tested did not inhibit the observed coaggregation. Rabbit anti-F. nucleatum serum completely inhibited coaggregation, but anti-E. brachy serum and normal rabbit serum did not. As these anaerobic microorganisms are frequently isolated from the same oral lesions, the surface interactions observed may be important in the pathogenesis of these polymicrobic infections.
TI  - [Lemierre's syndrome with splenic abscesses].
AB  - A week after onset of a pharyngo-tonsillitis a previously healthy 23-year-old man developed high fever (41.4 degrees C), leukocytosis (12,200/microliters) with marked shift to the left, thrombocytopenia (86,000/microliters) and increased transaminases (GOT 83 U/l, GPT 113 U/l). Chest x-ray film suggested intrapulmonary abscesses with left-sided pleural effusion. The suspected diagnosis of "post-tonsillitis" septicaemia (Lemierre's syndrome) was confirmed by demonstrating anaerobic, fusiform, gram-negative bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum and necrophorum) in several blood cultures. Despite antibacterial treatment (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem/cilastatin, clindamycin) he had recurrent pain referred to the kidney region and persisting fever. Repeated ultrasound and radiological examinations revealed new foci in the spleen, which were enlarging. Laparotomy with splenectomy performed on day 17 after the begin of treatment confirmed multiple splenic abscesses, but abscess pus and splenic tissue were sterile. After altogether 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment, finally with chloramphenicol, the patient was discharged in a good general state.
TI  - The breakdown and utilization of peptides by strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - It has been claimed that most strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum require peptides rather than free amino acids for growth. In contrast, we have shown that, under continuous culture conditions, all strains tested grow in a chemically defined medium (CDM). The purposes of this study were to determine whether resting cells of F. nucleatum could attack unsubstituted peptides and whether growing cells could utilize a peptide fraction prepared from a commercial peptone. Resting cells cleaved all 19 peptides, containing 3-6 residues, and the 4 key energy-yielding amino acids--Glu, His, Ser and Lys--were rapidly taken up. A hydrophilic Casitone fraction, rich in Glu, promoted growth and peptides < 1 kDa were rapidly utilized. The cleaved residues metabolized were those previously shown to limit growth in CDM: Glu, Ser, His and Lys. The endopeptidase activities of Porphyromonas gingivalis would provide the necessary peptides for the growth of F. nucleatum, which may partly explain why these two organisms frequently coexist in periodontally diseased sites.
TI  - Relationship between oral gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in saliva of the mother and the colonization of her edentulous infant.
AB  - Various gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species can be detected in the oral flora of edentulous infants. However, knowledge of the initial infection source is still scarce. Thirty Caucasian mothers (mean age 30 years) and their edentulous infants (mean age 3 months) were examined for the possible similarity of the oral gram-negative anaerobic flora. Paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected from the mothers. A pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces and unstimulated saliva were collected from the infants. The samples were inoculated on nonselective and selective media and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. All of the 30 mothers harbored Fusobacterium nucleatum and 29 mothers Prevotella melaninogenica in their saliva. The salivary levels of P. melaninogenica, F. nucleatum, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella loescheii exceeded 10(4) CFU/ml in about half of the 30 mothers. At this maternal salivary level, the infants' colonization frequency of P. melaninogenica and F. nucleatum was doubled. A positive correlation between maternal salivary concentration and infant's colonization was found for P. melaninogenica. No positive association was found with nonpigmented Prevotella spp., P. intermedia and P. loescheii. It can be speculated that maternal saliva may act as a source of some gram-negative anaerobes in the oral microflora of edentulous infants as early as before tooth eruption.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Phenolic constituents in Erythrina x bidwilli and their activity against oral microbial organisms.
AB  - Five flavonoid compounds, including two new isoflavanones, were isolated from the root bark of Erythrina x bidwilli. Their structures were determined to be 2,10-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan (erythrabyssin II), 6,8-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-7,2',4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone (bidwillon A), 8-gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl-2',4'-dihydroxy-[6",6"-di-methylpyrano - (2",3":7,6)]isoflavanone (bidwillon B), 8-gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl-7,4'-dihydroxyisoflavone (8-gamma,gamma-dimethyl-allyldaidzein), and 8-gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl-5,2',4'-trihydroxy-[6",6"-dimethylpyrano+ ++- (2",3":7,6)]isoflavone (auriculatin), by means of spectroscopic analysis. Some potent activities against oral microbial organisms (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia) were shown in these flavonoid compounds.
TI  - Comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the pH responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  - Comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in pH than does glucose. In vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. Pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no pH response with this sugar. This suggested that the smaller decreases in pH seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. Variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. In the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose pH responses. These showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the pH by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. The effects were different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. The corresponding acid-base pH profiles for pure cultures were different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Identification of bacteria using DNA probes].
AB  - Since the microbial specificity of periodontal diseases is well established, having a valid microbial diagnostic test is essential for a correct and a coherent treatment planning. DNA probe will be used to identify and quantify the oral pathogens, most commonly associated with periodontitis. This test utilizes innovative DNA probe technology to identify unique segments of DNA in each of the following bacteria: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Wollinella recta, Fusobacterium nucleatum and the spirochete, Treponema denticola.
TI  - Ruptured splenic abscess secondary to infectious mononucleosis.
AB  - A 24-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis presented with fever and left upper quadrant pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a splenic abscess that at laparotomy was found to have ruptured. This case illustrates a rare cause of splenic abscess and a rare complication of infectious mononucleosis.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic microorganisms to hypothiocyanite produced by lactoperoxidase.
AB  - The susceptibility of Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Eubacterium yurii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas sputigena, Wolinella recta to hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) produced by the lactoperoxidase system was tested. Results showed a decrease of bacterial survival rate after OSCN- exposure, with an intra- and inter-species variability from 0 to 95% for C. ochracea, 34-100% for E. corrodens, 0-83% for E. yurii, 1-15% for F. nucleatum, 8-61% for P. micros, 0-100% for P. intermedia, 0-44% for S. sputigena and 0-8% for W. recta. The survival rate did not correlate with the NADH/OSCN- oxidoreductase activity present in the lysed bacteria (r = -0.3248; N = 15; NS).
TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. Periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. Only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. The antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to Actinobacillus sp., P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia in that order. In general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. However, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. In addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. These findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. Differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. These included high levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 in LJP and RPP subjects and to A. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in LJP and GJP subjects.
TI  - Role of Porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kDa outer membrane protein in the aggregation of P. gingivalis vesicles and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with Actinomyces viscosus cells. A 40-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP)-coding gene from P. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. The recombinant 40-kDa OMP did not show aggregation activity. However, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of P. gingivalis vesicles with A. viscosus cells. The antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of P. gingivalis with A. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. Moreover, aggregation of A. viscosus cells with P. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment of the A. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. These findings suggest that the 40-kDa OMP may be an important aggregation factor of P. gingivalis.

TI  - Experimentally induced infection by oral anaerobic microorganisms in a mouse model.
AB  - A mouse model was developed to study the abscessogenic potential of pure and mixed cultures of oral anaerobes associated with infections of endodontic origin. Maximum subcutaneous lesions were seen on their backs between 3 and 14 d after inoculation. Strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Veillonella parvula were pathogenic in pure culture. A mixed culture of F. nucleatum with either Porphyromonas gingivalis or Prevotella intermedia was significantly more pathogenic than F. nucleatum in pure culture. Histopathological examination of tissue sections from control mice injected with India ink in the medium demonstrated a pathway of particulate migration from the backs of the mice to their abdomen.
TI  - The establishment of human T cell lines reactive with specific periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Human T cell lines (TCLs) were obtained by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the 2 periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC-381 and Fusobacterium nucleatum FDC-263. After the first round of stimulation and rest, the cells responded specifically to the bacteria originally used to establish each line. Throughout the culture period, the responsiveness of each of the TCLs to their specific bacteria increased. Phenotypic analysis of the TCLs revealed heterogeneity of cell types. In both TCLs approximately 80% of the cells were T cells, all of which bore the alpha beta T cell receptor. The P. gingivalis-reactive TCL (PG-TCL) showed approximately equal proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, whereas the F. nucleatum-reactive TCL (FN-TCL) was predominantly CD4+. The expression of CD25, HLA-DR, CD45RA and CD29 on these CD4+ cells varied throughout the culture period of 45 days. These results demonstrate that it is possible to establish long-term T cell lines reacting to specific periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Sensitization of oral bacteria to killing by low-power laser radiation.
AB  - Twenty-seven compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize Streptococcus sanguis to killing by light from a 7.3-mW Helium/Neon (HeNe) laser. Bacteria were mixed with various concentrations of the test compounds, spread over the surfaces of agar plates, and then exposed to light from the HeNe laser for various time periods. The plates were then incubated and examined for zones of inhibition. Those compounds found to be effective photosensitizers were then tested against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Toluidine blue O, azure B chloride, and methylene blue at concentrations of 0.005% (wt/vol) were effective photosensitizers of all four species, enabling killing of bacteria following exposure to laser light for only 30 s.
TI  - Immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of Actinomyces, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.
AB  - Immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. A total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium. Two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. The mean percentages of IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. The highest titers determined by ELISA belonged to the IgG1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. The concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. The functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga, and Wolinella. Minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. High-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.
TI  - Synergistic effect of pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Our previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (PPi), the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, inhibits the growth of organisms associated with coronal and root surface caries. The purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine if periodontal pathogens are similarly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory properties of PPi; and 2) determine if combinations of pyrophosphate-sodium dodecyl sulfate (PPi-SDS) inhibit growth synergistically. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were cultured in appropriate enriched media under anaerobic conditions. Inhibition assays were performed in tubes containing media supplemented with PPi and/or SDS. A range of concentrations of PPi and SDS in 2-fold increments was employed, with each concentration assayed in triplicate. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) analyses revealed all of the bacteria were susceptible to PPi and SDS, with MICs of 0.67% (25 mM) and 0.01% w/v respectively. Combination studies with PPi-SDS showed much greater growth inhibition against P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans than achieved with the agents individually. Determination of fractional inhibitory concentration indices indicated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect. Under the constraints of the conditions employed, these studies demonstrate the efficacy of PPi-SDS combinations in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. It is conceivable that these compounds may have clinical benefit as a subgingival irrigant.
TI  - [Botryomycosis caused by fusobacteria].
AB  - In the Anglo-American literature botrymycosis is described as a chronic cutaneous granulomatous reaction to bacterial infection, containing granules resembling the sulphur granules seen in actinomycosis. The diagnostic and therapeutic aspects are discussed with reference to a recently observed patient. Fusobacterium nucleatum was isolated as the bacterial cause of the pathologic disorder.
TI  - Effect of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam on three different beta-lactamases from Bacteroides uniformis, Clostridium butyricum and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The effect of three beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam used in clinical practice were compared for their activity against purified beta-lactamases from Bacteroides uniformis, Clostridium butyricum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The enzymes from B. uniformis and C. butyricum were produced in fermenters under controlled growth conditions and the enzyme from F. nucleatum was produced in batch cultures. Purification of the beta-lactamases was achieved by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and FPLC-technique. The degree of inactivation of beta-lactamase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with nitrocefin as the substrate. The inhibitors in various concentrations were preincubated at 30 degrees C together with the enzyme for different time periods (0.5-120 min) before determination of the remaining beta-lactamase activity. The inhibitors all decreased the activity of the beta-lactamases investigated. Clavulanic acid and sulbactam were capable of reducing the enzyme activity of the B. uniformis beta-lactamase more effectively than the C. butyricum and F. nucleatum beta-lactamases. All beta-lactamases tested were more susceptible to tazobactam than to clavulanic acid and sulbactam.
TI  - Subgingival temperature (III). Relation to microbial counts.
AB  - The present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. Measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. At each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. Species enumerated were; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, P. micros, S. intermedius, S. sanguis I and II, V. parvula and W. recta. Total viable counts and counts of Capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the primary isolation plates. A total of 1581 samples were evaluated. Subject visits with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of B. intermedius I and P. micros, and lower mean %s of Capnocytophaga sp. Sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of B. intermedius I and II, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and B. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while Capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. The 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteraemia with multiple liver abscesses in an HIV-I antibody positive man with IgG2 deficiency.
AB  - Liver abscess formation due to Fusobacterium nucleatum is rare. We describe an HIV-I antibody positive man, with normal surrogate markers of cell-mediated immunity, who presented with F. nucleatum bacteraemia and liver abscess formation. He was found to have IgG2 subclass deficiency. This case illustrates the clinical importance of altered B-cell function in patients who are at an early stage of HIV disease.
TI  - The effect of cyclosporin and lipopolysaccharide on fibroblasts: implications for cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - Drug-induced gingival overgrowth is an adverse side effect associated principally with 3 different types of drugs; specifically the antiepileptic phenytoin, the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin. The present study has analyzed the effect of cyclosporin and lipopolysaccharide on fibroblasts from 3 different sources: 1) normal healthy human gingiva (NHGF); 2) overgrown gingiva from 2 patients taking cyclosporin (CHGF); and 3) human fetal lung (WI-38). Fibroblasts isolated from cyclosporin-associated gingival overgrowth were significantly less responsive to cyclosporin in terms of DNA, total protein, and proteoglycan synthesis. This finding supports the in vivo response where few fibroblasts are seen but marked overgrowth of fibrous tissue occurs. Lipopolysaccharide derived from Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli was capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis significantly in all 3 fibroblast types. Total protein synthesis by CHGF cells was inhibited differentially by Fusobacterium nucleatum LPS and addition of cyclosporin to this system resulted in reversal of the inhibition. A synergistic effect was noted when the proteoglycan output of NHGF cells was assessed in response to co-incubation with cyclosporin and Escherichia coli LPS. The study shows that bacterial LPS may be an important co-factor in the pathogenesis of cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
TI  - Serum IgG reactive with oral anaerobic microorganisms associated with infections  of endodontic origin.
AB  - Numerous species of bacteria have been implicated with infections of endodontic origin. The purpose of this study was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibodies reactive with a panel of 10 oral anaerobic microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Serum samples were collected from 4 patient groups that included healthy patients without endodontic or periodontal disease, patients with chronic adult periodontal disease, patients with endodontic disease and patients with combined endodontic-periodontal disease. When Prevotella intermedia was allowed to react with sera from the 4 patient groups, significant pairwise differences were shown between the healthy group and each of the other 3 groups. In addition, there was a significant difference between the periodontal disease group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group. When Porphyromonas gingivalis was allowed to react with sera from the 4 patient groups, significant pairwise differences were shown between the healthy group and the periodontal disease group, the healthy group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group, the endodontic disease group and the periodontal disease group and the endodontic disease group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group. The results of this investigation support other studies that associate P. intermedia with both endodontic disease and chronic adult periodontal disease. The results also support studies that implicate P. gingivalis as a periodontopathogen.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme subsp. nov. and Fusobacterium nucleatum  subsp. animalis subsp. nov. as additional subspecies within Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Using a variety of physiological, biochemical, and molecular systematic analyses, we have shown previously that there are four groups within the species Fusobacterium nucleatum. Two of these groups of strains correspond to the recently proposed taxa F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum. In this paper we show that the two remaining groups are distinct and formally propose that they should be recognized as F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme (type strain, NCTC 11326) and F. nucleatum subsp. animalis (type strain, NCTC 12276). The tests which we used did not allow a full assessment of the status of F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii compared with F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - A non-lectin-like mechanism by which Fusobacterium nucleatum 10953 adheres to and activates human lymphocytes.
AB  - Most (approximately 80%) strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum adhere to human erythrocytes in a lectin-like manner that is strongly inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). In this study, we investigated the capacity of F. nucleatum 10953, a strain that is weakly inhibited by GalNAc, to adhere to and activate human lymphocytes in vitro. Experiments using [3H]-labeled bacteria and scanning electron microscopy clearly showed that 10953 adhered to lymphocytes and that adherence was blocked by L-arginine+GalNAc greater than L-arginine much greater than GalNAc. Adherence was Ca(2+)-dependent, inhibited by pretreatment of the bacteria with proteases or heat, and unaffected by paraformaldehyde fixation of the bacteria. Strain 10953 induced lymphocyte mitogenesis that was blocked by L-arginine but not by GalNAc. These results suggest that certain strains of F. nucleatum, such as 10953, express a distinct, non-lectin-like mechanism by which they adhere to and activate lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases associated with these bacteria.
TI  - Comparative mitogenicity and polyclonal B cell activation capacity of eight oral  or nonoral bacterial lipopolysaccharides in cultures of spleen cells from athymic (nu/nu-BALB/c) and thymic (BALB/c) mice.
AB  - Optimal stimulatory doses of purified phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides  (LPS) from 5 selected strains of 3 putative periodontopathogens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Veillonella), 3 strains of 2 nonoral bacterial species (Bacteroides fragilis and Salmonella enteritidis), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced significantly higher maximum mitogenic responses and polyclonal Ig production in cultures of unfractionated spleen cells from nu/nu-BALB/c (nude) than from BALB/c (normal) mice. Compared with PWM, the LPS were stronger mitogens showing relative mitogenic capacities: B. fragilis LPS greater than F. nucleatum LPS greater than S. enteritidis LPS, Veillonella LPS, and P. intermedia LPS. B. fragilis LPS was the most and S. enteritidis LPS the least effective polyclonal B cell activator of total Ig, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA, and IgM secretion. IgG1 was not detected. P. intermedia LPS was the strongest IgA inducer. Kinetic observations indicated mitogenic responses and polyclonal B cell activation in a close sequential order in nude and normal cells. The LPS were potent Ag- and T cell-independent polyclonal B cell activators and LPS of subgingival plaque bacteria may therefore play a nonspecific role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - CD45RA and CD45RO positive CD4 cells in human peripheral blood and periodontal disease tissue before and after stimulation with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Flow cytometric analysis was used to examine naive and primed or memory CD4 cells extracted from periodontal lesions compared with cells from peripheral blood of healthy subjects before and after stimulation with the periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In peripheral blood, approximately 60% and 40% of CD4 cells were CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ respectively at day 0. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) induced CD45RO expression on almost 100% of CD4 cells. However, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum stimulation did not cause any significant change in percentage of CD45RO+ CD4 cells except for a loss of antigen at day 6 together with re-expression at day 7, which also occurred on cells cultured in medium only. CD45RA expression on PHA and bacterial-stimulated peripheral blood CD4 cells remained fairly stable for the 10-d culture period. Greater than 90% CD4 cells extracted from healthy or marginal gingivitis (H/MG) and adult periodontitis (AP) lesions were CD45RO+ and this was maintained on AP cells throughout the 6-d culture period, except for a small decrease in the percentage of positive cells induced by P. gingivalis at day 3. Approximately 9% CD4 cells from H/MG tissue were CD45RA+, but about 22% AP cells expressed this antigen, and this increased again in P. gingivalis- and F. nucleatum-stimulated cultures after 3 d. Therefore, in peripheral blood P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum do not act as nonspecific T-cell mitogens and, in AP cells, these bacteria induce changes in phenotype, supporting previous data that although they may be polyclonal B-cell activators, they activate antigen specific T-cells.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - The association of occult amniotic fluid infection with gestational age and neonatal outcome among women in preterm labor.
AB  - To evaluate the relationships between gestational age, neonatal outcome, and amniotic fluid (AF) bacteria, we obtained AF from women with intact membranes in idiopathic preterm labor. Positive cultures were obtained from 20 (19%) of 105 women. The frequency of positive cultures was inversely related to gestational age: 23-26 weeks, nine of 20; 27-30 weeks, four of 24; and 31-34 weeks, seven of 61 (chi2 for trend, P less than .001). Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were the most common isolates. Facultative and anaerobic bacteria were more commonly isolated from women at less than 30 weeks' gestation, and Ureaplasma urealyticum was commonly isolated at greater than 30 weeks' gestation. Forty percent of the patients identified as having positive AF facultative and anaerobic cultures by the research laboratory had negative cultures in the clinical laboratory. Clinical characteristics and maternal white blood cell count and differential did not differ between women with and without positive cultures. Elevated C-reactive protein levels and a positive AF Gram stain were the two most sensitive and specific methods to predict positive AF cultures. Women with positive cultures delivered a median of 1.0 day after enrollment, compared with 28.5 days for women with negative cultures. The median gestational age at delivery for women with positive cultures was 27.5 weeks, and the median birth weight was 866 g. Positive AF cultures were associated with respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and neonatal death. If occult AF infection among women in preterm labor is a treatable cause of preterm birth, then treatment could markedly reduce both perinatal morbidity and mortality.
TI  - [Polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated effects on human oral keratinocytes by periodontopathic bacterial extracts].
AB  - In order to investigate the polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated oral keratinocyte injury, the author established a method to culture keratinocytes (SCC9 and gingival keratinocytes) and subjected to the cell detachment assay by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and/or bacterial ultrasonic extracts from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Bacteroides forsythus OMZ 408, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, Capnocytophaga sputigena 4 and Eikenella corrodens 1073. The bacterial extracts alone caused no cell disruption of the keratinocyte monolayers. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte alone caused only a minimal cell detachment. On the contrary, when the bacterial extracts were added to the co-culture of keratinocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, cell detachment of keratinocytes was observed except for the bacterial extract from Eikenella corrodens 1073. The effect of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 was the strongest. This effect was heat labile and not inhibited by polymyxin B. Cell detachment was inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin but not by catalase and superoxide dismutase. No keratinocyte lysis was observed in terms of 51Cr release. Hydrogen peroxide and leukocyte elastase also caused keratinocyte detachment. These results indicate that polymorphonuclear leukocyte can cause non-lytic cell detachment of the gingival keratinocytes when encountering some bacteria, which may lead to the increase of the permeability of the keratinocyte layers.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum pyomyositis.
AB  
TI  - Serial doxycycline and metronidazole in prevention of recurrent periodontitis in  high-risk patients.
AB  - The efficacy of metronidazole and doxycycline in preventing recurrent periodontitis was studied in 23 patients. After treatment in the previous 7 months with either bimonthly scaling and 3 weeks of systemic doxycycline (11 subjects) or scaling and placebo (12 subjects), patients were monitored for recurrent periodontitis and were scaled every 2 months. When either a periodontal abscess or greater than 2 mm loss of gingival attachment was observed, metronidazole was administered (250 mg every 8 hours) for 10 days. In the placebo plus metronidazole group, 5 patients (42%) exhibited recurrent periodontitis after the metronidazole regimen compared with only one (9%) in the doxycycline plus metronidazole group (P less than 0.096). Subgingival plaque samples at study and healthy control sites were screened for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum by immunofluorescence and for spirochetes using Ryu's stain. Presence/absence analysis of the sum of scores of the 6 individual pathogens demonstrated large reductions (P less than 0.005) in the frequency of detection of pathogens in the former doxycycline compared with the placebo plus metronidazole group at both study and control sites before and one month after metronidazole. By 7 months after metronidazole, there was no detectable difference between groups. These results indicate that prevention of recurrent periodontitis with metronidazole may be enhanced by previous treatment with doxycycline.
TI  - The early colonization of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in edentulous infants.
AB  - The occurrence of oral gram-negative anaerobes was examined in 30 edentulous infants (mean age 3 months, range 1-7 months). One pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces (cheeks, palate, tongue) and one saliva sample was taken from each infant. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using non-selective and selective media. Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica was the most frequently isolated anaerobe, found in 70% of the infants. The other common anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella spp. and nonpigmented Prevotella (Bacteroides) spp., found in 60%, 57% and 57% of the infants, respectively. Of corroding bacilli, Bacteroides gracilis was detected in 23% of the infants, Wolinella spp. and microaerophilic Eikenella corrodens in one infant (3% each). Leptotrichia spp., microaerophilic Capnocytophaga spp., Prevotella (Bacteroides) loescheii and Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia were found in 17%, 13%, 13% and 7% of the infants, respectively. In addition to these 30 infants, 21 edentulous infants were investigated for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans only. A. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the 51 edentulous infants. The number of different anaerobic bacterial species in the same mouth varied from 0 to 7. No anaerobic bacteria were detected in 3 of 30 children (10%). These data suggest that various anaerobic bacterial species readily colonize the edentulous mouth in infants.
TI  - The use of DNA probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  - The present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. The mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). The probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. The % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; V. parvula, 98; B. intermedius I, 98; S. sanguis II, 96; B. intermedius II, 95; C. ochracea, 94; B. gingivalis, 91; S. sanguis I, 85; W. recta, 83; F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; S. intermedius, 80; B. forsythus, 76; P. micros, 74; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. The % of sites colonized by each of the 14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. The median number of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for V. parvula. In half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than 4%. When subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Synergistic degradation of bovine serum albumin by mutans streptococci and other  dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Mutans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus) exhibited low levels of proteolytic activity against the model protein substrate, FITC-labelled bovine serum albumin, when incubated alone. Inclusion of other members of the dental plaque microflora in the assay usually resulted in marked increases in the degree of proteolysis and a high level of synergy. Interactions between mutans streptococci and either Streptococcus oralis or Fusobacterium nucleatum gave rise to the greatest degree of synergistic proteolytic degradation.
TI  - [Thoracic empyema caused by anaerobes. 78-month retrospective study. Clinical and microbiological aspects].
AB  - The authors considered the microbiological and clinical aspects of the thoracic empyemas caused by anaerobic bacteria observed at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital, Turin, over a period of 78 months. In this period 321 patients were subjected to thoracentesis in order to take samples of the pleural fluid (PF) which was in turn subjected to culture investigations. 31 patients (9.6%) had one or more cultures which were positive for bacterial growth. A good 12 patients (38.7%) had cultures which were positive for anaerobes alone or associated with aerobes. The average age of these patients (8 male, 4 female) was 62.5 years (range, 42 TO 84 Y.). Underlying diseases and predisposing conditions were as follows: malignancy (4 patients), neurological disorders (4p), severe hypoalbuminemia (5 p), bronchial obstruction (3 p), previous gastroenteric or chest surgery (3 p), diabetes mellitus (2 p), alcoholism (2 p), atherosclerosis (1 p), alveolar hypoventilation caused by chest wall disorder (1 p). The etiopathogenesis of the empyema was as follows; postpneumonic, 5 cases (41.7%); postsurgical, 4 cases (33.3%); esophageal fistula, 1 case (8.3%); idiopathic, 2 cases (16.7%). In 5 cases (441.7%) empyema developed in hospital, in 7 cases (58.3%) in community. Forty-one percent of the empyemas were described as foul-smelling. The anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococci in this order. Thoracentesis was performed on 6 patients, chest tube drainage was required in 6, and antibiotics were administered to all the patients. Length of Hospitalization averaged 33>2 days. Three patients (30%) died. These patients died during the same hospitalization period while empyema was an active problem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - 2-Hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum): an iron-sulfur flavoprotein.
AB  - Anaerobically prepared cell-free extracts from Fusobacterium nucleatum contain 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase with a specific activity of 20 nkat mg-1. The enzyme was purified 24-fold to a specific activity of 480 nkat mg-1 by anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and chromatography on Blue-Sepharose. The activity of the purified enzyme was strictly dependent on the reductant Ti(III)citrate and stimulated 25-fold by 0.15 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCl2. ATP is hydrolysed to ADP during incubation with 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase in the presence or absence of the substrate. The enzyme is extremely sensitive towards oxygen and is inhibited by 10 microM chloramphenicol, 10 microM 2,4-dinitrophenol or 0.15 mM hydroxylamine. The pure enzyme consists of three subunits alpha (49 kDa), beta (39 kDa) and gamma (24 kDa) in approximately equal amounts. In this respect the enzyme differs from the related 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans and lactyl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium propionicum both of which are composed of only two subunits with sizes comparable to those of alpha and beta but require an additional protein for activity. The relative molecular mass of the native enzyme of about 100 kDa suggests a trimeric alpha beta gamma-structure. The homogeneous enzyme contains riboflavin (0.5 mol/112 kDa), iron and sulfur (3.5 mol/112 kDa each). Polyclonal antibodies directed against the 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from A. fermentans did not crossreact with cell free extracts or purified dehydratase from F. nucleatum. A comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the dehydratase subunits from A. fermentans and F. nucleatum, however, showed some similarities in the beta-subunits.
TI  - Different responses in B cells induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A phenotypic study had shown that gingival B cells respond differently to two periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Further investigation now shows a reduction in the percentage of Ki-67 + T cells in cultures of gingival and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with P. gingivalis for 3 and 6 days, respectively, but no suppression of Ki-67 expression in B cells in response to either P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. Depletion studies of cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that in the absence of CD4 cells, the percentage of CD19+ and CD20+ B cells stimulated with P. gingivalis increased after 6 days whereas depletion of CD8 cells resulted in a rise in the percentage of F. nucleatum- and P. gingivalis-stimulated B cells, although this was not significant in the case of P. gingivalis. Specific antibody to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum was found in culture supernatants of gingival but not of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating a possible higher frequency of antigen-specific B cells in periodontal lesions. IgG was the predominant isotype in both gingival and control peripheral blood cultures, followed closely by IgA in gingival cultures. F. nucleatum stimulated higher levels of Ig in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than P. gingivalis or cells cultured in medium only, whereas in gingival cell cultures, stimulation by P. gingivalis appeared to result in higher levels of IgG. Also Ig was present at day 3 in gingival cultures, whereas in the blood cell cultures, Ig was only detected at day 6, further suggesting a degree of activation of of gingival B cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Correlation of haemagglutination activity with trypsin-like protease activity of  Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium associated with various forms of periodontal disease. Several characteristics of P. gingivalis are thought to contribute to its pathogenicity; these include haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity. Previous studies suggest an association between haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity of P. gingivalis. To investigate this, two complementary quantitative experimental approaches were taken. Five independent mutants of P. gingivalis deficient in trypsin-like protease activity were shown to exhibit reduced haemagglutination activity. In addition, enhancers (cysteine and dithiothreitol) and inhibitors (N-ethylmaleimide, N-p-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) of trypsin-like protease activity were shown, respectively, to significantly enhance and inhibit haemagglutination activity of washed, wild-type P. gingivalis cells (p less than 0.05, paired t-test). Statistical analysis indicated a strong correlation between haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001, Spearman rank correlation). The effect of the protease enhancers and inhibitors on haemagglutination activity was specific for P. gingivalis, as they did not significantly change the haemagglutination activity of Fusobacterium nucleatum. These results suggest that the proteolytic site of the trypsin-like protease participates in haemagglutination activity of P. gingivalis.
TI  - The effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, Listerine Antiseptic (thymol), Peridex (chlorhexidine), Perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. At the baseline examination, papillary bleeding score (PBS), and plaque index (PI) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. Subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. At day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. Statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the 4 groups, followed by Duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. At baseline, average PBS and PI scores were similar for all 4 groups. After 14 days, the average PBS for Peridex and Perimed was significantly lower than for Listerine Antiseptic and water. The frequency of interdental units with a PBS greater than 2 was significantly lower for Peridex and Perimed than for Listerine Antiseptic and water. We concluded that both Peridex and Perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. In vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with Perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.
TI  - Sugar metabolism by fusobacteria: regulation of transport, phosphorylation, and polymer formation by Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557.
AB  - Strains of eight Fusobacterium species differed in the ability to use sugars as energy sources for growth. For Fusobacterium russii ATCC 25533, F. gonidiaformans ATCC 25563, and F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 (except for fructose), growth was marginal to poor on all of the sugars tested. Other species displayed reasonable growth on glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose, and two strains of F. mortiferum (ATCC 25557 and ATCC 9817) grew well on six of the sugars tested, including sucrose and maltose. Glucose transport by resting cells of most of the species was dependent upon (or markedly stimulated by) the presence of a fermentable amino acid. By contrast, F. mortiferum cells rapidly accumulated glucose and other sugars in the absence of amino acids. Although these cells were constitutive for glucose uptake, accumulation of other sugars was specifically induced by growth of F. mortiferum on the appropriate sugar. Spectrophotometric analyses and in situ staining of anionic polyacrylamide gels showed that glucose and fructose (mannose) are phosphorylated by separate ATP-dependent kinases. Fructokinase was stable in air at 4 degrees C, but under these conditions, greater than 70% of the glucokinase activity was lost. After overnight dialysis of the extract, no glucokinase activity was detectable; however, 65% of the initial enzyme activity was retained by inclusion of 1 mM dithiothreitol in the dialysis buffer. Thin-section electron microscopy showed that cells of F. mortiferum produced various amounts of intracellular glycogen during growth on the following sugars (in decreasing order of formation): galactose greater than sucrose greater than glucose greater than mannose greater than fructose. Mechanisms for sugar transport regulation, phosphorylation, and polymer synthesis by F. mortiferum cells are proposed.
TI  - Formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - During the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. Although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.
TI  - Osteomyelitis of the pelvis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Anaerobic pelvic osteomyelitis occurs rarely in children. A case of Fusobacterium nucleatum osteomyelitis of the right ilium [correction of ileum] in a child without apparent risk factors is described. This case emphasizes the value of diagnostic aspirates. Therapy with a combination of intravenous and oral clindamycin led to successful resolution of the infection.
TI  - Phenotypic analysis of B-cells extracted from human periodontal disease tissue.
AB  - B-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue were analyzed for the presence  of activation markers using a range of monoclonal antibodies. In adult periodontitis (AP), 6% of B-cells expressed the IL-2 receptor (CD25) compared with 1-2% in peripheral blood and healthy or marginal gingivitis (H/MG) gingival B-cells. There was also an increase in the mean percentage of IgD-positive B-cells and a decrease in CD21 and CD22 expression. In both AP and H/MG lesions, 20-22% of the B-cells expressed CD23 compared with less than 5% in peripheral blood. As B-cells are activated by day 3 in culture and start differentiating into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by day 6, B-cell phenotypes were assayed at these times in this study. Following stimulation with the periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression of CD23, CD21 and CD22 on B-cells extracted from AP lesions remained relatively constant over the 6-d culture period. However, with Fusobacterium nucleatum stimulation, there was a significant decrease in CD23, CD21 and CD22 expression after 3 d in culture, which corresponds to the activation time for B-cells. These results show that B-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue display a range of activation markers and on stimulation, demonstrate differing responses to individual periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Accumulation of plasma cells in inflamed sites: effects of antigen, nonspecific microbial activators, and chronic inflammation.
AB  - Plasma cells are common in chronically inflamed sites, including periodontal lesions. The aim of this study was to determine which factors contribute to this local accumulation of plasma cells. Specifically, we sought to evaluate the effects of specific antigen and nonspecific activators from an infectious agent associated with chronic inflammation (Fusobacterium nucleatum, an organism prominent in chronic periodontal lesions) and the effect of the chronic inflammation itself. Chronic inflammation (14 to 17 days) was induced in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-immune rabbits by subcutaneous injection of 50 microliters of sterile alum in several sites in their backs. Controls included sites injected with saline or more acute sites examined after 3 days of alum inflammation. Sites were challenged with HRP (the antigen), sonicated F. nucleatum (the nonspecific activator), or both together to see whether F. nucleatum has an adjuvant effect. Three days after challenge, HRP-specific antibody-forming cells (AFC) were enumerated after peroxidase histochemistry. In noninflamed sites or sites with acute inflammation, virtually no HRP-specific AFC were evident. In contrast, chronic inflammation alone was sufficient to elicit a specific AFC response (congruent to 10 cells per mm2). Addition of either F. nucleatum or HRP to the chronic lesion about doubled the number of HRP-specific AFC. However, a dramatic 8- to 15-fold (80 to 150/mm2) increase was seen in chronically inflamed sites challenged with antigen and activator together. Interestingly, the activator did not have this adjuvant effect in the acute sites or in normal skin. In short, accumulation of plasma cells in inflamed sites is promoted by chronic inflammation, activators of microbial origin, and specific antigen. This milieu can be expected to develop in some periodontal lesions and could help explain why gingival crevicular fluid from some sites may contain extraordinary levels of locally produced specific antibodies for certain antigens.
TI  - Use of synthetic oligonucleotide DNA probes for the identification of different strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. Probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the N-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum strain Fev1. Probe H 2.1, was a randomly cloned chromosomal DNA fragment of 2.1 kbp. The specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of Fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different oral species of six other genera. The chromosomal DNA of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes HincII, HindIII, EcoRI, EcoRV and Sau3AI. Digests were run on agarose gels and subjected to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. The results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic DNA from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe H 2.1. Probe H 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. By use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of F. nucleatum could be performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens and Leptotrichia buccalis. The probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus Fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.
TI  - The microflora of periodontal sites showing active destructive progression.
AB  - 20 adult periodontitis (AP) subjects were examined every 2 to 4 months and microbiological samples were collected and cultured when 2 mm or more loss of attachment (active sites) was detected by 2 examiners. Similar sites in which no progressive destruction was observed (control sites) also were sampled in the same subjects. By lambda-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in floras of active (42 sites from 12 subjects) and control (36 sites from 12 subjects) sites or between the floras of the active and control sites and of 63 samples from 22 AP subjects that were examined previously in a cross-sectional study. By paired t test, no microbial species had a significantly greater association with active than with control sites. The only species that were detected in one or more samples from all subjects with active sites were Wolinella recta, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Porphyromonas gingivalis and 9 other taxa were isolated from one-half or more of the persons with active sites. The composition of microbiological floras of all periodontitis samples was statistically significantly different from that of subjects with healthy gingiva. The composition of microfloras of sites in subjects with naturally-occurring gingivitis was intermediate between that of subjects with healthy gingiva and that of active and control sites in AP subjects.
TI  - Systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in the cynomolgus monkey: development of methodology and longitudinal responses during ligature-induced disease.
AB  - Systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms were studied during ligature-induced periodontal disease in a non-human primate (Nhp) model. Methodology was developed using ELISA techniques to assess total IgG and IgM levels in the serum from the Nhp. In addition, an ELISA was developed utilizing affinity-purified anti-human isotype reagents to detect Nhp serum antibody responses to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Results showed that the anti-human reagents detected IgG and IgM from Macaca fascicularis with an efficiency of 25-35% and 50-60%, respectively. Following ligation, groups of Nhp were treated with an immunomodulator ("Thymopentin", TP5) or placebo to examine the effect of the T-cell stimulating agent on periodontitis and host responses. No differences were noted in total serum IgG and IgM levels for individual Nhp or between groups when baseline, ligation and treatment intervals were compared. However, following ligation, 8/12 Nhp exhibited significant increases in IgG and/or IgM antibody to P. gingivalis that were coincident with increases in the percentage of this microorganism in the subgingival plaque from the ligated sites. During the treatment phase, the antibody levels in the placebo group continued to increase, while the levels in the TP5-treated group stabilized. The findings in this study indicate that the emergence of a microorganism in the subgingival plaque (P. gingivalis) during the conversion from gingivitis to progressing periodontitis in the Nhp, elicits a systemic antibody response that is specific for the microorganism.
TI  - Relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  - The relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. A subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using Gracey curettes. Samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the DNA fixed to the filters. Digoxygenin-labeled DNA probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17 of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. The % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. The species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the active and inactive subjects were as follows; B gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; W. recta 1.3, 0.6; B. intermedius I 2.5, 2.0; B. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; F. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; S. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; P. micros 1.5, 1.5; B. intermedius II 1.6, 1.7; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; S. sanguis I 1.8, 2.1; S. sanguis II 2.7, 3.0; V. parvula 3.9, 4.2; C. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A selective medium for Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - A new selective medium (JVN) for the isolation of Fusobacterium spp. from clinical material is described. The medium incorporates josamycin, vancomycin and norfloxacin (at 3, 4 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively) as the selective agents, plus 5% defibrinated horse blood in Fastidious Anaerobe Agar Base (Lab M). This formula allowed luxuriant growth of all 82 strains (eight recognized species) of fusobacteria tested, while significantly inhibiting 51/51 (100%) strains of facultative anaerobes and 45/51 (88%) strains of other obligate anaerobes. JVN medium allowed the successful isolation of strains of Fusobacterium naviforme, F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum from the gingivae of 9/16 healthy volunteers, and strains of F. varium and F. mortiferum from faecal suspensions seeded with these organisms.
TI  - Predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis.
AB  - The predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis was investigated by culturing pus from affected sites in 20 patients. Twenty colonies were picked at random from non-selective plates and identified using conventional biochemical and physiological tests, analysis of metabolic end-products by gas chromatography and protein profile analysis. The most frequently isolated organisms were Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis was not isolated and asaccharolytic Eubacterium species were virtually absent. The predominant cultivable microflora in pericoronitis was found to be highly anaerobic in nature and superficially similar to that found in chronic periodontitis, although proposed marker organisms of severe periodontitis were absent.
TI  - Comparison of the amino acid uptake profile of reference and clinical isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies.
AB  - Human isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies appear to colonize different niches in the oral cavity, which may be reflected in their nutritional properties. Consequently the utilization of nitrogenous substrates, their sources of energy (supplied here as amino acids) were compared between the 3 subspecies using the reference strain and fresh clinical isolates of each subspecies. All strains incorporated mainly acidic and basic amino acids but significant differences occurred between subspecies. Both reference and clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subspecies polymorphum utilized all amino acids in the medium but the levels of glutamate, arginine and cysteine were noticeably higher in the reference strain. By contrast, F. nucleatum subspecies fusiforme used a very restricted range of amino acids, of which only glutamate, arginine, histidine and cysteine were taken up at greater than 0.5 mM. F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum utilized fewer amino acids than F. nucleatum subspecies polymorphum but higher concentrations were taken up by the former. Clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum incorporated polar and nonpolar neutral amino acids poorly but their levels increased steadily as a clinical isolate was subcultured over a period of 4 months, and was eventually similar to the reference strain. The effect of adding the key catabolic substrate, glutamate (10 mM), on the amino acid uptake profile of F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum resulted in the complete suppression of the dibasic amino acids arginine, ornithine and histidine. Strains of this subspecies could grow on glutamate as a major source of carbon and energy but, morphologically, the cells appeared somewhat distended and had a tendency to clump.
TI  - Adhesive properties of strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum of the subspecies nucleatum, vincentii and polymorphum.
AB  - This study surveyed some adhesive properties of strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum representative of the 3 recently defined groups or subspecies that could relate to their colonization and virulence. With one exception, F. nucleatum strains agglutinated sheep erythrocytes, but the quantity of bacteria required and the sensitivity of the hemagglutination reactions to inhibition by 0.05 M galactose or arginine varied between strains, and did not exhibit clear-cut correlations with subspecies. Neuraminidase treatment of erythrocytes generally enhanced the hemagglutinating activity of most strains, but trypsin treatment had no effect. Strains of F. nucleatum also attached in moderate numbers to buccal epithelial cells. Treatment of the epithelial cells with neuraminidase or with trypsin increased the numbers of all Fusobacterium strains that attached. Treatment of hydroxyapatite (HA) beads with submandibular or parotid saliva also promoted the adhesion of all strains of F. nucleatum studied. Treatment of HA with human serum or albumin produced a selective effect. Adhesion of some strains was promoted by serum and albumin treatment, and that of other strains was unaffected. Adhesion of all strains of F. nucleatum was enhanced to statherin-treated HA, whereas HA treated with salivary proline-rich protein-1 did not foster F. nucleatum attachment. Three of 4 strains of the subspecies vincentii, and each of 2 polymorphum strains studied exhibited strong adhesion to HA treated with either human type I or type IV collagen. However, only 1 of 5 strains of the subspecies nucleatum bound well to collagen-treated HA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Protein-kinase-C-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin E2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  - Certain bacterial species, of which we selected Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. The release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin E2. Bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the case of P. acnes. Furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin E2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. It is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [Ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. Changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to F. nucleatum (Gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while P. anaerobius (Gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. In both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred independently of protein kinase C, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. These results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase C and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+].
TI  - Structure and bacterial receptor activity of a human salivary proline-rich glycoprotein.
AB  - Using an overlay technique, we previously showed that the Gram-negative periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum binds to a glycoprotein of Mr 89,000 (Prakobphol, A., Murray, P., and Fischer, S.J. (1987) Anal. Biochem. 164, 5-11) in the parotid saliva of some individuals. We now show that deglycosylation of the purified glycoprotein results in loss of receptor activity. Amino acid analysis of the protein core showed predominantly proline, glycine, and glutamic acid/glutamine, a characteristic of proline-rich glycoproteins (PRG). The amino terminus contained repeating sequences of Ser-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro-Glu-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro- Gln-Gly that had significant compositional and sequence homology to that encoded by exon 3 of the PRB3 gene. We analyzed the PRG oligosaccharides by a combination of mass spectrometry techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Twenty-seven highly fucosylated structures were identified. The most abundant was as follows (where Fuc is fucose). (formula; see text) To understand the structural basis of F. nucleatum binding, we screened glycolipids and neoglycolipids carrying carbohydrate structures related to those of the PRG for receptor activity; components with unsubstituted terminal lactosamine residues best supported adherence. Neoglycolipids constructed from PRG oligosaccharides were also receptors. Treatment with beta-galactosidase, but not alpha-fucosidase, abolished binding, suggesting that unsubstituted lactosamine units, including the 6-antenna of the major oligosaccharide, mediate F. nucleatum adherence.
TI  - Tetracycline fiber therapy monitored by DNA probe and cultural methods.
AB  - Oligonucleotide DNA probe and selective cultural methods were compared in their ability to monitor 6 putative periodontal pathogens in a study evaluating local tetracycline fiber therapy. Subgingival plaque was sampled from 4 sites in each of 20 subjects. Samples were taken before and after therapy from sites assigned to the following test groups: tetracycline (TC) fiber, scaling and root planing, control fiber, and untreated. Each sample was analyzed by both DNA probe and cultural methods. Total anaerobic cultivable counts, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius) were enumerated on nonselective blood agar. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Wolinella recta were isolated on selective media. TC fiber therapy and scaling reduced total cultivable counts from an initial value of 1 x 10(7) to approximately 2 x 10(5) following therapy. Total counts at untreated sites and at sites with control fibers did not change from baseline. A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens were detected more frequently by the cultural method; the other monitored species were detected more frequently by DNA probes than by the cultural methods. Agreements between methods were: 77.2% for A. actinomycetemcomitans; 72.2% for P. intermedia; 75.6% for E. corrodens; 39.4% for F. nucleatum; 35.6% for P. gingivalis; and 68.9% for W. recta. Limitations of the selective cultural methods used probably contributed to the discrepancies for P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. DNA probe and cultural methods indicated comparable levels of suppression of the monitored species following TC fiber therapy and scaling. The microbiota of control fiber and untreated sites did not appear to be significantly altered by either method.
TI  - Multicenter evaluation of tetracycline fiber therapy. III. Microbiological response.
AB  - In a multicenter study of the effects of tetracycline (TC) fiber therapy, subgingival plaque samples were tested for 6 probable periodontal pathogens by DNA probe analysis. Levels of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius), and Wolinella recta were quantitatively determined in samples taken at baseline, and immediately after TC fiber removal, control fiber removal, and scaling and root planing. At untreated sites, samples were taken at baseline and 10 d later. Specificity of the DNA probe method was evaluated by testing the hybridization to 83 reference cultures. Interaction of the F. nucleatum probe with Fusobacterium periodonticum, and of the W. recta probe with Wolinella curva were the only cross-hybridizations noted. Species were detected at an average sensitivity of 2.9 x 10(4) organisms per sample. Approximately 70% of sites were initially infected with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum; 50% with P. intermedia and E. corrodens; infections with W. recta and A. actinomycetemcomitans were less common (36% and 11% respectively). The average numbers of organisms found in the plaque samples were highest for F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and P. intermedia (ca. 10(6)). E. corrodens, W. recta, and A. actinomycetemcomitans occurred at 10-fold lower levels. Bacterial numbers and proportions of species in subgingival sites from the five centers did not differ appreciably. Both TC fiber therapy and scaling decreased the number of sites infected with all the monitored species. The bacterial composition at untreated sites and at sites where control fibers were placed was not significantly altered. The percentage reduction of the number of sites with detectable infection varied with each species: from 86% with W. recta to approximately 40% with P. gingivalis. Significant reduction of pocket depth and bleeding occurred at TC fiber-treated sites infected with each of the species. Significant attachment level gain occurred only at sites initially infected with P. gingivalis and treated with TC fibers.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the Dominican Republic.
AB  - A study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Paper point sampling, transport in VMGA III, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. Direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. Nonselective culturing showed Gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. Fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and Peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. Enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. Enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, Klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in 10 patients. Parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the USA. In conclusion, fewer spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in Santo Domingo patients compared to those in USA. High levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in Santo Domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  - Ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. In addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. Fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. The most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, black-pigmented Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented Bacteroides, Veillonella, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans. Of the 50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. This study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance in Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Of 15 Peptostreptococcus sp. strains isolated between 1975 and 1984, 13 hybridized with the Tet K, Tet M, or Tet O determinant. A donor Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain carrying the three determinants could transfer Tet M to P. anaerobius and Fusobacterium nucleatum recipients but not to an Enterococcus faecalis recipient, while neither Tet K nor Tet O was transferred.
TI  - A study of the antigenic composition of the fragilis group of Bacteroides.
AB  - Representative strains of 22 serotypes of the fragilis group of Bacteroides and four non-fragilis control strains of B. melaninogenicus, B. disiens, B. bivius and Fusobacterium nucleatum were tested by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with hyperimmune rabbit sera. SDS-PAGE showed 25 polypeptide bands but, after immunoblotting, 24 antigenic bands were observed in various combinations in all the strains. Three of these were detected only in the control strains, whereas six others were present in different combinations in all strains of the fragilis group but were not present in the controls. Cluster analysis of the antigenic bands showed that the controls were antigenically different from the fragilis group strains. Strains of the fragilis group from the same geographic localities grouped in single clusters; most faecal isolates and NCTC strains appeared separate. There was no correlation between the species of Bacteroides and their antigenic structure. SDS-PAGE with immunoblotting is a superior technique for typing the fragilis group of Bacteroides. Specific antigens have been identified which may be used in the serodiagnosis of infection with these organisms.
TI  - Aspects of the growth and metabolism of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 in continuous culture.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, a type strain of one of the newly proposed subspecies of this group of organisms, was grown anaerobically in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. Its response to conditions of varying pH, nutritional environment, and imposed growth rate were then examined. The organism failed to grow at pH 7.8 but grew at pH 5.8, although the cell yield was greatly reduced. At pH 6.8 the cell yield was halved and less than 50% of available glucose was consumed. The optimum growth pH was around 7.4 when the culture appeared to be limited for both glucose and the amino acids glutamate, histidine and serine. Some intracellular polyglucose (IP) was produced and acetate, butyrate and ammonia were the major fermentation end-products, as they were under all growth conditions tested. Increasing the available glucose or amino acids did not alter cell numbers but the amount of IP was greatly increased. When glucose was omitted from the medium, the cell yield was halved and the culture then became limited for lysine as well as for glutamate, histidine and serine. Growth rate had little overall effect on the organism's physiology and the maximum growth rate at pH 7.4 was 0.20 h-1, a doubling time of 3.5 h. Glucose was thus channelled into stable IP synthesis only when the growth limitation imposed by lack of fermentable amino acids was relieved. The metabolism of IP and the ability to obtain carbon and energy from a variety of substrates may explain why F. nucleatum is one of the most commonly detected organisms in subgingival dental plaque.
TI  - Adherence to experimental pellicle of rough-type lipopolysaccharides from subgingival plaque bacteria.
AB  - The adherence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from periodontal disease-associated bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) and serum-coated HA beads was examined by chromogenic Limulus activity (toxicolor test). Phenol-water extracted LPS preparations from Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and rough-type LPS from Escherichia coli adhered to S-HA and serum-coated beads and agglutinated human erythrocytes. The adhered LPSs to S-HA and serum-coated HA beads were not removed by vigorous washing with distilled water. LPSs from Bacteroides (Porphyromonas) gingivalis strains and wild-type E. coli did not adhere to S-HA, serum-coated HA beads or show hemagglutinating activity. SDS-PAGE patterns stained with silver stain showed that LPSs adhered to S-HA, and serum-coated HA beads and erythrocytes possessed a distinct fast-migrating band similar to rough-type LPS. B. gingivalis LPSs possessed slow-migrating and repeating ladder bands similar to wild-type LPS.
TI  - Fluorescence immunoassay for detecting periodontal bacterial pathogens in plaque.
AB  - A particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay has been modified into a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (BCFIA) to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. The BCFIA utilizes fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative plaque bacteria. Microorganisms closely associated with periodontal disease that can be identified in plaque with the BCFIA include Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens. Briefly, the procedure involved mixing a patient's plaque sample or other bacterial preparation with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MAb in a specialized microtiter plate. This mixture was incubated to allow binding of the MAb to its homologous bacteria. The bound and unbound fluorescent tagged MAbs were separated by filtration in the modified microtiter plate, and the total bacterial bound fluorescence was determined with a fluorimeter. The number of a specific bacterial species in a given plaque sample or other bacterial suspension was estimated by reference to a primary standard carried through the BCFIA. The lower detection limit of the BCFIA was 10(3) to 10(4) bacterial cells from single cultures of bacteria or 10(4) bacterial cells in mixed cultures. The coefficient of variation within and between plates for each of the five bacterium-specific MAbs in screening plaque for the periodontal pathogens was less than 10%. These results demonstrate that microbes in plaque can be used as the solid phase in the BCFIA to detect and quantitate MAbs associated with specific bacteria quickly and reliably.
TI  - [Severe infections due to Streptococcus milleri in children].
AB  - Streptococcus milleri (S. milleri) is found in healthy individuals in the mouth,  nasopharynx, throat, vagina and in feces, and has been reported to be isolated from several infectious diseases in man, particularly from abscess in various parts of the body. We report two cases of severe infections due to S. milleri isolated from subdural abscess and pleural empyema. [Case 1] 13 year old boy who had been healthy until he was noticed to have meningeal signs and was diagnosed as left subdural abscess with siagonantritis by cranial CT scans. S. milleri was isolated from subdural abscess and maxillary sinus. [Case 2] 10 year old boy who had encephalitis and severe mental retardation after measles at 6 months of age. He had a fever, dyspnea and chest X-ray abnormalities and was diagnosed as right pleural empyema. Three strains of organism, S milleri, Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated from the pleural effusion.
TI  - Isolation and purification of bacteriocin from Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius).
AB  - Thirty-three out of 46 strains of Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. Thirteen isolates did not have the ability to inhibit the growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611. An inhibition factor from one of the isolates, P. intermedia TH14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. Bacteriocin TH14 activity was effective against only P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and Fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including P. intermedia ATCC 33563, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis), Capnocytophaga sputigena and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin TH14. Bacteriocin TH14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain ATCC 25611 in 15 minutes. The growth inhibition of P. intermedia ATCC 25611 by bacteriocin TH14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.
TI  - Dental bacterial plaques. Nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  - Antony van Leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. However, not until almost 200 years later was the famous Koch postulate introduced. Since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. In spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession of organisms. Lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. Among the commonly mentioned are: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as Eubacterium species. Anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. However, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. The general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis in adults. The definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The use of genomic DNA fingerprinting in studies of the epidemiology of bacteria  in periodontitis.
AB  - Recent studies of microbial epidemiology emphasizing the genetic organization and distribution of organisms associated with orofacial infections have led to new insights into the possible origins of pathogenicity. Studies into genetic heterogeneity, acquisition and transmission of these organisms have been markedly advanced by the utilization of the powerful technique of genomic DNA fingerprinting. Characteristic fingerprints for each bacterial isolate can be produced by cleavage of high molecular weight genomic DNA by restriction endonucleases. It is assumed that each DNA fingerprint represents a clonal type. In this report, we review and analyze studies of the epidemiology of bacteria associated with orofacial infections with an emphasis on periodontal disease. Studies of nontypable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae associated with recurrent otitis media illustrate the utility of this technique. DNA fingerprinting clearly demonstrates genetic heterogeneity of NT H. influenzae isolates, and clonality of infection of any individual. Furthermore, DNA fingerprinting has shown that the same clonal type is seen in siblings concurrently suffering from otitis media, suggesting horizontal transmission within the family. Studies of mutans Streptococci also show extensive genetic heterogeneity and show vertical transmission of a predominant clonal type only from mother to infant, but not from father to infant. Studies of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans show considerable genetic heterogeneity among monkey isolates. Thus far, three clonal types have been reported with DNA fingerprinting among isolates from periodontal patients, but additional genetic heterogeneity can be found using specific DNA fragments as probes in hybridization experiments. Intrafamilial transmission of A. actinomycetemcomitans has been demonstrated. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis shows extensive genetic heterogeneity and case reports suggest clonal infection of any one individual. In contrast, results with DNA fingerprinting of Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides intermedius show that individuals may be infected with 2 or more clonal types. These studies point to the great potential of DNA fingerprinting for investigating the epidemiology of putative orofacial pathogens. Such studies with periodontal microorganisms will likely reveal steps in the acquisition, intraoral and person-to-person transmission, which then could possibly be inhibited or interfered with to prevent periodontal disease or its recurrence.
TI  - Identification of components in Fusobacterium nucleatum chemostat-culture supernatants that are potent inhibitors of human gingival fibroblast proliferation.
AB  - The present investigation concerned the effect of chemostat-culture cell-free supernatants of Fusobacterium nucleatum on the growth and synthetic activity of human gingival fibroblasts in vitro. Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured in fetal calf serum supplemented Dulbecco-Vogt medium containing various dilutions of conditioned or unconditioned bacterial culture medium. Cell proliferation was monitored by assessing cell growth over 5 days or incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA. Protein and proteoglycan synthesis were monitored by the incorporation of [3H]-proline and [35S]-sulfate, respectively, into macromolecules. While the conditioned culture medium caused a complete inhibition of cell growth and incorporation of [3H]-thymidine DNA, there was no discernible effect on protein or proteoglycan synthesis. This indicated that the cells remained viable yet unable to divide. Such a view was supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect was reversible upon removal of the conditioned medium. This activity had a molecular size less than 30,000, was heat-stable and nonvolatile. Chemical analysis of the conditioned bacterial culture supernatants indicated that high proportions of butyrate, ammonium, and acetate were present. When these components were added to unconditioned medium and tested, most of the inhibitory activity could be attributed to ammonium and butyrate. Since many bacteria which constitute the subgingival microflora release ammonium and butyrate, a very high concentration of these metabolites may well accumulate. Clearly, the potential for inhibition of fibroblast proliferation has ramifications related to diminished tissue repair following bacterially-induced periodontal destruction.
TI  - Isolation and identification of bacteria from subgingival plaque with low susceptibility to minocycline.
AB  - Twenty subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were screened for the presence of three periodontal 'pathogens'--Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens. Nineteen of the samples were found to contain at least one of the three organisms and six samples contained all three. The subgingival plaque samples were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of minocycline, and those organisms which appeared to be least susceptible to the antibiotic were isolated and identified. A total of 40 isolates were obtained and these consisted of 18 different species, only one of which, Fusobacterium nucleatum, is generally recognized as being associated with chronic periodontitis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of minocycline for many of the organisms isolated were greater than the concentration of attainable in gingival crevicular fluid following routine parenteral administration of the antibiotic.
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of members of the genus Fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus Fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of these organisms. The sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. The four species Fusobacterium nucleatum (including F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "F. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), Fusobacterium alocis, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium, and Fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did the two species Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Fusobacterium russii and Fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. The sequence data are discussed in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.
TI  - Isolation, purification and characterisation of 2-oxoglutarate reductase from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - 2-Oxoglutarate reductase from Fusobacterium nucleatum was isolated by thiol-disulphide interchange covalent chromatography. The enzyme was purified approximately 4000-fold and had a molecular mass of 68 kDa. The Michaelis constants for 2-oxoglutarate and NADH were 6.4 x 10(-5) and 0.4 x 10(-5), respectively. The involvement of sulphahydryl groups in catalysis was shown from the inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate reduction in the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl disulphide and reactivation with 2-mercaptoethanol. Allosteric effectors did not alter the rate of the reaction, or the enzyme stability. With the exception of 2-oxoglutarate, none of the other oxo-acids such as oxaloacetate, pyruvate, 2-oxobutyrate and glyoxylate were reduced. Although 2-oxoglutarate oxidised NADPH to a limited extent (3%), the enzyme was almost entirely specific towards NADH. 2-Oxoglutarate reductase was stable at 45 degrees C for 10 min, while incubation at 60 degrees C abolished all activity.
TI  - Reactivity of IgG from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  - The presence of IgG in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. The purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of IgG from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. A dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was used to demonstrate the presence of IgG in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. The percentages of reactivity by dot-ELISA follow: Bacteroides intermedius (84%), B. buccae (12%), Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), P. endodontalis (58%), P. asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus micros (44%), P. anaerobius (26%), Eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and Actinomyces israelii (6%). At least one of the three species of B. intermedius, P. gingivalis, or P. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-ELISA with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. A lack of cross reactivity of IgG in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented Bacteroides/Porphyromonas by dot-ELISA.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the uterus of cows after calving on two hygienically contrasting farms.
AB  - Intrauterine swabs were obtained from cows after calving on two commercial dairy  herds with contrasting hygienic environments and incidence of leucorrhea, and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Of 26 cows with a normal calving and puerperium, eight of 14 (57 per cent) were sterile on farm B where hygiene was poor, compared with five of 12 (42 per cent) on farm A where hygiene was better. Two cows on farm B retained their placentas and subsequently developed metritis/endometritis. Actinomyces pyogenes was the commonest bacterial isolate and Fusobacterium nucleatum, Proteus mirabilis and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were also frequently observed. Similar isolates were obtained from cows on farm B with parturient or puerperal disorders. The contrasting hygienic environments had no influence on either the quantitative or qualitative uterine bacterial flora. Thus, the difference in the incidence of endometritis must have been due to factors other than hygiene.
TI  - Specificity of antibodies present in human periapical lesions.
AB  - Various classes of immunoglobulins have been found in human periapical lesions. The specificity of secreted antibodies against antigens egressing from the root canal system has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to test the specificity of antibodies present in human periapical lesions. Human periapical biopsies were removed and cultured as organ culture explants. Antibodies present in the lesions were extracted in the cell culture fluids. A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the presence, type, and concentration of different classes of antibodies against a number of commonly found bacterial species present in the root canal system. The data show the presence of specific antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) against all 16 microorganisms tested. Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces israelii, Staphylococcus intermedius, and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced significantly high levels of IgG antibodies in these lesions.
TI  - A heat stable hemagglutinating activity of Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - Strains of Eikenella corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were shown to possess  lectinlike attachment factors. The present investigators found that E. corrodens has a heat stable factor which agglutinates sheep, mouse, and human erythrocytes. The activity is not abolished by additions of galactose or lactose. Lipopolysaccharide preparations from E. corrodens strains possessed strong hemagglutinating activity. LPSs of F. nucleatum did not agglutinate any erythrocytes tested. SDS-PAGE patterns stained with silver stain revealed that the LPSs of E. corrodens strains were rough type and those of F. nucleatum were wild type. The heat stable hemagglutinating activity of E. corrodens strains might be caused the rough type LPS of the cells.
TI  - Pathways of glutamate catabolism among Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Glutamate is a major source of energy for Fusobacterium species but its mode of catabolism has not hitherto been elucidated. Cell suspensions of F. nucleatum and F. varium, as representative species from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, respectively, both decarboxylated position-labelled glutamate but by different pathways. 14CO2 was released only from C-5 by F. nucleatum whereas F. varium decarboxylated glutamate at either C-1 or C-5. In both species, 2 mols of glutamate fermented yielded 2 mols of acetate and 1 mol of butyrate, suggesting the possibility of three metabolic pathways: the 2-oxoglutarate, mesaconate and 4-aminobutyrate pathways. Enzymes representative of the three pathways were assayed for in cell-free extracts of fusobacteria. All species tested possessed high levels of both glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase, indicating the presence of the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. Enzymes representative of the mesaconate pathway were detected in F. sulci, F. ulcerans, F. mortiferum and F. varium, while the latter two species also possessed the 4-aminobutyrate pathway. The pathways of glutamate catabolism therefore bore no relationship to the site of isolation of the fusobacteria tested but instead correlated with their chemotaxonomic properties. Thus, F. varium, F. mortiferum, F. ulcerans and F. sulci, which possess a peptidoglycan structure based on diaminopimelic acid, have either two or three pathways for glutamate catabolism whereas F. nucleatum and other species that have a lanthionine-based murein metabolized glutamate solely by the 2-oxoglutarate pathway.
TI  - Amoxycillin with clavulanic acid and tetracycline in periodontal therapy.
AB  - The effects of tetracycline and amoxycillin with clavulanic acid on the clinical  parameters and subgingival flora of eight patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis was assessed. Subjects received either tetracycline 250 mg four times daily or amoxycillin 250 mg with clavulanic acid 125 mg three times daily for a period of 2 weeks together with subgingival scaling and root planning. Both treatment regimens produced significant reductions in bleeding on probing and probing pocket depths which were still present 16 weeks after the antibiotic therapy. A significant reduction in the mean percentage of black-pigmented Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum and anaerobic corroding bacilli was also obtained. Both treatment regimens were equally effective in reducing the clinical parameter and altering the subgingival flora. The MIC values for Bacteroides gingivalis (Porphyromonas gingivalis). Bacteroides intermedius (Prevotella intermedia) and F. nucleatum to amoxycillin with clavulanic acid remained constant throughout the period of investigation. The MIC values of these organisms to tetracycline increased.
TI  - DNA probe detection of Eikenella corrodens, Wolinella recta and Fusobacterium nucleatum in subgingival plaque.
AB  - This cross-sectional study used species-specific DNA probes to examine subgingival plaque specimens for the presence of Eikenella corrodens, Wolinella recta, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in adults with untreated periodontitis or gingivitis and in healthy controls. W. recta and F. nucleatum were more prevalent in diseased sites from the periodontitis group when compared with the controls (81% vs 22% and 83% vs 20% respectively). E. corrodens was detected in 62% of the control sites and 81% of the periodontitis sites. Because the control sites commonly contained this organism, E. corrodens may not be useful in differentiating between health and disease. In addition, the relationship between the prevalence of W. recta and F. nucleatum and the prevalence of the established periodontal pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius and Bacteroides gingivalis, was examined. Positive detection of W. recta and F. nucleatum correlated closely with the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius and B. gingivalis. Therefore, W. recta and F. nucleatum do not appear to be unique indicators of periodontal disease.
TI  - [Right-sided endocarditis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum].
AB  - We present 1 case of right sided endocarditis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in a patient with intravenous drug addiction and human immunodeficiency. The clinical features were fever, anemia, and pulmonary embolism. The echocardiogram showed a giant vegetation originated from the right atrial wall prolapsing in diastole into the right ventricle which disappeared after the patient presented pulmonary embolism. The clinical course was uncontrolled with empiric antimicrobial therapy but it was good with metronidazol. The cases previously described in the literature caused by gram-negative anaerobic bacteria are discussed and compared with the present case.
TI  - A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of doxycycline: effect on the microflora of recurrent periodontitis lesions in high risk patients.
AB  - Twenty-seven patients with a recent history of periodontal abscesses and/or loss  of gingival attachment level (GAL) despite active periodontal therapy were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical measurements and subgingival scaling were performed every 2 months. When a site exhibited greater than or equal to 2 mm loss of GAL or a periodontal abscess, patients were administered either doxycycline at a dosage of 200 mg to start and 100 mg per day for 3 weeks, or a placebo. Clinical measurements of GAL and microbial analysis of subgingival plaque at study and control sites were made at the time of active disease and at intervals of 1 week and 7 months after completion of the drug regime. Plaque samples were screened for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Bacteroides intermedius (Bi), Eikenella corrodens (Ec) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) by indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique and for spirochetes (Sp) using Ryu's stain. Based on presence or absence analysis of the sum scores of the 6 pathogens, both the placebo (n = 10) and the doxycycline groups (n = 17) exhibited similar scores at the time of detection of active disease (mean placebo = 2.38 +/- 0.32; mean doxycycline = 2.95 +/- 0.27; P = 0.18). One week after treatment, the probability of detection was unchanged in the placebo group (mean placebo = 3.14 +/- 0.47), but was significantly reduced in the doxycycline group (mean doxycycline = 1.77 +/- 0.26; P = 0.0002). Study (active) sites exhibited scores 2 to 3 times higher than control (inactive) sites before doxycycline treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  - Media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. The bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. A similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. In all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. It is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.
TI  - Synergistic effect on blastogenesis in murine spleen cells of lipopolysaccharide, lipid A, and acid-degraded polysaccharide from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Interchangeable combinations of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with its split products by acetic acid hydrolysis, i.e. lipid A (LA) and degraded polysaccharide (PS), amplified the blastogenic response in murine spleen cell cultures as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake. Athymic murine spleen cells precultured with LPS-Fev1 for 48 h (stage 1), washed twice and cultured together with fresh cells and either LA or PS for 72 h (stage 2) gave a synergistic response over that found in spleen cell cultures of thymic mice. Spleen cells pre-cultured with LA or PS and with fresh cells and LPS-Fev1 added to stage 2 cultures gave less significant amplification compared with precultures of LPS and either LA or PS together with fresh cells added to stage 2. Precultures with LA, PS or LPS-Fev1 and with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and fresh cells added produced an additional increment of synergy which was most pronounced in spleen cell cultures of normal mice.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a 65-kilodalton diisopropylfluorophosphate-binding protein in the outer membrane of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1.
AB  - A 65-kilodalton protein was identified in the outer membrane of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 by SDS-PAGE. The relative amount of the protein varied during growth, being greatest in stationary phase. The protein was radio-labeled by [125I]-lactoperoxidase treatment of live cells and was only partially extractable with 2% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) at room temperature, and therefore assumed to be both exposed to the cell surface and peptidoglycan associated. In intact cells the protein bound diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), indicating that it may be a serine protease. DFP-binding activity depended apparently on proper localization of the proteins in the membrane. Several methods were tried in attempts to purify the 65-kilodalton protein; the method that gave best results was preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric point was determined to about pH 5. Amino acid composition analysis showed that the 65-kilodalton protein possesses an excess of hydrophilic over hydrophobic residues, polarity index 52%. The N-terminal end of the protein was apparently blocked.
TI  - Identification, and susceptibility to seven antimicrobial agents, of 61 gram-negative anaerobic rods from periodontal pockets.
AB  - Sixty-one cultures of Gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from deep periodontal pockets of patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis. Isolates were speciated as Bacteroides gingivalis (18 isolates), Bacteroides intermedius (8), Bacteroides oris (1), Bacteroides gracilis (17) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (17). Their susceptibilities, to seven antimicrobial agents, were determined in vitro using a plate dilution technique. Amoxycillin and amoxycillin with clavulanic acid were active against all isolates (MIC less than 1 mg/l) and proved the most effective agents tested. F. nucleatum and B. gracilis showed resistance to erythromycin; F. nucleatum had MIC values ranging from 0.03 mg/l up to 128 mg/l when tested with this, least effective agent. Metronidazole was effective against all isolates except for a few strains of B. gracilis (MIC less than 4 mg/l). Tetracycline hydrochloride and minocycline were active against all isolates except for a few strains of B. gracilis (MIC less than 2 mg/l with both minocycline and tetracycline hydrochloride). Penicillin proved less effective than amoxycillin with regard to inhibition of B. gracilis.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  - Animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. The rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. Furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues with ligatures. Experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. Studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. Studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. However, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. In the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.
TI  - Peptidoglycan precursor from Fusobacterium nucleatum contains lanthionine.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum was grown in the presence of [14C]UDP. By means of sequential precipitation and chromatographic separation of the cytoplasmic content, a peptidoglycan [14C]UDP pentapeptide containing lanthionine was isolated. This finding indicates that lanthionine is synthesized and incorporated as such during the assembly of the peptidoglycan.
TI  - Modeling bacterial damage to pulpal cells in vitro.
AB  - There is increasing evidence that access to patent dentinal tubules by bacteria and their products rather than trauma from restorative materials is responsible for subsequent pulpitides. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative cytotoxicity of centrifugal fractions of two bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola, on L929 cells in monolayer cultures and in the "in vitro pulp chamber." Neutrophilic chemotaxis assays and Limmulus assays were performed to verify biological activity of the various fractions of these bacteria. It was found that T. denticola inhibits new protein synthesis in cultured cells to a much greater extent than F. nucleatum, but that only F. nucleatum fractions are chemoattractive for human neutrophils in the absence of serum. While the chemical nature and molecular weights of the "toxic" materials were not determined, it appeared that eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibition caused by the T. denticola pellet fraction in the in vitro pulp chamber was at least 1000 times less than that caused by the same concentrations in monolayer cultures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of flurbiprofen and ibuprofen in vitro against six common  periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen and ibuprofen,  have been shown to inhibit the inflammation and alveolar bone loss associated with chronic destructive periodontal disease. However, the direct effect of NSAIDs on the gingival crevice microflora has not been studied. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen and flurbiprofen in vitro on six commonly isolated periodontal pathogens. The bacterial strains evaluated were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Wolinella recta. Pure cultures of these organisms were inoculated into broth, allowed to grow and inoculated again into sheep blood agar plates. For preliminary dose-response studies, antibiotic sensitivity blank disks loaded with 10 microliters of flurbiprofen 250 micrograms, 50 micrograms and 5 micrograms, or ibuprofen 500 micrograms, 50 micrograms and 5 micrograms were placed on the seeded agar plates. Clindamycin 2 micrograms disks were used as positive controls and discs loaded with only drug vehicle served as negative controls. In an attempt to estimate the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these NSAIDs on specific microorganisms, additional experiments employing intermediate drug dosages were also performed. Clindamycin produced large zones of inhibition for all bacterial strains except for Eikenella corrodens which is known to be resistant to the antibiotic and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which appeared to be only moderately sensitive to the antibiotic. Zones of inhibition were not produced by any of the negative control disks or by the 5 micrograms or 50 micrograms doses of either NSAID.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Subgingival microflora in children of early childhood, school age and circumpuberty. The proportion and frequency of gram-negative bacteria in periodontally healthy and gingivitis groups].
AB  - The present study characterized the microbial profiles of the gingival sulci in children. Subgingival samples from 36 gingivitis lesions of 18 patients and 36 sites in 18 healthy persons were examined. The tested individuals were divided into three stages according to physiological maturation i.e. early childhood, school age, circumpuberty. Puberty was confirmed through examination of wrist radiographs. Using continuous anaerobic techniques, samples were dispersed, diluted and then inoculated on selective and nonselective media and cultured under the condition appropriate gaseous phase respectively. Isolates were identified microbiologically and counted. All values were evaluated statistically. The samples were simultaneously examined by dark-field microscopy. Changes in the proportions and the frequency of periodontophathic bacteria were distinct in different stages of physiological maturation. Black-pigmented Bacteroides species were commonly found in gingivitis lesions. Bacteroides intermedius was frequently detected in the subgingival samples from children with gingivitis. In all stages, the proportion of black-pigmented Bacteroides and B. intermedius in the gingivitis groups were found to be significantly higher than that of the healthy groups. Statistical analysis revealed that levels of B. intermedius increased in circumpuberty stage compared with the 2 younger stages. Black-pigmented Bacteroides and B. intermedius were closely related to GI, PlI in 3 stages. Bacteroides gingivalis was found only in two gingivitis sites of a circumpubertal child with gingivitis. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 4 out of 12 sites in the school age group, and in 6 out of 12 sites in the circumpuberty group with gingivitis respectively. In the circumpuberty group, the proportion of A. actinomycetemcomitans in the gingivitis group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was closely related to GI, PlI, CI, PPD. Eikenella corrodens was found to be associated with gingivitis in the school age and circumpuberty groups. No correlation was found in the detection of Fusobacterium nucleatum in 3 stages. Microscopic examination showed that the proportion of rods, fusiforms, filaments, motile rods, spirochetes in the gingivitis groups was significantly higher than that of the healthy groups, while the proportion of cocci in gingivitis groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy groups in 3 stages. Spirochetes were closely related to GI, PlI, PPD in all stages.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of the Epstein-Barr virus-inducing properties of short-chain fatty acids present in the culture fluids of oral bacteria.
AB  - The culture fluids of various anaerobic bacteria induced the synthesis of early antigens (EA) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying lymphoblastoid cells. The culture fluids of Corynebacterium butyricum and Fusobacterium nucleatum were the effective inducer on EA. The inducing activity was, to some extent, dependent on their n-butyric acid content, but appeared to be regulated by yet unidentified materials.
TI  - Associations between six DNA probe-detected periodontal bacteria and alveolar bone loss and other clinical signs of periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess the associations between the presence and amounts of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, B. intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, Wolinella recta, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in the periodontal pocket and the degree of alveolar bone loss and other clinical signs of periodonitis, such as probing pocket depth, attachment level, and presence of bleeding on probing at the same site. The study material comprised 16 subjects with or without approximal sites showing longitudinal alveolar bone loss who were selected from a group of 142 subjects monitored radiographically over the past 4 years. In this group 105 sites were examined, of which 58 showed recent alveolar bone loss greater than or equal to 1 mm. Subgingival plaque was collected with absorbent paper points and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes specific for the above-mentioned bacteria. The amount of each bacterial species was correlated with the degree of bone loss over time and the three clinical measurements by means of Spearman rank correlation. A. actinomycetemcomitans showed poor correlations with all three clinical signs of periodontal inflammation, whereas B. gingivalis and W. recta demonstrated significant positive correlations with the three clinical measurements and with attachment level and pocket depth, respectively. In addition, the amount of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. gingivalis and W. recta showed significant positive correlation with the extent of alveolar bone loss at the site. In contrast, the amounts of B. intermedius, E. corrodens, and F. nucleatum showed negative correlations with all four measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Candida isolates with bacteria from bone marrow transplant  recipients.
AB  - In vitro coaggregation between Candida species isolated from immunosuppressed bone marrow transplant recipients and oral bacteria was investigated. Each Candida strain showed a different pattern of coaggregation with the 22 bacterial strains studied. Two strains of Lactobacillus amylovorus isolated from separate bone marrow transplant patients and Fusobacterium nucleatum (VPI 10197) coaggregated with all Candida strains. Ten bacterial strains showed no coaggregation with the Candida strains. A variety of inhibition patterns were observed when coaggregating strains were first incubated with various sugars or subjected to heat treatment. Positive and negative results were generally consistent with all Candida strains. On the basis of the culture characteristics of the oral rinse specimens, relationships between the colonization of bacteria and yeasts and in vitro coaggregation were suggested.
TI  - A family study of a mother and daughter with increased susceptibility to early-onset periodontitis: microbiological, immunological, host defensive, and genetic analyses.
AB  - Microbiological, immunological, host-defensive, and genetic analyses were performed on a mother and daughter, both of whom had early-onset periodontitis (rapidly progressive periodontitis in the mother; localized juvenile periodontitis in the daughter). Microscopic examination revealed a greatly elevated percentage of rod-form bacteria in both subjects. Fusobacterium sp. and Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly Bacteroides gingivalis) were the predominant microorganisms cultured. The humoral immune responses to F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were much higher in both subjects than those to any other periodontal bacteria examined. Functional and phenotypic analysis of the peripheral lymphocytes showed no significant abnormalities. However, investigation of neutrophil function showed that the mother had depressed neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production. The daughter had depression not only of chemotaxis and superoxide production, but also of neutrophil phagocytosis. Serological typing of HLA antigens revealed the same Class II HLA profile in both subjects. It was concluded that both subjects very probably had an identical condition and that these patients provided a unique model for improving our understanding of the host factors involved in periodontal disease.
TI  - Distribution and frequency of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies in the human oral cavity.
AB  - Three reference strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 32 human oral isolates were compared by a variety of physiological tests, enzyme electrophoretic profiles, SDS-PAGE patterns, DNA base composition and hybridization to test their possible site specificity and frequency of the recently described subspecies of F. nucleatum. Nine of the 11 isolates assigned to F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum were from diseased sites, whereas isolates from healthy sites were all identified as F. nucleatum subspecies polymorphum or F. nucleatum subspecies fusiforme. Strains of the latter subspecies were the least frequently isolated (2 of 32). These results, although still inconclusive because of the relatively small sample size, nevertheless confirmed the heterogeneity of F. nucleatum and indicate that most human oral isolates from subgingival sites probably belong to F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum.
TI  - Interaction of Fusobacterium nucleatum 191 with human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is frequently isolated in high numbers from the subgingival plaque of patients with periodontal diseases. Adherence of these bacteria to several host tissues is lectin-like in that it is inhibited by galactose, lactose, and N-acetyl-galactosamine. Since F. nucleatum has the capacity to activate human peripheral blood lymphocytes, the purpose of this study was to determine whether F. nucleatum adheres to lymphocytes and, if so, to determine whether lectin-like interactions facilitate lymphocyte activation. Adherence of F. nucleatum strain 191 to lymphocytes was confirmed by agglutination assays, scanning electron microscopy, and by using fluorescein- or [3H]-labeled bacteria. Saturation of adherence was reached at about 35 bacteria per lymphocyte. F. nucleatum adhered to greater than 90% of the lymphocytes, and adhered in higher numbers to B cell-enriched subpopulations than to T cell-enriched subpopulations. Adherence was inhibited by N-acetyl-galactosamine, lactose greater than galactose, alpha- and beta-methyl galactoside, but not by 100 mM glucose, mannose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, or other sugars tested. Lymphocytes underwent mitogenesis when preincubated with bacteria and washed to remove weakly adherent and non-adherent bacteria. Mitogenesis induced by low concentrations of F. nucleatum was reduced, but not completely eliminated, by N-acetyl-galactosamine. However, N-acetyl-galactosamine had no effect on mitogenesis induced by preincubation with high concentrations of bacteria. These results suggest that adherence of F. nucleatum facilitates activation of lymphocytes, particularly at low concentrations of bacteria.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Microbial patterns in pooled subgingival plaque samples from young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. In the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. From 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. The proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented Bacteroides sp., B. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella sp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter sp., and Candida sp. Spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. Calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. The spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all individuals.
TI  - Regulation of fructose metabolism and polymer synthesis by Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.
AB  - Energy for the anaerobic growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 can be derived from the fermentation of sugar (fructose) or amino acid (glutamate). During growth on fructose, the cells formed large intracellular granules which after extraction yielded glucose by either acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. The endogenous polymer was subsequently metabolized, and after overnight incubation of the cells in buffer, the glucan granules were no longer detectable by electron microscopy. Anaerobically, washed cells grown previously on fructose fermented this sugar to a mixture of lactic, acetic, and butyric acids, and little intracellular glucan was formed. Aerobically, the cells slowly metabolized fructose to acetate. Provision of glutamic acid as an additional energy (ATP) source elicited rapid synthesis of polymer by glycolyzing cells. Intracellular granules were not present in glutamate-grown cells, and under anaerobic conditions, the resting cells failed to metabolize [14C] fructose. However, the addition of glutamic acid to the suspension resulted in the rapid accumulation of sugar by the cells. Approximately 15% of the 14C-labeled material was extractable with boiling water, and by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this phosphorylated derivative was identified as [14C]fructose-1-phosphate. The nonextractable material represented [14C]glucan polymer. Fructose-1-phosphate kinase activity in fructose-grown cells was fivefold greater than that in glutamate-grown cells. We suggest that the activity of fructose-1-phosphate kinase and the availability of ATP regulate the flow of fructose into either the glycolytic or polymer-synthesizing pathway in F. nucleatum.
TI  - Monoclonal antibody-coated latex agglutination assay for identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to lipopolysaccharide of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4 (serotype b) and eight MAbs to a serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen of strain Y4 were obtained. Latex particles sensitized with an MAb to the Y4 lipopolysaccharide produced a positive agglutination with whole cells of all three serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but not with Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, "Bacteroides" intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli. On the other hand, latex particles sensitized with an MAb to the serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen agglutinated with whole cells of serotype b A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, but not with heated and trypsinized cells of P. gingivalis. The simple and rapid latex agglutination assay using MAbs may be useful for the identification of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Recolonization of the subgingival microflora after scaling and root planing in human periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the recolonization patterns of the subgingival microflora of adult periodontitis patients after a single session of scaling and root planing. In each of eight patients, three clinically diseased sites were investigated microbiologically by darkfield microscopy and cultural analysis. After initial clinical and microbiological parameters were determined, each subject received a single session of scaling and root planing but no oral hygiene instructions. Clinical indices were measured and microbial parameters were reassessed 7, 21, and 60 days after treatment in a manner such that each of the test sites was sampled only once after treatment. Recolonization was evaluated by matching any single site with its own preoperative site. A significant improvement in probing depth was noted for up to 60 days after treatment, while the gingival index did not change markedly during the course of the study. The microbial composition of treated sites 7 days after scaling and root planing, as determined by both cultural and darkfield data, was similar to that of periodontally healthy sites. Differences between cultural and darkfield data became apparent at the 21 day sampling point. The darkfield data showed that the sites consisted of cocci with few spirochetes. Cultural data demonstrated that the majority of the cocci were anaerobic, namely Streptococcus intermedius, Veillonella parvula, and Peptostreptococcus micros. At 60 days, there was no significant variation in any of the parameters from pretreatment levels. The most prevalent anaerobic rods prior to and 60 days after therapy were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis, and B. intermedius.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Plaque and chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. A question of ecology.
AB  - The nature of the relationship between dental plaque and chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD) remains unclear, although there is no doubt that plaque is the direct cause. Non-specific, specific and exogenous hypotheses have been proposed to explain plaque-host relationships. Current evidence indicates that plaque is part of the natural human microflora, one of many such in nature, and that disruption of oral microbial ecology, due primarily to diet texture changes, leads to gingivitis and periodontitis. These result in increased plaque accumulation, and particularly in increased interdental effective plaque thickness. The latter leads to alterations in plaque ecology, particularly increasing anaerobiosis, with resultant shifts in proportions of its constituent species. These shifts are responsible for the increased counts of, for example, Bacteroides gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Wolinella recta, spirochaetes and others, associated with chronic periodontitis in its various forms. Measures to prevent or control chronic periodontitis should aim, not to eliminate plaque, which ignores ecology and would compromise host defence, but to restore the species distribution in plaque to that compatible with health.
TI  - The RNA polymerases of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Western blot analysis that used antisera to the E. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the RNA polymerase of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Both antisera reacted with proteins in A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. mutans whole-cell extracts. Reactions were seen with some F. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core RNA polymerase antisera were used, but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. No reaction with F. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to E. coli sigma factor. There were no cross-reacting proteins detected in P. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. These results suggest that E. coli RNA polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase for E. coli RNA polymerase to recognize P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum promoters. Partially purified P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase exhibited a specificity for a P. gingivalis DNA template, while having a decreased activity from an E. coli DNA template. The antibiotic sensitivity profile of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of E. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. We conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum genes in E. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
TI  - Transferable Tet M in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Two tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum strains were able to transfer, by conjugation, tetracycline resistance and the Tet M determinant to recipient F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Enterococcus faecalis strains at a frequency of 10(-1) to 10(-8).
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  - A total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. Ninety-five percent of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2% w/v). Phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as Bacterodides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Wolinella recta. Addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. For most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. These results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.
TI  - Ingestion of Bacteroides buccae, Bacteroides oris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and  Fusobacterium nucleatum by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro.
AB  - The phagocytic ingestion of clinical isolates and reference strains of Bacteroides buccae, Bacteroides oris, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was studied. Special attention was focused on the hydrophobicity of the strains. B. buccae strains, less or equally hydrophobic than PMNs, were poorly ingested without opsonization. Hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, strains of B. oris and both hydrophilic and hydrophobic P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum strains were readily ingested without opsonization. Hydrophobicity thus contributes to the adherence of bacteria to PMNs in some, but not all, species tested. Normal human serum enhanced the ingestion of B. buccae, but failed to do so after heat-inactivation. Heat-inactivation of the immune serum to B. buccae strain ES57 did not reduce opsonic activity suggesting that specific antibodies enhanced the ingestion of B. buccae.
TI  - The relationship of serum IgG antibody titers to periodontal pathogens to indicators of the host response in crevicular fluid.
AB  - In this study; the relationship of indicators of the local host response in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) to the serum antibody titer to periodontal pathogens was examined. 15 patients with chronic adult periodontitis were studied. GCF was collected and analyzed for the total amount of IgG, IgM, the lysosomal enzyme B-glucuronidase (BG) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). At the same examination, serum from these patients was collected, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used to determine the serum IgG antibody titer to a panel of 17 periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3 strains), Bacteroides gingivalis (4), Eikenella corrodens (2), Wolinella recta, Bacteroides intermedius (3), Fusobacterium nucleatum, and 3 Capnocytophaga species). Using Spearman rank order correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated to relate the 4 indicators of host response in GCF to the serum IgG antibody titer to each of the 17 micro-organisms. The mean correlation between total IgG in GCF and the serum IgG antibody titer was positive (r = +0.30), and statistically significant correlations between total IgG in GCF and serum IgG antibody titer were observed for one strain of B. intermedius and C. ochracea. A weaker positive correlation was observed for IgM (r = 0.18). In contrast, the mean correlation between total BG in GCF and the serum antibody titer was negative (r = -0.34). Statistically significant negative correlations were observed for all 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, one strain of E. corrodens and W. recta. The mean correlation for alpha 2M was r = -0.06. These data suggest that elevated BG activity in GCF, believed to be a marker for lysosomal enzyme released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the crevicular environment, may be associated with a reduced serum IgG antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens. Furthermore, these findings imply that the development of a serum IgG antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens is consistent with a protective host response.
TI  - Serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how serum antibodies reactive with periodontitis-associated bacteria with relates to the diagnosis of periodontitis subjects. Study groups included localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) subjects, severe periodontitis (SP) subjects, chronic adult periodontitis (AP) subjects, and age matched controls. Twenty-two bacterial strains, representing 18 different species most commonly found in early onset periodontitis were evaluated using serum from LJP, SP, and age matched controls. Serum IgG reactive with these organisms was determined using a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Serum antibody reactive with 13 bacterial strains differed significantly (P less than 0.01) between the three clinical groups. Discriminate analysis revealed that antibodies reactive with 5 bacterial strains of the 13 were able to identify the clinical group to which subjects belonged 79% of the time with control subjects being correctly identified 100% of the time, LJP subjects 78% of the time, and SP subjects 60% of the time. These strains included two strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Y4 and N27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (E1D1), Eubacterium brachy, and Bacteroides gingivalis. The low classification rate of SP subjects suggested heterogeneity. The SP group could be divided into three subgroups using the serological data. One subgroup, with "super" severe attachment loss, generally lacked antibody reactive with these five organisms, another subgroup was serologically similar to LJP subjects, while the third subgroup had antibodies to additional organisms. This suggests that some SP subjects may represent a more advanced form of LJP. Comparison of antibody reactivity of AP subjects with age matched controls to 23 bacterial types revealed that mean serum antibody reactivity to only Bacteroides gingivalis was higher in AP subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical and microbial evaluation of treatment regimens to reduce denture stomatitis.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of an antimicrobial mouthrinse, denture soft relines, and a placebo rinse on the clinical findings and microbial flora of 78 patients with denture stomatitis. For 28 days the study and control groups performed oral rinses and denture soaks. Reline group patients had maxillary denture soft relines that were changed every 7 days. At the end of the study, the mean severity of denture stomatitis was significantly less in the groups that used the study rinse (P less than 0.01) and received denture relines (P less than 0.05) compared to the control. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in ranked adjusted percentage counts in two out of 13 denture plaque organisms investigated (Fusobacterium nucleatum [P less than 0.05] and total Bacteroides [P less than 0.05]), with the antiseptic rinse producing the lowest count. Yeast populations were reduced, but not significantly (P = 0.07). In the absence of other mechanical denture hygiene procedures, the antiseptic rinse and relines were equally effective in reducing denture stomatitis and potential pathogens of denture plaque flora.
TI  - [Ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
AB  - This study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. Bacterial strains used in this study, were Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10557 and Streptococcus mutans OMZ 176. The bacterial cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-K1, L-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (N2: 80%, CO2: 10%, H2: 10%). The effect of environmental Eh and pH on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and Eh and pH tolerance tests were also undertaken. The environmental pH decreased from pH 7.0 to pH 4.9 accompanied with the growth of S. mutans OMZ 176 and S. sanguis ATCC 10557 in both single and mixed culture. The environmental Eh increased from -308 mV to -180 mV accompanied with the growth of S. sanguis ATCC 10557. The growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 and P. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with Eh and pH. Especially, the growth of P. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below pH 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 was strongly inhibited at Eh -100 mV in an Eh tolerance test. The oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of S. sanguis ATCC 10557. Therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by S. sanguis ATCC 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. These results suggest that the high Eh and the low pH generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.
TI  - Growth conditions and outer membrane proteins of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum strains ATCC 10953, ATCC 25586, F1 F3, F6, and Fev1 were  grown in different media. The influence of growth conditions on the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). There were no apparent differences in the outer membrane protein profiles when cells in the same phase of growth in various rich media were compared. Differences, however, were observed between early logarithmic phase and stationary phase cells. Thus several proteins were only synthesized during late logarithmic and stationary phase. Synthesis of some of these proteins, in particular a 65K and a 14K protein, seemed to depend on the presence of peptides in the medium. In a complete medium, these proteins were synthesized after depletion of some amino acids, and peptides were then utilized.
TI  - Amino acid utilization by Fusobacterium nucleatum grown in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - The present investigation evaluated amino acid utilization by 120 strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum in a chemically defined medium and attempted to relate the patterns to 3 proposed subspecies of F. nucleatum. Strains were inoculated into a chemically defined medium, with and without 2 g/l glucose, consisting of 14 inorganic salts, 21 amino acids, 23 vitamins and cofactors, and 7 purines and pyrimidines. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the spent culture medium, as well as the uninoculated control medium, were analyzed for amino acid content by ion chromatography. Amino acid utilization was determined by the differences in concentrations of amino acids found in inoculated and uninoculated samples. If greater than 34% of the amino acid was removed from the medium, the amino acid was considered to be utilized. Of the 21 amino acids present in the chemically defined medium, 8 amino acids, lysine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, threonine, serine, glutamate and cysteine were consistently utilized. Four amino acids, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine and aspartate were utilized by some strains but not others. Nine amino acids, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, valine, phenylalanine, proline, ornithine, and arginine were not utilized by any of the strains. The utilization patterns did not relate to subspecies formed on the basis of SDS-PAGE and DNA hybridization.
TI  - Blastogenesis and polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis in murine spleen cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, lipid A and acid-degraded polysaccharide from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide of Fusobacterium nucleatum strain Fevl was split by acid hydrolysis. The split products, i.e. lipid A and degraded polysaccharide were mitogenic for murine spleen cells as measured by uptake of [3H]thymidine. The uptake of [3H]thymidine was dose-dependent. Incubation of spleen cells with stimulants for 3 days resulted in a polyclonal activation of immunoglobulin synthesis. Higher mitogenic response and immunoglobulin production were found in spleen cells of athymic mice compared to those of thymic mice. The activity of lipid A in stimulating immunoglobulin synthesis was comparable with the parent lipopolysaccharide-Fevl, the degraded polysaccharide being the less potent stimulator.
TI  - Binding specificity of Fusobacterium nucleatum to human erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, fibroblasts, and HeLa cells.
AB  - Eighteen strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum were studied with respect to their adherence to human erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, fibroblasts, and HeLa cells. Four types of adherence were found: 1) sugar-sensitive adherence 2) amino acid-sensitive adherence 3) unknown adherence 4) weak adherence. There was no obvious correlation between the patterns of hemagglutination and adherence to other cells. The results indicate not only a complex network of bacterial receptors on human cells, but also a variety of types of bacterial adherence as expressed by the selectivity of the bacterial binding to specific cell surfaces.
TI  - A rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The relationship between volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. VFAs were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates. The bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the VPI manual. Analysis of the direct VFA patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. The following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: Streptococcus intermedius in Group A, Peptostreptococcus micros in Group B, Fusobacterium nucleatum in Group C, Bacteroides gingivalis in Group D, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in Group E. The profile of VFAs produced in the PYG culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct VFA patterns. Agreement ratios between direct and PYG VFA patterns were as follows: Group A, 47.1%; Groups B and C, 45.0%; Group D, 87.5%; and Group E, 62.9%. The acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group B, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group C, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group E. In these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and PYG FVA pattern were high. In Group D, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. Efficiency rates of ABPC, PIPC, CCL, CEZ, CMZ, SBT/CPZ, JM, CLDM, MINO and GM were relatively low and resistant rates were high for the gram-negative rods.
TI  - Multiple periodontal abscesses after systemic antibiotic therapy.
AB  - Multiple periodontal abscesses were reported in medically compromised patients. We examined patients with a non-contributory medical history referred for the treatment of numerous periodontal abscesses. All patients had taken oral broad spectrum antibiotics 1 to 3 weeks prior to the outburst of the abscesses (8 patients: penicillin, 2 patients: tetracycline). The patients suffered from advanced periodontal disease, 82% of the examined sites showed probing depths greater than 3 mm, 56% attachment loss greater than 3 mm. Subgingival plaque samples were analysed from 2 different abscess sites. Bacteroides gingivalis (19/20), Fusobacterium nucleatum (13/20) and Streptococcus intermedius (13/20) were the most prevalent anaerobic microbiota. Strains resistant to the prescribed antibiotic were found in 55% (11/20) of the subgingival plaque samples. It was concluded that in patients with advanced periodontal disease, systemic antibiotic therapy without subgingival debridement may change the composition of the subgingival microbiota, thus favouring the outburst of multiple periodontal abscesses.
TI  - Susceptibility and resistance of plaque bacteria to minocycline.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 55 strains of subgingival plaque bacteria to minocycline was determined. A concentration of 1 microgram/ml minocycline was found to inhibit 85% of the strains tested and the MIC ranged from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml. For 71% of the strains tested the MBC was at least 4 times greater than the corresponding MIC, suggesting a bacteriostatic activity for minocycline. A concentration of 20 mg/ml of magnesium ions was capable of neutralizing 8 micrograms/ml of minocycline and was used to eliminate "carry-over" effects inherent in the experimental procedure. After 6 to 7 weeks exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of minocycline there was no appreciable increase in the MICs of most organisms with the exception of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 10981 and Campylobacter concisus NCTC 11485. Short term (6 hour exposure of bacteria to minocycline (8 micrograms/ml) markedly reduced the viability of a number of periodontopathogens but had little effect on the viability of Veillonella parvula NCTC 11456 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 11326. These in vitro investigations have demonstrated that minocycline is capable of inhibiting most of the periodontitis-associated bacteria tested and can kill some of these bacteria after a comparatively short exposure time. However, some of the organisms tested exhibited a low susceptibility to minocycline and others became less susceptible following exposure to low concentrations of the antibiotic for several weeks.
TI  - A longitudinal study of the cultivable subgingival anaerobic bacteria isolated from sheep during the development of broken mouth periodontitis.
AB  - In a longitudinal bacteriological study of the cultivable subgingival anaerobic flora isolated from developing broken mouth periodontitis in sheep, samples were taken from five sheep on each of three farms on seven occasions over a period of 2.5 years. Ten different bacterial genera were isolated regularly but with fluctuating frequencies. Bacteroides and Fusobacterium organisms accounted for nearly 70% of the isolates. The Bacteroides and Fusobacterium isolates studied in detail from one farm were identified to species level. The fusobacteria comprised F. nucleatum-like organisms (68.6%). F. necrophorum (29.6%) and F. naviforme (1.8%). The Bacteroides spp. were divided into 11 main groups and included black-pigmented species similar to B. asaccharolyticus and B. gingivalis. On the farm studied in detail, the sheep could be allocated to two groups according to progression of periodontal disease. Most of the B. gingivalis-like isolates were from sheep with actively progressing disease, indicating that this organism may play a role in periodontal destruction in sheep.
TI  - Serological investigation of refractory human adult periodontitis.
AB  - This study examined the difference between the serum antibody profiles in refractory adult periodontitis patients (group A), and compared to those (group B) who responded well to conventional periodontal treatment. The levels of specific IgG antibody to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusibacteriumnucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens were assessed in a group of 19 patients (group A) and 11 patients (group B). Specific IgG serum antibody levels were estimated using biotin-avidin linked immunosorbent assay (BALISA). Results indicated that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Bacteroides gingivalis had very high levels of specific circulating antibody in the sera of both groups of patients; whereas, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens showed considerable lower levels of antibody than the other two antigens. However, the differences between the two groups with regard to the antibody levels against different bacterial antigens were not statistically significant.
TI  - Characterization of the Tet M determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Veillonella parvula had DNA sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the Tet M transposon, Tn916. In contrast, Gardnerella vaginalis, commensal Neisseria spp., and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.
TI  - Growth stimulation of Treponema denticola by periodontal microorganisms.
AB  - Previous experiments have indicated that enrichment of subgingival plaque in human serum can lead to the accumulation of Treponema denticola. T. denticola depends on bacterial interactions for its growth in serum. Aim of the present study was to identify specific microorganisms involved in the growth stimulation of T. denticola. To this end, strains isolated from previous plaque enrichment cultures were tested for growth stimulation in co-cultures with T. denticola. In addition, growth of T. denticola was tested in culture filtrates of the same strains, Bacteroides intermedius, Eubacterium nodatum, Veillonella parvula and Fusobacterium nucleatum were found to enhance growth of T. denticola in co-cultures. A continuous co-culture of T. denticola, F. nucleatum and B. intermedius in human serum gave very high levels of T. denticola, up to 3.10(9).ml-1. Mechanisms involved in growth stimulation may include the ability of B. intermedius and E. nodatum to cleave the protein-core of serum (glyco-)proteins, making these molecules accessible for degradation by T. denticola. In addition, E. nodatum was found to produce a low-molecular weight growth-factor for T. denticola, that was heat-stable and acid as well as alkaline resistant. V. parvula may provide peptidase activities complementary to those of T. denticola. The nature of the growth enhancing activity of F. nucleatum is yet unknown. The data support the dependency of T. denticola on other bacterial species for growth in the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes for the identification of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were developed for identification of the periodontal  bacteria Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, B. intermedius types I and II, B. forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Wolinella recta. Probes were designed by sequencing the 16S rRNA for each bacterium, identifying hypervariable regions, and chemically synthesizing species-specific probes. These probes were specific when tested against a panel of nucleic acids from closely related bacteria.
TI  - The incidence of periodontopathic microorganisms in young children.
AB  - Thirty-six children in 4 cohorts of 0-1 week, 1-6 months, 1-2 years and 2-2 1/2 years of age were examined for the presence of black-pigmented Bacteroides species and some other bacteria suspected of being involved in the subsequent development of periodontal destruction. None of the sought-after bacteria were detected in the first week of life. Bacteroides intermedius and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were detected as early as 1 month after birth. Both of these bacteria were detected in 16-37% of children in the different cohorts. Bacteroides denticola was detected in one child. Other black-pigmented species including Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides loescheii were not detected. Eikenella corrodens was detected in 62% of children under 6 months. Capnocytophaga spp. were detected in 12% and Fusobacterium nucleatum in 25% of children in this age group. With increasing age there was a trend towards an increase in the number of children with F. nucleatum but other bacteria were detected in similar numbers of children throughout the 3 older cohorts. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected at any age.
TI  - Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, and blocked penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics through bacterial outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is production of beta-lactamases, which have been found in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium species. beta-Lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is commonly mediated by beta-lactamases that are mainly cephalosporinase in character. B. fragilis strains can also produce penicillinases and enzymes inactivating cefoxitin and imipenem. The non-fragilis species of Bacteroides produce beta-lactamases that are mainly penicillinase in character. Penicillinases are also isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium clostridioforme, and Clostridium ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.
TI  - Diisopropylfluorophosphate-binding proteins in the outer membrane of Fusobacterium nucleatum: strain variations.
AB  - Six strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum were tested for their ability to react with [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a serine protease inhibitor. Several cytoplasmic proteins were labelled but the strongest labelling was regularly observed in a few outer membrane proteins. The number and the molecular mass of the proteins detected varied according to the strain tested. A 61 kDa protein was labelled in all strains tested, including the two type strains ATCC 10953 and ATCC 25586. A 65 kDa protein was particularly strongly labelled in strains Fev1 and F6.
TI  - Capnophilic and anaerobic bacteremia in neutropenic patients: an oral source.
AB  - The currently accepted empiric antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in neutropenic patients may not cover the possibility of capnophilic and anaerobic bacteremia. Many of these infections develop in patients with severe mucositis or periodontitis, and the type of organisms recovered also suggests an oral source of infection. We present two cases of bacteremia in neutropenic patients who had been empirically treated with ceftazidime and piperacillin plus amikacin. In the first case a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated; in the second case bacteremia was due to a mixture of Leptotrichia buccalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. These observations emphasize the necessity for a reevaluation of the possible use of antimicrobial agents active against beta-lactamase-producing capnophilic organisms and anaerobic bacteria during empiric therapy in neutropenic patients with an oral source of infection.
TI  - The biotin-dependent sodium ion pump glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from Fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum). Comparison with the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Membrane preparations of Fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein). The enzyme was solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 in 0.5 M NaCl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-Sepharose. The activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on Na+ (Km = 3 mM) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. The glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria Acidaminococcus fermentans and Clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent Km for Na+ (1 mM) and were not stimulated by phospholipids. In addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium ion. By incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic sodium ion pump was reconstituted. The enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kDa), beta (33 kDa), gamma (19 kDa), and delta (16 kDa) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). The subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. With an antiserum directed against the decarboxylase from A. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus could be detected on Western blots.
TI  - Proposal of three subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum Knorr 1922: Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum subsp. nov., comb. nov.; Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum subsp. nov., nom. rev., comb. nov.; and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii subsp. nov., nom. rev., comb. nov.
AB  - Heterogeneity among isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum has been recognized for many years. The phenotypic properties of 340 strains considered to be F. nucleatum were examined. While these strains were phenotypically similar and fit the description of F. nucleatum, they could be differentiated into three groups on the basis of electrophoretic patterns of whole-cell proteins and DNA homology. Strains in groups I and II showed greater than 80% DNA homology within groups and less than 75% similarity between groups. Strains of group III demonstrated greater than 85% DNA homology to each other and less than 65% similarity to strains in groups I and II. We propose that Fusobacterium nucleatum be divided into the following three subspecies: Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, with type strain ATCC 25586; Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, with type strain ATCC 10953; and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii, with type strain ATCC 49256.
TI  - Role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  - Progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may frequently be involved. Such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. Hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. Adhesins of Actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in solution. Cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. Thus, several bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii and Bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase. Similarly, the adhesion of some Gram-negative bacteria, such as Bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. It seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.
TI  - Effects of periodontopathic bacteria on IL-1 and IL-1 inhibitor production by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - The effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and an IL-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN's) was examined. Peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the PMN's were separated using dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. The PMN's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. Four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; Bacteroides gingivalis FDC 381, Bacteroides forsythus FDC 338, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and Fusobacterium nucleatum FDC 263. The non-oral Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557 was used as a control organism. IL-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. The non-oral organism F. mortiferum stimulated IL-1 production by PMN's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated IL-1 release although the bacteria themselves had an IL-1 enhancing effect. Following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated PMN supernatants, an IL-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. These results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of PMN's and may also suggest a regulatory role for PMN's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a major outer-membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The major outer-membrane proteins of 40-41 kDa were identified by sodium dodecyl  sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in Fusobacterium nucleatum strains ATCC 10953, ATCC 25586, F3, F6 and Fev1. The proteins were purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. Their behaviour in gel filtration and gel electrophoresis, their sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes, and their amino acid composition were investigated. The purified proteins were partly sequenced from the N-terminal end. A 36.5 kDa portion was protected against extrinsic proteolytic (trypsin, chymotrypsin or pronase) digestion of whole cells. This polypeptide was isolated and partially sequenced from the N-terminal end. From these data and data from extrinsic iodination it was concluded that the N-terminal end of the protein is probably exposed on the surface of the cell. A database search revealed amino acid sequence similarity in an Ala-Pro-rich region of outer-membrane protein A (OmpA) in other Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Outer membrane proteins as major antigens of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The immunochemical reactions of rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed to different preparations of Fusobacterium nucleatum i.e, whole cells, peptidoglycan associated proteins, a peptidoglycan-protein complex and a purified 40 kiloDalton (kDa) protein, were investigated on outer membrane preparations of Fusobacterium species and a restricted number of Leptotrichia buccalis after their separation on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose. All F. nucleatum strains had identical reaction patterns with the immune sera tested. Surface exposed parts of a restricted number of proteins with apparent molecular weights at 70 kDa (a doublet band), 60 kDa, 55 kDa and 40 kDa seemed to be major immunogens. Antigenic related proteins either of identical or slightly deviating electrophoretic mobilities to the 40-kDa protein were observed with the other members of Bacteroidaceae tested. The characteristic 70-kDa protein doublet seemed to be restricted to F. nucleatum although single protein bands of near identical molecular weights belonging to the other species tested also reacted. The data also indicate that the 60-kDa and 55-kDa polypeptides might be present in other species of Fusobacterium.
TI  - [Gene cloning of an Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 antigen that reacts to peripheral blood sera in advanced destructive periodontitis patients].
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) has been implicated in the etiology of juvenile periodontitis and also of advanced destructive periodontitis (ADP). It has been reported that the levels of the IgG antibody against the A.a. in the peripheral blood sera of the ADP patients were often high as well as those against the Bacteroides gingivalis. To clone the genes of antigen reactive to the sera of the ADP patients, we constructed a phage library of the A.a. strain Y4 DNA in lambda L47, which was then screened by the immunochemical detection method using a serum from the ADP patient. Of about 1,000 phage clones six were positive with the serum and also the sera of the other patients, and were named 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses indicated that clones 8 and 9 were identical and that these clones, 3 to 8 were overlapping since they shared in common the 4 kbp and 5kbp Hinc II DNA fragments of the A.a. The cloned DNA fragment hybridized to the DNAs of the two other strains of the A.a. but did not to those of the Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides gigivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Fusobacterium nucleatum. These results suggest that the DNA sequence encoding an A.a. Y4 antigen strongly reactive to the sera of the ADP patients was present specifically in the A.a. but not in the other bacteria isolated from the periodontal patients. Thus, the DNA could serve also as a DNA probe for the diagnosis of periodontitis.
TI  - The microbiology of HIV-associated periodontal lesions.
AB  - 2 intraoral lesions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection  have recently been described: an atypical gingivitis and a rapidly progressive periodontitis. The microbiota associated with these gingival and periodontal lesions was investigated. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from 45 HIV-seropositive homosexual men and from 44 HIV-seronegative control subjects. Each sampled site was clinically and radiographically classified as HIV-associated gingivitis, HIV-associated periodontitis, healthy in an HIV-seropositive subject, or healthy, conventional gingivitis or classical periodontitis in a control subject. Plaque samples were examined by indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal antisera to detect Bacteroides gingivalis, B. intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Anaerobic culturing was used to detect black-pigmented Bacteroides species, Fusobacterium species, and A. actinomycetemcomitans to confirm the immunofluorescence findings. We detected B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans in significantly more HIV-periodontitis sites (80, 65, 59 and 61% of sites, respectively) and HIV-gingivitis sites (61, 70, 52 and 52%, respectively) than in HIV-seropositive healthy and control sites (p less than 0.05). The results indicate that the microbiota found in HIV-periodontitis is similar to that of classical periodontitis. In contrast, however, the microbiota associated with HIV-gingivitis is strikingly different from that of conventional gingivitis. The similarity in the prevalence of periodontopathic organisms in both HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis suggests that the HIV-gingivitis lesion may be a precursor to the tissue destruction observed in HIV-periodontitis. Hence, early detection and treatment of the HIV-gingivitis lesion may prevent the rapid and extensive breakdown of periodontal tissues associated with HIV-periodontitis.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. A quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 X 10(6) CFU/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.
TI  - Cytotoxicity against various cell lines of lipopolysaccharides purified from Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Veillonella isolated from infected root canals.
AB  - The cytotoxicity against two mesenchymal cell lines, L-929 and WI-38, and two epithelial cell lines, KB and HeLa S-3, of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) purified from strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella parvula isolated from infected root canals was investigated. The inhibition of cell growth by these LPS's was considerable for mesenchymal cell lines, but mild for epithelial cell lines. The cytotoxic effect of F. nucleatum LPS was the greatest and that of B. gingivalis LPS was the least.
TI  - Standardisation of quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early detection of bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early diagnosis of bacteraemias. Small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. Bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. Blood cultures inoculated with Clostridium perfringens and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. Blood cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group A) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. Blood cultures inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within 24 to 48 h of incubation. Since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.
TI  - Recognition of Fusobacterium nucleatum subgroups Fn-1, Fn-2 and Fn-3 by ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns.
AB  - DNA from representative strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum subgroups Fn-1, Fn-2 and Fn-3 was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and TaqI and the electrophoretically separated fragments hybridized with a 32P-16S rRNA gene probe from E. coli. The rRNA gene restriction patterns from DNA digested with either enzyme allowed the clustering of strains into the three subgroups. However, TaqI digested DNA yielded a wider distribution of taxonomically useful bands (ca 0.65 +/- 14.3 kbp) and the pattern produced was characteristic of each subgroup. The present method is a simple and reliable means of identifying the three subgroups of F. nucleatum and provides a useful method for further studies of the heterogeneity of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Lectinlike interactions of Fusobacterium nucleatum with human neutrophils.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum expresses lectinlike adherence factors which mediate binding to a variety of human tissue cells. Adherence is selectively inhibited by galactose, lactose, and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. In this study, adherence of F. nucleatum to human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) was investigated. The results indicated that the fusobacteria adhered to live and metabolically inactivated or fixed PMNs. Adherence of F. nucleatum resulted in activation of PMNs as determined by PMN aggregation, membrane depolarization, increased intracellular free Ca2+, superoxide anion production, and lysozyme release. Transmission electron micrographs showed that F. nucleatum was phagocytized by the PMNs. Microbicidal assays indicated that greater than 98% of F. nucleatum organisms were killed by PMNs within 60 min. Adherence to and activation of PMNs by F. nucleatum were inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine or lactose greater than galactose, whereas equal concentrations of glucose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, mannose, and fucose had little or no effect on F. nucleatum-PMN interactions. Pretreatment of the fusobacteria with heat (80 degrees C, 20 min) or proteases inhibited adherence to and activation of PMNs, but superoxide production was also stimulated by heated bacteria. The results indicate that interaction of F. nucleatum with PMNs is lectinlike and is probably mediated by fusobacterial proteins which bind to other human tissue cells. Adherence of F. nucleatum to PMNs in the absence of serum opsonins, such as antibodies and complement, may play an important role in PMN recognition and killing of F. nucleatum in the gingival sulcus and in the subsequent release of PMN factors associated with tissue destruction.
TI  - Characterization of coaggregation between Bacteroides gingivalis T22 and Fusobacterium nucleatum T18.
AB  - Bacterial adherence is a key factor in the colonization of the oral ecosystem, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which the pathogen Bacteroides gingivalis adheres in the periodontal environment. We examined the ability of strains of B. gingivalis to coaggregate with selected microorganisms isolated from the subgingival microbiota of the cynomolgus monkey. A strong interaction was demonstrated between strains of B. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas less pronounced or no interaction was observed with other oral isolates. Electron microscopic examination of coaggregates revealed large masses of bacteria, in which the fusiform F. nucleatum T18 and coccobacillary B. gingivalis T22 cells formed a woven pattern. To investigate this interaction and the nature of the bacterial cell surface molecules involved, we used a microcoaggregation assay. Galactose and galactose-related sugars blocked coaggregation, in contrast with the lack of effect of glucose or glucose-related sugars. The ability of F. nucleatum T18 cells to coaggregate was diminished by pretreatment with pronase. Pretreatment of B. gingivalis T22 cells with pronase resulted in an inhibition of coaggregation, whereas pretreatment with sodium metaperiodate completely abolished coaggregation. These data suggest that the coaggregation between B. gingivalis T22 and F. nucleatum T18 represents a carbohydrate-lectin interaction, mediated by a galactose-containing carbohydrate on B. gingivalis T22 and a protein on F. nucleatum T18.
TI  - Inhibition of coaggregation between Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis by lactose and related sugars.
AB  - The coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 and Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis PK1924 was inhibited equally well by lactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and D-galactose, which caused 50% inhibition of coaggregation at 2 mM sugar concentration. Other sugars such as D-galactosamine, D-fucose (6-deoxy-D-galactose), and alpha-methyl- and beta-methyl-D-galactosides also inhibited coaggregation. Sugar specificity was apparent, since neither L-fucose, L-rhamnose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, nor N-acetylneuraminic acid was an inhibitor. Protease treatment of the fusobacterium completely abolished coaggregation, whereas it had no effect on the coaggregating activity of the porphyromonad. Although numerous lactose-inhibitable coaggregating pairs are known to occur among gram-positive bacteria, this report and the accompanying survey (P. E. Kolenbrander, R. N. Andersen, and L. V. H. Moore, Infect. Immun. 57:3194-3203, 1989) are the first studies demonstrating the extensive nature of this type of interaction between gram-negative human oral bacteria. The significance of galactoside-inhibitable coaggregations between these two potential periodontal pathogens is discussed.
TI  - Coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas flueggei, Selenomonas infelix, Selenomonas noxia, and Selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 Selenomonas strains, including S. sputigena (24 strains), S. flueggei (10 strains), S. infelix (5 strains), and S. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Propionibacterium, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with Actinomyces naeslundii PK984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. In contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. Each fusobacterium strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. Coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by EDTA, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. Likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. Heating the fusobacteria at 85 degrees C for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. Heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. Although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective. The strains of F. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. Collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. The contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.
TI  - Comparison of four commercial brucella agar media for growth of anaerobic organisms.
AB  - Four different commercial brucella blood agar plating media (Anaerobe Systems, BBL Microbiology Systems, Remel, and Scott Laboratories) were compared for the abilities to recover anaerobic organisms from clinical specimens and to support the growth of American Type Culture Collection anaerobic stock cultures. Following 24 h of incubation in an anaerobe chamber, Anaerobe Systems prereduced, anaerobically sterilized brucella plates yielded 63% of the total clinical anaerobe isolates, the Scott medium yielded 51%, the Remel medium yielded 42%, and the BBL medium yielded 37%. Poor growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. nucleatum, and pigmented Bacteroides spp. was observed on brucella media obtained from BBL, Remel, and Scott. Data obtained with stock anaerobic cultures showed that Anaerobe Systems plates yielded good growth and produced a larger colony size with all of the strains tested in 1 day, whereas poor growth of Peptostreptococcus spp., B. melaninogenicus, and Fusobacterium spp. was noted on brucella media from BBL, Remel, and Scott.
TI  - [Chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. Murine peritoneal PMN was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. The PMN response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (CL) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the CL response were also measured. The bacteria which could induce a high level of CL response of PMN were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were Staphylococcus subsp. and Actinomyces subsp.; low levels were Lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of Streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Phagocytic indexes of PMN to various kind of bacteria were distributed from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 PMN were 27 to 301. There was no correlation between CL values and phagocytic indexes or between CL values and the bacterial number in 100 PMN by limiting the data on Staphylococcus, Streptococcus subsp. and Lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. There was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from PMN by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of PMN. Either catalase activities or SOD activities were measured by H2O2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. Neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of CL response.
TI  - "Reverse" DNA hybridization method for the rapid identification of subgingival microorganisms.
AB  - A "reverse" hybridization method is described, in which whole chromosomal DNA was extracted from 10-20 colonies of "unknown" strains in pure culture and labelled with digoxigenin by a random primer technique. DNA probes were prepared from a total of 23 strains and hybridized with targets containing 100 ng purified, denatured DNA from 38 reference strains fixed to nitrocellulose. 21/23 digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes successfully detected all members of the homologous species present on filters. Probes to Fusobacterium nucleatum strains 364 and MG detected 3/4 and 1/4 members of this species, respectively; 13/23 probes were 100% specific, but cross reactions between 10 probes and DNA targets from closely related, heterologous species occurred in 15/834 possible instances. False-positive reactions that occurred between closely related species were, however, easily distinguished and did not prevent the accurate identification of probe strains. Digoxigenin-labelled probes were capable of detecting 100 pg of homologous DNA. The reverse hybridization procedure allows identification or grouping of a large number of isolates within 3 days and provides a more economical means of characterizing subgingival isolates than predominant cultivable techniques and conventional phenotypic testing. This method could be adapted for the direct identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Influence of age and immunization on development of gingivitis in rats.
AB  - To study the effect of age and antigenic priming on the development of gingivitis, 33 healthy rats were placed in contact with Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides gingivalis. On days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after inoculation, the gingival condition was judged clinically and histologically, and serum antibody titers against the bacteria were measured. The rats were divided into three groups: 1 month old, 3 months old, and 3 months old immunized. None of the young rats developed gingivitis during the experiment, whereas half of the adult and all of the adult immunized rats bled on probing on days 7 and 14. In general, antibody titers against the bacteria were low in young rats, moderate in adult rats, and high in adult immunized rats. These results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.
TI  - The microbiota of early periodontitis lesions in adults.
AB  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of shallow progressive (active) periodontal lesions in 4 adults (29-40 years) was compared to that of shallow inactive sites. Periodontal attachment levels were monitored longitudinally, and sites showing 2-3 mm attachment loss in the previous 1-2 months were considered disease active. Inactive sites showed no change in attachment level. The microbiota of shallow sites was dominated by gram negative rod species including Wolinella recta, Bacteroides forsythus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. W. recta was isolated in higher incidence and proportions from the active compared to inactive sites, and showed a positive relationship to bleeding on probing. Cluster analysis of species isolated from sites grouped sites from each individual together. This preliminary investigation suggested that a similar range of pathogens may be related to early periodontitis in adults as that previously reported for advanced diseased sites, and that different subjects may demonstrate different periodontal infections.
TI  - [Studies on anaerobic infection in oro-maxillary region--rapid diagnosis by gas-liquid chromatography and antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Subject material for this study was pus collected from patients with purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. Direct gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from GLC analysis and anaerobic isolates in a PYG medium. In addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. Results 1. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. Of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. Of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were Bacteroides sp. and 51 were Peptostreptococcus sp. The 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. Group A, in which no VFA was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. Group B, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group C, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group D, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. Direct GLC analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting Group E. 3. Whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in Group A and 60% in Group B, significantly higher percentages were noted in Group C (95%), Group D (100%) and Group E (100%). The following species were isolated as major member in the groups; Group A--Streptococcus intermedius, Group B--Peptostreptococcus micros, Group C--Fusobacterium nucleatum, Group D--Bacteroides gingivalis, and Group E--Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. In all cases, the sum of VFA produced in the PYG medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into Group A' to E'. Ratios of agreement between VFA as revealed by direct GLC and VFA as revealed by PYG.GLC were as follows: Group A-A'; 47.1%, Group B-B' and C-C'; 45%, Group D-D'; 87.5%, and Group E-E'; 62.9%. 5. In Group B, no propionic acid was detected. The 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group B'. In Group C, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group C'. Varelic acid was not detected in Group D; and 7 out of the 8 cases in which iso-valeric acid, irrespective of concentration, was detected belonged to Group D'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - The effect of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents on three bacterial mixtures.
AB  - A test tube technique was developed to screen bacterial mixtures to detect interbacterial interactions that play a role in determining sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. We found 3 mixtures where these bacterial interactions change the sensitivity to antimicrobials or change the proportions of each bacterial species in the mixture. The mixtures were: Fusobacterium nucleatum 102.3 and Bacteroides endodontalis ATCC 35406; F. nucleatum 102.3 and B. endodontalis BN11 a-f; and Capnocytophaga ochracea 1956c and Eubacterium saburreum 162.4. The antimicrobials used were metronidazole for the first 2 mixtures and tetracycline for the last. F. nucleatum seems to protect B. endodontalis from the action of metronidazole. Conversely, the growth inhibition of C. ochracea by E. saburreum was lifted when tetracycline was present. We also found that the growth of C. ochracea can then permit the subsequent growth of E. saburreum. The test tube method permits the evaluation both of interbacterial interactions and the detection of any protective mechanism against antimicrobial agents in a bacterial mixture. We found that F. nucleatum 102.3 can decrease the metronidazole level in the culture medium, and by the use of 14C-metronidazole we demonstrated that acetamide is produced from metronidazole.

TI  - [Microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  - If disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. One hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. Clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. Subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius. The levels of serum IgG antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. Thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. The clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. Active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and A. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of B. gingivalis was the highest among six bacterial species tested. A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens and F. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. The proportion of B. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. B. gingivalis and B. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of A. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. Sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to B. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to A. viscosus than those of healthy persons. Antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. After periodontal therapy, antibody levels to B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to A. viscosus increased to a slight degree. B. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. The proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. The results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring B. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum IgG antibody titer against this organism may aid in the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.
TI  - Enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - Necrobacillosis is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. Their possible role was studied in experiments made with a virulent FN strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously) were given. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with FN suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. Undiluted culture of a strain of Escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of FN to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered E. coli. A heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of E. coli culture had little if any effect on FN. Citrobacter freundii and comparatively small numbers of Corynebacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of E. coli. An alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of FN, though less strikingly than E. coli. FN increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and B. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.
TI  - Humoral immune response to selected subgingival plaque microorganisms in insulin-dependent diabetic children.
AB  - Juvenile diabetics have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontitis following puberty. However, little data are available on changes in the microbial flora that occur at the onset of puberty. This study was performed to determine if antibacterial antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms might be helpful in revealing changes in plaque flora at the onset and conclusion of puberty. Sera was obtained from 35 subjects (ages 7 to 18 years) selected from a population of insulin-dependent diabetics. The subjects were given a thorough medical examination which included an assessment of sexual maturation and a dental examination which included the recording of onset and magnitude of bleeding according to the papillary bleeding score. Antibody titers to A. naeslundii (AN), B. intermedius (BI), B. gingivalis (BG), F. nucleatum (FN), A. actinomycetemcomitans (AA), C. ochracea (CO) and T. denticola (TD) were determined using the microELISA. Stratification of antibody titers by age groups (less than or equal to 12 years, 12 to 15 years, greater than 15 years) revealed that titers to AN increased significantly (P less than 0.025, ANOVA) and progressively (P less than 0.05, regression analysis) with increasing age. In contrast, the titers to FN were maximal in the under 12 year group and decreased with age (ANOVA, P less than 0.05; regression analysis, P less than 0.05). There were no significant variations in titers observed for the other microorganisms. Stratification by sexual maturity revealed a similar progressive decrease of the titer to FN (ANOVA, P less than 0.05; regression analysis, P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation of Fusobacterium nucleatum and electron microscopic observations of spirochetes from tropical skin ulcers in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Tropical ulcer is a disabling condition of the lower leg affecting mainly young adults and older children. Microscopic observations of lesion material have shown fusiform bacilli and spirochetes. We used anaerobic culture techniques to isolate and identify these fusiform bacilli. Electron microscopic (EM) studies were performed to characterize the spirochetes. Material collected on swabs was used to inoculate pre-reduced media and to prepare smears for gram staining; the swabs were placed in fixative for EM study. After incubation, colonies containing fusiform bacilli were subcultured. The anaerobic gram-negative fusiform isolates were identified as Fusobacterium nucleatum using biochemical reactions, hemagglutination testing, and reaction of antigen preparations of the isolates and ATCC strains in serological tests with rabbit antisera. EM observations of negatively stained spirochetes revealed an 8-16-8 periplasmic flagellar arrangement. F. nucleatum and spirochetes may participate in the pathogenesis of this polymicrobic infection.

TI  - A pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of fusobacteria.
AB  - Strains of fusobacteria (143) were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) with a Horizon Instruments PYMS 200X. Fusobacterium necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum, F. mortiferum, F. varium, F. gonidiaformans, F. naviforme, F. russii and Leptotrichia buccalis were discriminated. Strains of fusobacteria isolated from tropical ulcers, although similar to F. mortiferum in conventional tests, were discriminated from each of these species in Py-MS. Identification of 416 spectra to species level agreed with conventional bacteriological methods in 91.8% of cases, was equivocal in 3.4% and disagreed in 4.8%. Classification based on pyrolysis data resolved groups largely corresponding to the recognised species. However, F. nucleatum strains were divided between two distinct groups. The tropical ulcer strains were resolved as a distinct homogeneous group. Py-MS is a rapid, inexpensive and convenient procedure for characterisation of bacteria, with the capacity for a high throughput of samples, although the initial cost of the apparatus is high.
TI  - [Microbial flora of periodontitis and monitoring of the effect of initial preparation by immunofluorescence microscopy].
AB  - The effect of initial preparation in adult periodontitis was evaluated by changes in clinical parameters and immunofluorescence microscopic counts of periodontal disease associated bacteria. Subgingival plaque samples were taken with sterilized paper points from 10 sites of 5 periodontally healthy persons and 44 sites of 23 adult periodontitis patients. Twenty-one diseased sites were periodically examined after plaque control and scaling, root planing. The direct immunofluorescence technique was used to detect Bacteroides gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Wolinella recta were counted by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. The proportions of B. gingivalis, B. forsythus, F. nucleatum, E. corrodens, T. denticola and W. recta in periodontitis lesions were significantly higher than those in healthy sites. The proportions of B. gingivalis and T. denticola were significantly related to GI, PlI, BI and PD, those of B. forsythus and W. recta to GI, PlI and BI, E. corrodens to GI and PlI, and F. nucleatum to BI. Reduced proportions of T. denticola were found in samples taken after establishment of proper plaque control. Subgingival scaling and root planing resulted in the reduction of proportions of B. gingivalis, E. corrodens, T. denticola and B. forsythus in the samples. The samples from positive bleeding sites contained higher proportions of B. gingivalis, T. denticola, B. forsythus and W. recta than did resolved sites. The present study shows that the immunofluorescence technique which detects B. gingivalis, T. denticola and B. forsythus is useful in monitoring the efficacy of initial preparation.
TI  - Relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - Examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and specific bacterial species in subgingival plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. Here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta G), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and arylsulfatase (AS) in GCF from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites from 13 periodontitis patients. Sites were scored for probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing, and GCF was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for PD and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. Plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. Various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting Bacteroides (BPB), Fusobacterium sp., Capnocytophaga sp, Streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. Relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (CFU) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by Spearman correlation analysis. beta G levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, B. intermedius, B. gingivalis, and total lactose negative BPB's. Correlation between beta G and F. nucleatum sp. or Capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. In contrast, LDH activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of B. gingivalis and total lactose negative BPB's. AS levels were significantly correlated only with B. gingivalis. beta G and LDH showed a significant negative correlation with levels of coccoid forms. Thus, beta G, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.
TI  - [Effects of periodontopathic bacterial components on phagocytic activity of rat peritoneal macrophages. Examination using ELISA].
AB  - This study examined the phagocytic activity of rat peritoneal resident macrophages to determine the movement of macrophages in local inflammation in periodontal disease. We studied phagocytic activity by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and used the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase soluble complex (PAP; soluble immune complex) as a marker in. We also determined the basic conditions of this examination and studied the effects of bacterial components and the supernatants of sonicated periodontopathic bacterias. We obtained the number of applied macrophages, the concentration of PAP to use and the incubation time. The phagocytic activity of macrophages was enhanced significantly by the bacterial components lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and muramyldipeptide (MDP). Phagocytic activity was also enhanced by the addition of the supernatant of sonicated Bacteroides gingivalis at 40 micrograms/ml (concentration of protein) and significantly suppressed at 320 micrograms/ml. Moreover, activity was significantly enhanced by the supernatant of sonicated Capnocytophaga suputigena at 40 micrograms/ml and 160 micrograms/ml, and suppressed by the supernatant of Fusobacterium nucleatum at a low concentration of protein (5 micrograms/ml). These results suggested that LPS of gram-negative bacteria's endotoxicity and MDP on pivotal structure of peptidoglycans, which are bacterial cell surface components, exerted an effect on phagocytic activity. It was further indicated that the phagocytic activity of macrophages varied with the effects of each periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel and  stannous fluoride gel for subgingival bacteria tested in serum at short contact times.
AB  - In vitro inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in serum of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel, stannous fluoride gel, stannous fluoride, metronidazole and amoxicillin were determined against Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The minimal inhibitory concentration was assessed by the agar dilution technique. The killing curves and minimal bactericidal concentration of the antimicrobial agents in inactivated bovine serum were determined after 5, 10, 20 and 60 minutes contact time. The minimal inhibitory concentration varied amongst the tested bacteria. A concentration of 128 micrograms/ml chlorhexidine digluconate, 20 mg/ml amine fluoride gel, 1 mg/ml stannous fluoride, 128 micrograms/ml metronidazole and 4 micrograms/ml amoxicillin inhibited the growth of the tested species. The minimal bactericidal concentration in serum for B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena after 10 min contact time was 5 mg/ml for chlorhexidine digluconate and 100 mg/ml for amine fluoride gel. A concentration of 200 mg/ml stannous fluoride gel in serum was bactericidal for the tested species after 10 min contact time, with exception of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Oral flora of mongrel and beagle dogs with periodontal disease.
AB  - The plaque flora was studied in adult mongrel and beagle dogs with periodontal disease. Gingival plaque from maxillary premolars was removed and cultured on various growth media. The flora in all dogs was composed of mostly anaerobic gram negative rods. Bacteroides asaccharolyticus was found in the highest proportion of plaque samples from mongrel dogs, and decomposed hydrogen peroxide suggesting catalase activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum was found in higher proportion in the plaque of beagle dogs as compared to B. asaccharolyticus. With the increasing numbers of obligative anaerobic gram negative organisms such as B. asaccharolyticus, the proportions of Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus decreased in the dogs with periodontal disease. The salivary flora was different from the plaque flora of the dogs with periodontal disease. It was constant regardless with the disease. The salivary flora of beagle dogs with the healthy gingiva was different from that of mongrel dogs. Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Eubacterium and black-pigmented Bacteroides (BPB, mainly B. asaccharolyticus) were higher proportion in the flora of beagle dogs as compared to mongrel dogs, while Fusobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, yeast and molds were lower in the flora. The results reveal that B. asaccharolyticus and F. nucleatum are common pathogens and uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in dog.
TI  - Isolation of a corncob (coaggregation) receptor polypeptide from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Corncobs, which are distinct morphological units formed by the ordered coaggregation of a filamentous microorganism and streptococci, can be made in vitro by using oral strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguis. Previous studies have shown that strains of F. nucleatum contain one of at least two different types of corncob receptor. The objective of this study was to isolate the receptor from F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 as the first step in the elucidation of the molecular basis of corncob formation. The cell envelope fraction from this bacterium was treated with trypsin, delipidated with chloroform-methanol, and subjected to ion-exchange chromatography. A single polypeptide (apparent Mr, 39,500), which was eluted from the column with 0.5 M sodium chloride and extracted with dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide to remove contaminating lipopolysaccharide, inhibited corncob formation between strain ATCC 10953 and S. sanguis CC5A. Similarly derived cell fractions from either F. nucleatum FDC 364 or Fusobacterium necrophorum failed to effect coaggregation in the inhibition assay. Amino acid analysis of the polypeptide showed a moderately hydrophobic character (polarity index, 41) and 11% basic residues. Antiserum made against the purified polypeptide agglutinated F. nucleatum ATCC 10953, neutralized the ability of this bacterium to form corncobs, and agglutinated whole cells of S. sanguis CC5A that were precoated with the receptor polypeptide. The identification and isolation of this receptor should greatly enhance our ability to define some of the complex intergeneric coaggregation mechanisms that are thought to occur in the human oral cavity.
TI  - Chemiluminescence of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes from adult periodontitis patients.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN's) constitute a primary host resistance factor  against infection. This study investigated the chemiluminescent (CL) response of peripheral blood PMN's isolated from human subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 subjects were categorized on the basis of age and periodontal disease status into 4 equal groups--young healthy, young diseased, old healthy and old diseased. PMN CL was stimulated using heat-killed, serum-opsonized Fusobacterium nucleatum--a specific periodontopathic gram-negative anaerobe, and Escherichia coli as a gram-negative control organism. The results showed a statistically significant enhancement (p less than 0.05) in the CL response, which was cell associated, in the young diseased subjects. This was not seen in the old subjects (p greater than 0.05), suggesting that in periodontal disease in young subjects the peripheral blood PMNs may be in a metabolically activated state. There was nevertheless a degree of variability between individual subjects within each of the 4 clinical groups.
TI  - Structural analysis of lipopolysaccharides from Eikenella corrodens by use of murine monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - The structure of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of Eikenella corrodens was analyzed with prepared murine monoclonal antibodies. A common core epitope was found in three of seven LPS preparations from E. corrodens strains and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586. Four E. corrodens LPSs were found to possess an O-side-chain epitope which cross-reacted with LPSs from Fusobacterium necrophorum ATCC 25286 and Capnocytophaga ochracea M-12. Lipid A of E. corrodens LPS shared an epitope common among LPSs from various gram-negative rods.
TI  - Utilization of amino acids and peptides by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum strains ATCC 10953, Fevl, F1, F3, and F6 utilized amino acids, in particular glutamate, histidine, and aspartate were common to all strains. Strain differences were observed in the utilization of threonine, serine, lysine, tyrosine, and methionine, and only strain ATCC 10953 utilized all these amino acids. The glutamate and histidine pools were in all cases fully depleted before the other amino acids were attacked and at the same time all strains except 10953 started to utilize peptides at a noticeable rate. For strain Fevl, glutamyl- and aspartyl-containing peptides seemed to be of considerable nutritional importance, and this strain did not grow on a medium based on amino acids alone. On the other hand, strain 10953 did not utilize any peptides to a noticeable extent, and it could grow on an amino acid based medium.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
TI  - [Septicemia caused by beta-lactamase producing Fusobacterium nucleatum in a patient with neutropenia].
AB  
TI  - [Bacterial invasion in periodontitis, is it important in periodontal treatment?].
AB  - During the progression of periodontal disease bacteria invade the epithelial lining of the gingival pocket and the underlying connective tissue. This invasion was demonstrated in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), rapidly progressive periodontitis in adults (RPP) and in children with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome associated periodontitis. Using morphologic criteria or fluorescent antibody staining techniques spirochetes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, B. intermedius, Actinomyces species, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Mycoplasma have been identified in these tissue compartments. Recent light microscopic, electron microscopic and bacteriological studies demonstrated the presence of invading bacteria in the cementum and in the radicular dentin of teeth with periodontal disease. In 83% of 69 carries free periodontally diseased teeth bacteria were present in one of the dentin layer from the root. In 59% of these teeth the dental pulps contained bacteria. The composition of the flora resembled that of the subgingival flora. The use of chlorhexidine, fluoride, tetracyclines or metronidazole in the elimination of invading bacteria following mechanical periodontal therapy is discussed.
TI  - Modulation of human neutrophil adherence by periodontopathic bacteria: reversal by specific monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Previous investigations by us have shown that direct interaction of Fusobacterium nucleatum with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) results in the stimulation of PMN adherence whereas direct interaction with Bacteroides gingivalis results in PMN suppression. In the present study, panels of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against cell wall antigens of F. nucleatum and B. gingivalis were tested to determine their ability to block the modulatory effects of the bacteria in their interactions with PMNs. While no activity was demonstrated for any of the 9 MAbs raised against F. nucleatum, it was found that 2 of 16 MAbs raised against B. gingivalis were able to reverse the suppression of PMN adherence induced by the bacteria. Further studies on these 2 reactive MAbs showed that the effect of MAbs were abrogated by heat treatment as well as by trypsin proteolysis. Investigations into the nature of the reactive epitopes on the bacterial surface showed that they probably contain protein components susceptible to proteolytic attack by subtilisin. In addition, beta-galactose may be a component of the reactive epitopes for one of the MAbs, but sialic acid residues on the bacterial surface are probably not involved as their elimination by neuraminidase did not affect the binding of both MAbs. The results of the present study strongly validate our previous observations that direct specific interaction of B. gingivalis with human PMNs occurs, resulting in the suppression of PMNs.
TI  - Interleukin-1 and interleukin-1 inhibitor production by human adherent cells stimulated with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study examined the effect of the putative periodontopathic bacteria Bacteroides gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum on the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-1 inhibitors by human plastic-adherent mononuclear cells from normal donors. Fusobacterium mortiferum was used as a non-oral, non-pathogenic control organism. Unstimulated adherent cells spontaneously secreted an IL-1 inhibitor, whereas stimulation with B. gingivalis induced the synthesis and secretion of IL-1. With both fusobacteria IL-1 was present in the intracellular environment, whereas the predominant secretory product was either IL-1 or an IL-1 inhibitor. These results suggest that bacteria are capable of modulating cytokine production by monocytes and may thereby alter the local immune response.
TI  - [Inducing effect of periodontopathic bacteria on activation of macrophage functions and production of interleukin-1 by mouse peritoneal macrophages].
AB  - Periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by a bacterial infection and subsequently developed by immunopathological mechanisms thorough host-parasite interactions. The macrophage and lymphocyte are the major functional cell types in the lesion of the disease and participate in tissue destruction and alteration of the periodontal connective tissue as well as in host defense mechanisms. However, the detailed implications of macrophages in development of the disease is still unclear. The aim of this study was to gain more understanding of the functional role of macrophages in periodontal disease. In this study, we examined the inducing effects of sonicated extracts from some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, and Actinomyces viscosus, on activation of macrophage functions and IL-1 production by the macrophages from the mouse peritoneum. At a dose as low as 1 microgram/ml (dry weight) sonicated extracts from B. gingivalis induced an increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. A significant increase in the acid phosphatase and in glucose consumption was observed in the cultures at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after the addition of the sonicate. Sonicated extracts from A. viscosus, a gram-positive bacterium, as well as B. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and H. actinomycetemcomitans, gram-negative ones, were able to induce the increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of the macrophages. These periodontopathic bacteria were found to strongly induce IL-1 production by the macrophages as early as 24 h after addition of the sonicates. A significant increase in the IL-1 production was observed at a dose of 1 microgram/ml of the sonicates. The inducing ability was equivalent to 1 microgram/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The highest production of IL-1 was observed in the macrophages treated with H. actinomycetemcomitans among these sonicates. Sonicated extracts from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were able to induce the IL-1 production by macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice, which are LPS low-responders. These results suggest that periodontopathic bacteria have potent ability to induce macrophage activation and IL-1 production and that the activated macrophages may play an important role in development of periodontal disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Evidence for the existence of two classes of corncob (coaggregation) receptor in  Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance and TetM in oral anaerobic bacteria and Neisseria perflava-N. sicca.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant organisms isolated from six patients with periodontal disease included Bacteroides spp., Eubacterium spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria perflava-N. sicca, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Veillonella parvula, and facultative streptococci. All but the Bacteroides spp. and Eubacterium spp. hybridized with the TetM determinant. An additional 417 bacterial strains were screened, and 4% of both the oral streptococci and the Fusobacterium spp. hybridized with the TetM probe.
TI  - Relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. The sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. All clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. Certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. The combination of F. nucleatum, B. forsyth and W. recta (cluster VII) or B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and S. intermedius (cluster VIII) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. These clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. Clusters dominated by V. parvula (cluster III), the Actinomyces sp. (cluster X) or the combination of S. sanguis II, S. mitis, V. parvula and S. intermedius (cluster II) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more favorably to therapy. Sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Immunobiological properties of lipopolysaccharides isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953  and F. necrophorum ATCC 25286 by the hot phenol/water procedure. F. nucleatum LPS was composed of 16% (w/w) carbohydrate, 10% (w/w) hexosamine and 40% (w/w) fatty acid, while F. necrophorum LPS was composed of 26% (w/w) carbohydrate, 12% (w/w) hexosamine and 28% (w/w) fatty acid. These LPS preparations induced mitogenic responses in spleen cells of BALB/c, BALB/c (nu/nu) and C3H/HeN mice, and these responses were suppressed by the addition of polymyxin B. The preparations also induced the polyclonal responses of C3H/HeN spleen cells. In addition, enhanced glucose utilization and interleukin-1 production by murine peritoneal macrophages were demonstrated. Neither spleen cells nor macrophages from the 'LPS-nonresponsive' C3H/HeJ mouse were activated by LPSs from the Fusobacterium species.
TI  - Outer membrane protein pattern of Eubacterium plautii.
AB  - The outer membrane SDS-PAGE pattern of Eubacterium plautii was characterized by a large number of surface exposed low- and high-molecular-mass proteins. Silver stainable carbohydrate was not present. The pattern was clearly distinct from those of outer membrane preparations of Eubacterium saburreum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The results are compatible with a Gram-positive cell wall structure in E. plautii.
TI  - Microbial flora of surface versus core tonsillar cultures in recurrent tonsillitis in children.
AB  - Surface and 'core' tonsillar specimens were collected from 60 children, between 2 and 14 years of age, suffering from recurrent tonsillitis, in order to establish the reliability of surface tonsillar swabbing technique and to define the most frequently involved aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. From the qualitative point of view, the same mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained in both samples thus demonstrating the reliability of the surface swabbing technique. From the quantitative point of view, 187 microorganisms, 129 (69.2%) aerobes and 58 (30.8%) anaerobes were isolated from surface cultures while 184, 109 (59.2%) aerobes and 75 (40.8%) anaerobes from the core cultures, thus demonstrating a greater number of anaerobes in the core of the tonsil. The most common isolated aerobic microorganisms were the alpha- and beta-hemolytic Streptococci, the Neisseriae and the Staphylococcus aureus; the predominant anaerobic ones were the Fusobacterium nucleatum, the Bacteroides sp. and the Veillonella parvula. The isolated staphylococcus aureus and the bacteroides sp. were all beta-lactamase producers.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. Active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". The predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. Among the 33 subjects, W. recta, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, B. gingivalis and B. forsythus were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, S. mitis, C. ochracea, S. sanguis II, V. parvula and an unnamed Actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. The likelihood of a site being active was increased if B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, P. micros, A. actinomycetemcomitans, W. recta, or B. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if S. sanguis II, the Actinomyces sp., or C. ochracea were detected.
TI  - Identification of a galactose-binding lectin on Fusobacterium nucleatum FN-2.
AB  - A previous study has suggested that Fusobacterium nucleatum FN-2 contains a galactose-binding protein (lectin) on the cell surface (P. A. Murray, V. Matarese, C. I. Hoover, and J. R. Winkler, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 40:123-127, 1987). In the present study, the molecular specificity and size of this lectin were investigated by several techniques. Whole-cell affinity chromatography with asialofetuin covalently coupled to Sepharose 6MB demonstrated that 81% of 3H-labeled F. nucleatum were specifically eluted by 0.5 M galactose. Specific binding was calcium dependent and did not occur in the presence of calcium chelators. Binding was inhibited by preincubation with galactose. Agglutination of human parotid saliva by F. nucleatum was also inhibited by galactose and its structural analogs. Inhibition by lactose was 2 times that of galactose, inhibition by p-aminophenyl galactosides was 4 times that of galactose, and inhibition by asialoglycopeptides was 100 times that of galactose. Similar inhibition results were obtained for hemagglutination of neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. These findings suggest that the binding specificity of F. nucleatum FN-2 is more complex than simply the recognition of the monosaccharide galactose. This is consistent with the concept that lectins considered identical in terms of monosaccharide specificity can recognize fine differences in more complex structures. To identify the specific bacterial component(s) involved in galactose recognition, proteins of F. nucleatum FN-2 were separated on a 4 to 11% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate slab gel, transferred to nitrocellulose paper to renature bacterial binding sites, and then incubated with 125I-labeled asialofetuin. Autoradiographs of the nitrocellulose revealed a band at a range of Mr 300,000 to 330,000 which was not present when the blots were preincubated with galactose. These data support the concept that F. nucleatum FN-2 possesses a lectin that recognizes galactose and galactose-containing substrates.
TI  - Antibody synthesis specific for nonoral antigens in inflamed gingiva.
AB  - In vitro experimentation indicates that periodontitis-associated bacteria contain potent polyclonal B-cell activators (PBA). We reasoned that if PBA were operative in vivo, plasma cells specific for nonoral antigens should be present in the inflamed gingival tissues, which are characterized by a plasma cell infiltrate. To test this, rabbits with experimental periodontitis were immunized in the hind legs with the histochemically detectable antigen horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or glucose oxidase (GO). At various times after secondary immunization, inflamed gingival tissue was removed, sectioned, and treated histochemically to reveal plasma cells that specifically bound HRP or GO. Remarkably, by 9 days after secondary immunization, hundreds of HRP- or GO-binding plasma cells were found in the inflamed gingival tissue of immunized rabbits. The presence of these plasma cells, observed 7 to 10 days after booster immunization, was further substantiated by the presence of large amounts of locally produced HRP- or GO-specific antibody in gingival crevicular fluid. By 1 month after secondary immunization, the number of antigen-binding plasma cells had decreased dramatically, but a small number of antigen-specific plasma cells were detected for as long as 9 months after secondary immunization. The large number of HRP- or GO-specific plasma cells observed 9 days after immunization led us to see whether recently stimulated cells were more susceptible to PBA. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained at different times after booster immunization and cultured in the presence or absence of a PBA from Fusobacterium nucleatum. At 7 days after immunization, PBL spontaneously differentiated into antibody-forming cells in culture, and this process was enhanced by PBA. In contrast, PBL taken months after immunization produced little antibody in culture, and enhancement by PBA was difficult to detect. Compared with resting B cells, the recently stimulated B cells clearly differentiated more readily into antibody-forming cells. In conclusion, antibody synthesis specific for nonoral antigens did occur in inflamed gingival tissue, and a number of mechanisms, including PBA, probably contributed to this phenomenon.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of a porin fraction isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.
AB  - From Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 cell envelope fraction whose inner membranes had been removed by treatment with sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate, an outer membrane protein (37,000 Mr in a native state) was prepared by extraction with lithium dodecyl sulfate. The protein thus obtained showed distinct porin activity, namely, the ability to form hydrophilic diffusion pores by incorporation into the artificial liposome membrane. The porin fraction exhibited strong immunobiological activities in the in vitro assays: B-cell mitogenicity and polyclonal B-cell activation on murine splenocytes, stimulatory effects on guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, and enhancement of the migration of human blood monocytes. The porin fraction also exhibited immunoadjuvant activity to increase the antibody production against sheep erythrocytes in the spleen of mice that were immunized by sheep erythrocytes with porin. Although chemical analyses revealed that the test porin fraction contained a considerable amount of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (around 12% of the fraction), the studies with LPS-nonresponding C3H/HeJ mice and on the inhibitory effects of polymyxin B strongly suggest that most of the above bioactivities are due to porin protein itself, not to coexistent LPS in the porin fraction.
TI  - Refractory periodontitis: mixed infection with Bacteroides gingivalis and other unusual Bacteroides species. A case report.
AB  - Host immune response and the predominant subgingival microflora were evaluated in a 47-year-old male exhibiting severe, recurrent periodontitis. The patient's neutrophils were chemotactically elevated but other functions were within normal limits. Significantly, Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides zoogleoformans constituted 80% of the cultivable microflora and total cell count in subgingival plaque. The remainder of the cultivable microbiota was comprised of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Haemophillis aprophillis. The present study provides additional evidence for an association between B. gingivalis and severe, recurrent periodontal disease.
TI  - Characteristics of glutamate dehydrogenase, a new diagnostic marker for the genus Fusobacterium.
AB  - Enzymes representative of carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism were screened for  their presence and activity amongst species of the genus Fusobacterium. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) was reliably detected in all 25 strains studied. The pH profile of this enzyme and the DNA base composition of selected strains were also determined. DNA base composition of selected strains ranged between 28-32.9 mol% G + C. GDH was active between pH 7.5-11.5 but two pH profiles of activity, with optima at 9.5 and 10.5, were discernible among species. Apart from Fusobacterium nucleatum, which had a heterogeneous enzyme pattern, the GDH electrophoretic mobility was constant within a species but in a few cases the enzyme bands overlapped. A combination of the pH profile, the GDH electrophoretic pattern and the DNA base composition provided clear separation of the test organisms into discrete groups; however, a larger number of strains must be examined before the full potential of these tests can be evaluated.
TI  - An in vitro model to study bacterial invasion of periodontal tissues.
AB  - In periodontal disease, the abilities of bacteria to adhere to and degrade in vivo basement membranes should be considered as two of the rate-limiting steps for the potential active or passive invasion of gingival connective tissues. To study these mechanisms in greater detail, we used the PF HR-9 basement-membrane-like matrix to establish an in vitro model of bacterial invasion and degradation. Three gram-negative anaerobic periodontopathic organisms, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bound in considerably higher numbers to the HR-9 matrix than did 6 strains of gram-positive facultative organisms typically associated with periodontal health. In a further experiment with B. gingivalis, the organism rapidly degraded Type IV collagen, the major macromolecular component constituting the HR-9 matrix. Streptococcus mitis, the nonperiodontopathic bacterium tested, did not degrade this model matrix. This study provides evidence that B. gingivalis, a periodontopathic bacterium, is able to adhere to and degrade basement membranes, whereas nonperiodontopathic organisms appear not to share in these abilities.
TI  - The synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. Both Eubacterium lentum and Streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. The susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/L; only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefotaxime against members of the genus Bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/L. The MIC50 of cefotaxime to Bacteroides fragilis and B. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/L, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/L, respectively, when 4 mg/L desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. Full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the Bacteroides species tested. While cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus Bacteroides, the MIC of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.
TI  - [Sensitivity to an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination, of deep tonsillar flora isolated in chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Deep tonsillar flora were identified in tonsils removed from 48 patients, children and adults, with chronic tonsillitis and recurrent sore throats or obstructive hypertrophy. Most specimens (38/48) cultured multiple germs (2 to 5 different species) with aerobic and anaerobic Gram+ and Gram-forms, some being beta-lactamase producers. Of the total of 135 strains isolated, 104 were aerobic and 31 anaerobic. The species of aerobic germs most frequently isolated were: Apart from alpha-hemolytic streptococci of undertermined group (38 strains), Haemophilus sp. : 14 (including 3 beta-lactamase + strains), Staphylococcus aureus: 15 (including 11 beta-lactamase + strains), Streptococcus A : 10, Enterobacteriaceae : 6, Neisseria sp. : 8 (including 1 beta-lactamase + strain). And among the anaerobic germs: Peptococcus : 3, Veillonella alc : 10, Fusobacterium nucleatum : 9, Bacteroides melaninogenicus : 6, Other Bacteroides : 2. Of the 127 strains tested, 102 were sensitive to amoxicillin and 121 to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination. The presence of a beta-lactamase producing bacterium in 1 of 3 specimens suggests the risk of failure of treatment with penicillin, prescribed classically for this type of affection.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in the head and neck region.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria form the predominant flora of the oral cavity, outnumbering facultative organisms by 10-1,000: 1. The type of anaerobic bacteria and their concentration depend on the anatomical site and the degree of anaerobiosis in the different sites in the mouth. Three groups of anaerobic bacteria inhabit the oral cavity; the strict anaerobes, the moderate anaerobes, and the microaerophilic group of organisms. The majority of anaerobic bacterial infections occurring in the region of the mouth, head and neck are caused by the commensal flora. These infections include dental and periodontal disease where the predominant organisms are Bacteroides species, Veillonella, Bifidobacteria, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Propionibacterium species. More recently, Bacteroides endontalis has been isolated from a periapical abscess of endodontal origin and B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans and Wollinella species in chronic periodontal disease. Treponema species and other strict anaerobes are seen in smears of severe periodontal disease and acute necrotising gingivitis, but have not yet been isolated in pure culture. Until such time, their role in disease remains uncertain. Fusobacterium nucleatum is specially associated with severe orofacial infections which may extend into the mediastinum. Other anaerobic infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, and brain abscess. Treatment of these conditions should include the use of beta-lactamase resistant antimicrobials, such as clindamycin or one of the nitroimidazoles with penicillin.
TI  - Hemagglutinating activity of lipopolysaccharides from subgingival plaque bacteria.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations from the Bacteroides species B. endodontalis, B. intermedius, B. denticola, and B. melaninogenicus and from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens directly agglutinated erythrocytes of some kinds of animals. LPSs from the Bacteroides species B. gingivalis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. corporis, and B. loescheii and from Capnocytophaga ochracea did not possess any hemagglutinating activity. Pretreatment of LPSs with lipase and phospholipase C completely eliminated the hemagglutinating activity. The hemagglutinating activity was also affected by human serum, saliva, colistin, and polymyxin B but was not affected by sugars, amino acids, EDTA, or proteolytic enzymes. The role of this hemagglutinating activity in colonization by these microorganisms of the periodontal region is discussed.
TI  - A penicillinase-producing Fusobacterium nucleatum strain isolated from blood culture.
AB  
TI  - Attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular constituents of this matrix. Radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from PF HR-9 cells. Bacteroides gingivalis 33277, Fusobacterium nucleatum FN-2, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans GA3(A) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of A. actinomycetemcomitans GA3(NA) and SUNY AB67 (range, 20 to 25%). The attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). Competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of B. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. Similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of B. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. The adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. Strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated matrix proteins. The results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as B. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. On the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. The results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum-mediated immunomodulation of the in vitro secondary antibody response to tetanus toxoid and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  
TI  - Amino acid-dependent transport of sugars by Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.
AB  - Resting cells of Fusobacterium nucleatum 10953 (grown previously in a medium containing glucose) failed to accumulate glucose under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. However, the addition of glutamic acid, lysine, or histidine to anaerobic suspensions of cells caused the immediate and rapid accumulation of glucose. Except for the amino acid-dependent transport of galactose and fructose (the latter being transported at approximately one-third the rate of glucose), no other sugars tested were accumulated by the resting cells. Amino acid-dependent uptake of sugar(s) by F. nucleatum was abolished by exposure of cells to air, and under aerobic conditions the rates of fermentation of glutamic acid and lysine were less than 15% of the rates determined anaerobically. The energy necessary for active transport of the sugars (acetyl phosphate and ATP) is derived from the anaerobic fermentation of glutamic acid, lysine, or histidine. Competition studies revealed that glucose and galactose were mutual and exclusive inhibitors of transport, and it is suggested that the two sugars (Km = 14 microM) are translocated via a common carrier. The products of amino acid-dependent sugar transport were recovered from resting cells as ethanol-precipitable, high-molecular-weight polymers. Polymer formation by F. nucleatum, during growth in medium containing glucose or galactose, was confirmed by electron microscopy.
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Effect of periodontal therapy on specific antibody responses to suspected periodontopathogens.
AB  - The effects of clinically successful periodontal therapy were studied in juvenile periodontitis (JP) and rapidly progressive periodontitis (RP) patients and compared with periodontally healthy subjects (HS). Serum samples were obtained in 35 HS prior to the study and in 12 of these subjects 3-4 years later. Serum samples were obtained from 50 JP patients initially, 9 subjects immediately following surgical therapy and 29 of these subjects 3-4 years later. RP patients provided 46 initial serum samples, 9 following therapy and 27 samples 3-4 years later. Antibody levels were determined utilizing a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with Bacteroides gingivalis, B. ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serving as antigens. The JP patients showed an initial rise in antibody levels immediately following therapy followed by a significant decrease in antibody levels 3 to 4 years later. The RP patients did not show an early change in antibody levels but by 3 to 4 years post-therapy, antibody levels had significantly decreased. However, during this study, the antibody levels of JP and RP patients remained significantly higher when compared with HS patients.
TI  - A clinical, demographic and microbiologic study of ANUG patients in an urban dental school.
AB  - 35 ANUG patients were examined and compared clinically and demographically. Plaque removed from ulcerated sites in 20 patients was cultured using quantitative anaerobic procedures and examined by electron and darkfield microscopy. Patients were classified as having ANUG when presenting with ulceration and necrosis of interproximal papillae, pain and bleeding. The clinical symptoms of fetid odor, pseudomembrane formation, lymphadenopathy and elevated body temperature were present in 97%, 85%, 61% and 39% of the ANUG patients, respectively. 83% of the patients were smokers. The ANUG patients demonstrated a lower average age (24 years) than the general clinic population (32 years). There was a slightly higher % of male (54%) than female (46%) and the % of Caucasian (51%) and black (49%) ANUG patients were almost equal. Cultural studies revealed that gram-negative rods were the predominant cultivable micro-organisms present in the plaque, representing 78.2% of the total recoverable count. Of these, nearly half were strict anaerobes with Bacteroides gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum accounting for 7.8% and 3.4%, respectively. Anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (15.5%), gram-negative cocci (3.5%) and gram-positive rods (2.8%) were also isolated. Microscopic analysis of the morphologic composition of plaque revealed that rods (43%) constituted the greatest % of the total microorganisms observed followed by spirochetes (30%) and cocci (27%). 8 distinct types of spirochetal periplasmic flagellar arrangement were observed by electron microscopy, the "2-4-2" periplasmic flagellar arrangement being most numerous.
TI  - Bacterial adherence on replicas of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels.
AB  - A method for determining which molecules in a complex mixture of proteins can function as bacterial receptors was devised. Salivary proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Bacteria that were metabolically labeled with 3H or externally labeled with 125I were incubated on the nitrocellulose replicas. After 18 h at 4 degrees C, the unbound cells were removed by repeated washing of the replicas, and the bands to which the radiolabeled bacteria bound were visualized by autoradiography. By this technique, Fusobacterium nucleatum, which adheres via carbohydrate residues on receptor molecules, and Staphylococcus aureus, which recognizes the peptide portion of fibronectin, were shown to bind specifically to their respective receptors. These results suggest that this method can be useful for profiling bacterial binding to either the carbohydrate or the protein portions of molecules present in complex mixtures, such as those composing biological fluids or tissue substrates. Structural specificities, such as recognition sequences formed by certain oligosaccharides, could be further investigated by adding the appropriate simple sugars, as well as oligosaccharide inhibitors, to the incubation medium. The latter approach is particularly important since most glycoproteins carry multiple N- and O-linked carbohydrate substituents that could serve as bacterial receptors.
TI  - Suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  - Samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. When this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented Bacteroides (BPB) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Samples from the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. BPB were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). Expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total BPB population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were Bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). The most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was B. melaninogenicus. Expressed as percentages of children in whom BPB were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was B. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other BPB species were present in fewer than 5% of children. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.
TI  - [Adherence of Fusobacterium nucleatum to human cells].
AB  
TI  - Structural determinants of activity of chlorhexidine and alkyl bisbiguanides against the human oral flora.
AB  - We assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative and Gram-positive oral bacteria. Changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. Chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative as well as the Gram-positive oral bacteria. The alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented Gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. Alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a Gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. Hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane) and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against Fusobacterium nucleatum, also associated with periodontal disease. Seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against Actinomyces species. All test agents were active against Streptococcus mutans, a Gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. Hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. Analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Partial characterization of a peptidoglycan-protein complex from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1.
AB  - A protein in the cell wall of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 remained associated with the peptidoglycan during extraction with various detergents and organic solvents. On digestion of this peptidoglycan-protein complex (PPC) with murein hydrolases, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed polypeptide bands with apparent molecular weights (MWs) in the range of 3000 to 40,000. After reaction with maleic anhydride the electrophoretic mobilities of these polypeptide bands increased to those of MWs 3000 to 12,000. The PPC protein showed a limited susceptibility toward trypsin, giving polypeptides that migrated in SDS-PAGE as a diffuse band with MW in the range of 3000 to 6000. The amino acid composition of all polypeptide bands eluted from SDS-PAGE was very similar, whichever enzyme was used for the solubilization of the PPC, and was nearly identical to that found for the protein moiety of the PPC. On the basis of a MW of 3000 for a protein unit, about one molecule of protein was found per five peptidoglycan subunits. Lanthionine was not found associated with released polypeptide, and muramic acid and glucosamine were either absent or present in amounts less than one molecule per protein unit. The PPC was immunogenic in rabbits, and purified anti-PPC IgG reacted with murein hydrolase-released protein separated on SDS-PAGE but preferentially with bands of MWs greater than 18,000.
TI  - Chemical composition and immunobiological activities of sodium dodecyl sulphate extracts from the cell envelopes of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The chemical composition and immunobiological activities in vivo and in vitro of  sodium dodecyl sulphate extracts (SDS-SE) derived from periodontopathic bacteria (three strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, two strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, and one strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum) were investigated. The main components of SDS-SE were protein and lipid, with negligible amounts of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. Immunopotentiating activity was detected in both delayed-type hypersensitivity and antibody formation against the elicitation of a protein antigen with the SDS-SE preparations of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29524 and B. gingivalis 381 and 1021. On the other hand the SDS-SE of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522 enhanced only the induction of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response. All the SDS-SE preparations had mitogenic activity to splenocytes from BALB/c nu/nu, C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice. Migration-stimulating activity for human peripheral blood monocytes was detected especially in the SDS-SE preparations of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29524 and Y4. All of the SDS-SE samples inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts and caused degradation of the cells. The results suggest that the cell membrane components extractable with sodium dodecyl sulphate from periodontopathic bacteria are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
TI  - Certain bacterial species and morphotypes in localized juvenile periodontitis and in matched controls.
AB  - Subgingival microflora in localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) was examined by  culture of certain bacterial species and by direct dark-field microscopy in affected and unaffected periodontal pockets of 11 patients and in their age- and sex-matched controls. Only Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) correlated to periodontal destruction and occurred most frequently at the affected LJP sites. A.a., Bacteroides intermedius and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated in proportions greater than 5% of the flora at the affected LJP sites, but various Actinomyces spp. at the unaffected and control sites. The proportions of straight rods, fusiforms and small spirochetes correlated to gingival bleeding tendency and were higher at the affected LJP sites than at the control sites. Certain nonpigmented Bacteroides spp. and Eikenella corrodens were never isolated when only cocci were seen at dark-field microscopy. The more complex the flora, the more frequently B. intermedius occurred. The results support a significant role for A.a. in LJP and indicate that certain bacterial species appear to prefer occurring in the complex composition of subgingival microflora.
TI  - Multiple Fusobacterium nucleatum liver abscesses. Association with a persistent abnormality in humoral immune function.
AB  - A previously healthy 29-year-old man developed multiple hepatic abscesses secondary to Fusobacterium nucleatum. No underlying local disease was found. The leading portal of entry for the bacterium may have been the oral cavity; 4 days before the onset of his illness he had had extensive dental work. Immunological evaluation during the illness and in late convalescence (16 weeks after onset) revealed a persistent B cell abnormality characterized by markedly depressed in vitro secretion of immunoglobulins in response to pokeweed mitogen; however, serum immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses were normal. Abnormal numbers of suppressor T cells (OKT8+) and increased suppressor function were also present. Anaerobic pyogenic liver abscesses may occur in the absence of obvious underlying disease, but this case suggests that there may be an association with in vitro abnormalities of the immune system.
TI  - Production of monoclonal antibodies that recognize specific and cross-reactive antigens of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the cell surface antigens of Fusobacterium nucleatum 263 were obtained by fusion of murine myeloma cells (P3-NSI/1-Ag4-1) with the splenocytes of BALB/c mice immunized with whole cells of F. nucleatum 263. Screening was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the immunizing strain, F. nucleatum 263. Further selection was done using a bacterial panel consisting of Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Escherichia species. Twelve MAbs were selected on the basis of this screening procedure, seven of which reacted specifically with F. nucleatum 263. Two reacted with F. nucleatum 263 and ATCC 25586, and three reacted with F. nucleatum 263, ATCC 25586, and UQD-003 (a clinical isolate) and also cross-reacted with Fusobacterium russii ATCC 25533. The selected MAbs were then further characterized by absorption experiments with suspensions of intact whole bacterial cells, and the residual binding activity of the supernatants was determined in an ELISA. To determine whether the MAbs reacted with the same or different epitopes, pairs of MAbs were reacted together and independently in a checkerboard manner in an ELISA. The additive or nonadditive nature of the reactivity was determined. A competitive inhibition assay was performed using one labeled and selected unlabeled MAbs. The results of these experiments suggested some epitope sharing among the selected MAbs that reacted with a specific antigen on F. nucleatum and also shared cross-reactive antigens with the three strains of F. nucleatum and F. russii.
TI  - Factors affecting antimicrobial susceptibility of Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Fifteen clinical isolates of Fusobacterium species were studied to determine their quality of growth on five agar media, their susceptibility to penicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime, the inoculum effect, and the presence of L forms and beta-lactamase. Wilkins-Chalgren agar supported confluent growth best, but Fusobacterium nucleatum exhibited poor growth on all agar media. Most isolates exhibited poor reproducibility of MIC results with repeated agar dilution testing. However, most isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics at the breakpoint concentrations. No inoculum effect was observed, but preparation of an inoculum at a 0.5 McFarland nephelometric standard produced a lower than expected number of CFU (10(6) CFU) in some isolates. L forms were frequently seen. No beta-lactamase was found. The variability in MICs seen with beta-lactam antibiotics was not found when clindamycin was tested. MIC studies with Fusobacterium spp. may be complicated by poor growth on agar media, poor reproducibility, and small inoculum size.
TI  - The growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  - The present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. To this end, S. sanguis I strain Ny476 and S. sanguis II (S. mitior) strain Ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. Under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. S. sanguis II generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did S. sanguis I, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by S. sanguis II. In accordance, S. sanguis II had a higher cell yield and consumed a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did S. sanguis I. Interestingly, S. sanguis I, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas S. sanguis II has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. We propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. The special ability of S. sanguis II to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. The microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of Peptostreptococcus micros, S. sanguis II, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. Further, S. mitis and Gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. The enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. This resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.
TI  - Lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
AB  - Similar to Streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. For Lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at pHs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. Furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. Noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate. For F. nucleatum suspended at pH 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/L bicarbonate activation. When lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, pH 5.3, lysis was observed only with L. plantarum and S. mutans, but not with L. casei. The latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. In experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for L. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to salivary factors other than lysozyme. F. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral pH, suggesting that both Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.
TI  - Enrichment of subgingival microflora on human serum leading to accumulation of Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococci and Fusobacteria.
AB  - This study was undertaken to identify ecological factors that favour opportunistic pathogenic species in the subgingival microflora. In a first approach, human serum as a substitute for gingival exudate, was used for batch-wise enrichment of subgingival plaque. The microflora resulting after 5-6 enrichment steps consisted of black-pigmented and non-black-pigmented Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus micros and Fusobacterium nucleatum as the main organisms. It is noted that the same group of species was found to be enriched independent upon the origin of the subgingival plaque sample. It was suggested that these organisms are favoured by the increased flow of gingival exudate during inflammation. The consortium of organisms was capable of selective degradation of serum (glyco-)proteins. Four different types of degradation occurred. After a prolonged period of growth complete degradation of immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, transferrin and complement C3c was observed. Partial degradation of immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, transferrin, albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin and complement C3c and C4 was generally observed after 48 h of growth. Besides, immunoglobulin protease activity yielding Fc and Fab fragments was found. The consortium was also capable of consuming carbohydrate side-chains as indicated by an altered electrophoretic mobility of the serum glycoproteins.
TI  - Direct modulation of human neutrophil adherence by coaggregating periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Direct interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum and PMNs produced consistent enhancement of PMN adherence. In contrast, consistent suppression of PMN adherence was observed after direct interactions between PMNs and Bacteroides gingivalis or Actinomyces viscosus. The modulatory effects of these periodontopathic bacteria on PMN function could be seen as early as 2 min after interaction. The effects were abrogated by alterations of bacterial structural integrity with heat, formalin or ultrasonic disruption. Carbohydrate or glycoprotein receptors on PMNs may be involved because the effects were blocked by monosaccharides in the medium. Coaggregation experiments showed that permutations involving F. nucleatum always resulted in enhancement of PMN adherence, and that this can be blocked by D-galactose. These findings may have implications in the initiation and sustenance of chronic inflammatory tissue damage in periodontitis.
TI  - Bacteria-phagocyte interactions: Fusobacterium-induced secretion of a neutrophil  self-regulatory factor.
AB  - Direct interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum and human neutrophils resulted in the secretion of a neutrophil self-regulatory factor(s). The secretion of this factor was bacteria specific, and depended on the integrity of the bacteria cell surface. Factor secretion occurred within 15 min of bacteria--neutrophil interaction. Pre-treatment of neutrophils with cytochalasin B but not sodium fluoride inhibited factor secretion. The factor was sensitive to trypsin and heat treatment. Ultrafiltration experiments showed that it has a molecular weight between 10,000 and 30,000 daltons. Its biologic role may be that of a molecular mediator for the recruitment of resting neutrophils so as to amplify the immunological and inflammatory response.
TI  - Possible existence of a novel amphipathic immunostimulator in the phenol-water extracts of Mycobacteriaceae.
AB  - The extracts having diverse immunostimulating activities were obtained as a water-phase fraction from four bacterial species representing the 4 genera (Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Gordona, and Rhodococcus) of Mycobacteriaceae by the phenol-water method, which is commonly used for extraction of endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria and amphipathic substances from gram-positives. These fractions, especially those of G. aurantiaca and R. terrae, showed strong stimulatory effects on murine splenocytes, macrophages of mice and guinea pigs, the immunoadjuvant activities in guinea pigs and mice, and the distinct activities inducing a tumor necrosis factor and interferons alpha/beta and gamma in primed mice. The fractions from G. aurantiaca and R. terrae exhibited potent pyrogenicity and the ability to activate the clotting enzyme cascade of the horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus). Some of these biological activities were not very different from the potency of the reference endotoxic LPS derived from Escherichia coli or Fusobacterium nucleatum. But the test fractions neither showed the activity to prepare rabbit skin to the local Shwartzman reaction, nor reacted with anti-lipid A conventional and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, unlike LPS, these fractions stimulated the splenocytes of C3H/HeJ mice (LPS-Nonresponder). Although the fractions showing the above biological activities have not yet been adequately purified, they contained polysaccharides, whose main constituent sugar is mannose with a smaller amount of arabinose, fatty acids consisting primarily of palmitic, stearic, and tuberculostearic acids, and small amounts of peptides and amino sugars. Since components characteristic of known immunomodulators of bacterial origin, namely endotoxins (lipid A's), cell wall peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acids, cord factors (trehalose dimycolates), or deoxyribonucleic acids, were practically not detected in these fractions, the agent responsible for the above bioactivities is considered to be a novel substance different from the known, bacterial immunomodulators.
TI  - Differential expression of Class II (DR & DQ) antigens by human gingival Langerhans' cells and keratinocytes in vitro.
AB  - The expression of the Class II products DR and DQ on human gingival epithelium was examined using immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining. Differential expression of Class II antigens was seen in chronic gingivitis in adults, with T6(+) DR(+) cells being more numerous than T6(+) DQ(+) cells. The periodontopathic organism Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) induced DQ expression on Langerhans' cells (LC) during in vitro explant culture of gingival tissue. This effect was mimicked by endotoxin (LPS) from F. nucleatum and by E. coli LPS. These results indicate that differential expression of Class II products, a feature of chronic gingival inflammation, may result from the action of LPS on gingival LC.
TI  - Mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, and blocking of the penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is the production of beta-lactamase. beta-Lactamases in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium species have been described. beta-Lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is most commonly mediated by the production of beta-lactamase, primarily of the cephalosporinase type. Studies have also shown that B. fragilis can produce a penicillinase that inactivates piperacillin and carbenicillin. Enzymes that inactivate cefoxitin and imipenem have also been found in B. fragilis. The nonfragilis Bacteroides species produce beta-lactamases mainly of the penicillinase type. Recently a penicillinase from Fusobacterium nucleatum has been characterized. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.
TI  - Clinical, pathogenetic, and laboratory features of Capnocytophaga infections.
AB  - Granulocytopenia and oral mucosal defects have been reported to be important predisposing factors to recently recognized cases of Capnocytophaga septicemia. The authors call attention to an apparent preponderance of these cases in the pediatric age group and emphasize laboratory features which they have found helpful in the diagnosis of Capnocytophaga infections. Thirteen patients with Capnocytophaga infections were seen during a seven-year period. Seven of these patients had Capnocytophaga bacteremia. Six of seven bacteremic patients were granulocytopenic, six had oral mucosal defects, and three died. Five of the seven bacteremic patients were younger than 20 years of age. This represents a disproportionate distribution of cases in the pediatric age group within the author's institution, because 43% of blood culture specimens submitted to their microbiology laboratory are obtained from pediatric patients. This observation is supported by a review of the reported cases of Capnocytophaga septicemia in which 7 of 12 patients were younger than 20 years of age. Because Capnocytophaga may superficially resemble the more commonly isolated Fusobacterium nucleatum, distinguishing features for laboratory identification are discussed.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  - The emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. A significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Bacteroides species and Fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. One beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three Staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase-production in Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae or Branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli strain. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. The increase of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group A streptococci when previous treatment has failed.
TI  - Humoral antibody response against Bacteroides gingivalis-specific antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody in adult periodontal patients.
AB  - An antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody specific for Bacteroides gingivalis  was purified in the presence of 0.5% (wt/vol) beta-octyl-glucoside by immunoadsorbent column chromatography. The purified antigen was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining, and the pattern of SDS-PAGE agreed with that of immunoblotting. The molecule exhibited an apparent molecular weight of about 62,000 by SDS-PAGE. The antigen was sensitive to trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, DNase I and II, and heating, but insensitive to RNase and neuraminidase. By the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, the purified antigen was not cross-reactive with rat polyclonal antibodies to each of several black-pigmented Bacteroides species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. These results indicate that the purified antigen is specific for B. gingivalis. Humoral antibody titers in adult periodontal patients against the specific antigen were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum immunoglobulin G antibody titers against the specific antigen in adult periodontal patients correlated significantly with the severity of periodontal disease. However, such significant correlation was not observed with serum immunoglobulin M antibody titers.
TI  - Mucosal induction of systemic T cell tolerance by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine if mucosal presentation of the periodontopathic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum could induce systemic tolerance. Two separate protocols of mucosal priming were carried out. In the first, mice were gastrically intubated on 2 consecutive days; this was repeated 5 days later. In the second protocol, mice were similarly primed but received another priming dose after a further 7 days. Positive control mice were similarly primed with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) while negative control animals were sham-primed with saline. Following mucosal priming, mice were systemically sensitized with the respective antigen and then subsequently challenged in the left hind footpad. The right footpad was challenged with saline and served as a negative control. Serum antibody levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination assays. Mucosal priming with F. nucleatum was found to suppress the local delayed type hypersensitivity reaction as determined by footpad measurements. Sham-priming did not suppress the local response. On the other hand, the levels of serum antibodies were not influenced by mucosal priming. These results suggest that under the experimental conditions used, mucosal presentation of F. nucleatum can induce a degree of split tolerance in which T cell responses are suppressed while B cell responses remain intact. The implication of this finding to human periodontal disease is yet to be determined.
TI  - Frequency distributions of periodontal attachment loss. Clinical and microbiological features.
AB  - The present investigation attempted to determine if the pattern of past periodontal destruction could be concisely summarized, and related to other clinical and microbiological parameters. 61 subjects between the ages of 12 and 61 years with destructive periodontal disease were evaluated at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. The frequency distribution of baseline attachment level measurements was computed for each individual. A curve fitting algorithm was used to fit the frequency distribution to 1-, 2-, and 3-term normal distributions. The parameters of the fit could be used to summarize concisely all of the frequency distributions. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished. Pattern I required a two-term distribution with localized destruction at less than 34% of sites and was further divided into 3 groups, depending on average attachment loss at diseased sites. The means of the second peak for the subgroups were 2.7, 5.3, and 8.6 mm, respectively. Pattern II exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with multiple peaks in the frequency distribution requiring a 3-term distribution for satisfactory fit. However, a significant proportion of sites was not affected. Pattern III exhibited a single-peaked normal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. Mean attachment levels of the peaks in this group ranged from 2.7 to 8.4 mm. 23 of the 61 subjects showed significant attachment loss at 1 or more sites during the course of bi-monthly monitoring, as determined by the tolerance method of analysis. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these active sites and matched with control sites prior to therapy. The proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius, and Eikenella corrodens were significantly elevated in active and control sites of subjects in groups II and III combined (the widespread disease groups), and proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Propionibacterium acnes were elevated in active and control sites of the more localized disease group I subjects. Group I subjects showed a 13- to 15-fold decrease in hazard rates of periodontal sites after Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline, whereas groups II and III subjects showed 2-to 6-fold decreases.
TI  - Sensitization with Fusobacterium nucleatum targets antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to mammalian cells.
AB  - Incubation of mammalian tumor cells with either soluble of insoluble fractions (10 to 100 micrograms/ml) of Fusobacterium nucleatum sensitizes them to the destructive activity of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector cells in the presence of anti-F. nucleatum antisera. All three types of ADCC effector cells are capable of destroying F. nucleatum-sensitized target cells with varying degrees of effectiveness (lymphocytes much greater than monocytes greater than neutrophils). Hyperimmune rabbit anti-F. nucleatum antisera were active at a dilution as high as 1/100,000. Our studies indicated that F. nucleatum must be bound to the target cells since if either the effector cells are treated with F. nucleatum or F. nucleatum is directly to an ADCC reaction, there is no significant effect on cytotoxicity. The kinetics of F. nucleatum-targeted ADCC are identical to those of classical ADCC, suggesting a similar mechanism. The specificity of F. nucleatum-targeted ADCC was demonstrated by cold target inhibition studies and by showing that other antibacterial antisera were incapable of mediating the activity.
TI  - [Sensitivity of anaerobes to 8 antibiotics].
AB  - We studied the susceptibility of 282 obligate anaerobes to 8 antibiotics. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens taken during 1983 and 1984. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a microplate method for 245 strains and agar dilution for 33 Bacteroides asaccharolyticus strains. Tested strains were as follows: 85 Bacteroides fragilis, 71 Clostridium, 19 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 35 Peptostreptococcus, 39 Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides bivius and 33 Bacteroides asaccharolyticus. Tested antibiotics were: metronidazole, clindamycin, minocycline, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, keflin and carbenicillin. For Bacteroides fragilis, the three most active antibiotics were metronidazole (inhibition of all strains with 8 micrograms/ml), minocycline and clindamycin (inhibition of 95% of strains by MICs less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). However, four strains were resistant to clindamycin (MICs greater than 8 micrograms/ml). The other anaerobic strains tested were susceptible. However, a few Bacteroides bivius strains were resistant to keflin (MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml for 5% of strains).
TI  - Desulfuration of cysteine and methionine by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium frequently isolated from human dental plaque. It is capable of the desulfuration of cysteine and methionine, resulting in the formation of sulfide and thiol volatiles, respectively. Intact cells, as well as cell-free extracts produced by French pressure cell lysis of F. nucleatum, hydrolyzed radiolabeled cysteine to produce sulfide, pyruvic acid, and ammonia. The hydrolysis products of radiolabeled methionine were a volatile thiol, ketobutyrate, and ammonia. Both activities were associated with the cytoplasmic component, not the membrane. The desulfuration mechanisms are heat-labile, inhibited by the presence of excess substrate, and rates are dependent upon substrate concentration. These dissimilar pathways by F. nucleatum can account in part for the presence of sulfur-containing volatile products that occur in the mouth.
TI  - [Immunobiological activity of 41K protein (porin) derived from the cell envelope  of Fusobacterium nucleatum].
AB  
TI  - [Activity of cefotetan against anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - We determined the susceptibility to antibiotics of 64 strains of obligate anaerobes. Tested bacterial strains were as follows: 28 Bacteroides fragilis, 22 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 10 Clostridium perfringens, and 4 Bacteroides bivius. Tested antibiotics were cefotetan, cefoxitin and piperacillin. Cefotaxime was tested against 20 Bacteroides fragilis strains. Bacteroides fragilis, which is the most resistant species, was susceptible to cefotetan, cefoxitin and piperacillin, with comparable MICs for these three drugs (0.5 to 16 micrograms/ml); cefotaxime was less effective (MICs = 0.5 to 128 micrograms/ml). Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium perfringens were highly susceptible to cefotetan, cefoxitin and piperacillin.
TI  - Attachment level changes in destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - The present communication attempts to summarize some of the features of attachment loss which are of interest to the clinician and the statistician analyzing data from clinical trials. These include the measurements employed to detect changes in attachment level, the nature of the destructive disease process and the effects of therapy on the attachment level measurements. Although there are several difficulties associated with the attachment level measurement, at the present time it appears to be the best estimator of periodontal attachment available. The overall standard deviation of this measurement in greater than 46,000 replicate measurements at periodontal sites in 58 subjects was 0.78 mm (range 0.4 to 1.2 mm). In the periodontally healthy subject, the length of the attachment measured around 28 teeth is approximately 700 mm. Therefore, there are approximately 1400 adjacent points along the periodontal attachment where a measurement could be made using a periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip. If 6 measurements were recorded per tooth, then approximately 12% of the possible probable points would be evaluated. Recent data indicate that destructive periodontal diseases progress with acute bursts of activity rather than as slowly progressive, continual processes. Such findings suggest new models of attachment loss progression. In one likely model, destructive periodontal diseases would progress by asynchronous bursts of activity at individual sites which occur with greater frequency during a finite period of time in an individual's life. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished when frequency distributions of attachment level measurements were constructed for 61 destructive periodontal disease subjects. Pattern I (30 subjects) exhibited a bimodal distribution with localized destruction occurring at less than 34% of sites. Pattern II (14 subjects) exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with a trimodal frequency distribution. Pattern III (17 subjects) exhibited a unimodal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. The proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius and Eikenella corrodens in subgingival plaque samples were significantly elevated in sites of subjects with patterns II and III (the widespread disease groups). Bacteroides intermedius, Streptococcus uberis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in sampled sites of localized disease subjects (pattern I). The effects of therapy by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline were examined by several statistical analyses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Outer membrane proteins of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1.
AB  - Outer membrane enriched material from six strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum was  analysed by SDS-PAGE. The protein profiles of all the strains were dominated by proteins with molecular masses of about 40 kDa, and a very high degree of homology in relation to apparent molecular masses was observed. In all strains except Fev1, one of the most dominant proteins exhibited heat modifiable properties, having an apparent molecular mass of about 38 kDa and 42 kDa when heated in SDS at 50 and 100 degrees C, respectively. None of the proteins of the outer membrane of F. nucleatum Fev1 demonstrated such heat modifiable properties. The 40 kDa protein, and several other proteins, appear to be both exposed on the cell surface and peptidoglycan associated.
TI  - Chemiluminescence in the assessment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte function in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN's) constitute the primary host resistance factor against infection. They are prominent cells in both the gingival tissue and gingival sulcus in most forms of periodontal disease. Although defective PMN function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) and rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP), this may not necessarily be the case in adult periodontitis (AP). A number of studies have failed to detect PMN dysfunction in AP. However, it may be that in this form of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD) the defects in peripheral blood PMN function are subtle and the methods used may lack the necessary sensitivity. Chemiluminescence (CL) is the light energy produced by the PMN during its interaction with bacteria or other particles and has been demonstrated to correlate well with antibacterial integrity. Measurement of CL produced by phagocytically challenged PMN's may provide a very sensitive assay of the functional ability of these cells, and, hence, may be useful in assessing PMN activity in CIPD. Recent studies using PMN's obtained from periodontal diseased patients challenged with the periodontopathic organism Fusobacterium nucleatum have revealed an elevated CL response compared to non-diseased controls. These results are reviewed and areas for future research discussed.
TI  - Oligosaccharides obtained by partial hydrolysis of lipopolysaccharide from Fusobacterium nucleatum F1.
AB  
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - DNA probes for identification of clinically important Bacteroides species.
AB  - Conventional procedures for identifying gram-negative anaerobes such as Bacteroides spp. are cumbersome and time-consuming. A simpler approach would be to use DNA probes to identify these organisms. Since many different species of gram-negative anaerobes are isolated from clinical specimens, the most useful DNA probes would be probes that identify a few clinically significant groups of anaerobes. To obtain such probes, we cloned HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA from various Bacteroides species and then screened these probes, labeled with 32P by nick translation, for hybridization to DNA from various species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and other gram-negative bacteria. We identified three DNA probes (pBFII-4, pBFII-5, and pBFII-6) that hybridized specifically to DNA from Bacteroides fragilis, the species that accounts for about half of all isolates from clinical specimens containing anaerobes. We identified one DNA probe (pBE-3) that hybridized to all members of the B. fragilis group, a group of species that resemble B. fragilis with respect to fermentation pattern and antibiotic resistances. We also identified one probe (pBO-21) that hybridized to DNA from all Bacteroides sp. strains as well as to DNA from strains of Fusobacterium necrophorum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. pBO-21, but not pBE-3, cross-hybridized with a cloned Bacteroides sp. 16S rRNA gene. The limit of detection for these probes was 10(6) bacteria. The probes could detect B. fragilis in blood culture medium and in mixed cultures with other gram-negative bacteria. Attempts to use biotin-labeled DNA probes instead of 32P-labeled probes were not successful because the Bacteroides sp. extracts contained material that bound the streptoavidin-peroxidase detection reagent.
TI  - Specificity of monoclonal antibodies reactive with Fusobacterium nucleatum: effect of formalin fixation.
AB  - Monoclonal antibody specific for Fusobacterium nucleatum was reacted with untreated and formalin fixed F. nucleatum cells by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of bacterial cells with formalin destroyed the antigenic determinant responsible for reactivity with this monoclonal antibody in both assays. Formalin fixation had no effect on hemagglutination activity (HA) of F. nucleatum cells or reactivity with polyvalent rabbit antiserum in double diffusion in agar. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that formalin fixation did not affect binding of F. nucleatum cells to microtiter plates. When developing monoclonal antibodies to be used as diagnostic reagents, the antigenic form utilized for immunization should be identical to the antigenic form which will eventually be used in the diagnostic assay.
TI  - Modulation of HLA-DR antigens in the gingival epithelium in vitro by heat-killed  Fusobacterium nucleatum and E. coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The in vitro influence of the periodontopathic organism Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) on gingival tissue was examined using an organ culture system. Treatment of gingival explants obtained from periodontally diseased sites with suspensions of FN, stimulated the expression of HLA-DR antigens by Langerhans cells (LC) in a dose-dependent fashion, and produced a maintenance of the LC markers T6 and ATPase. Similar effects were seen when E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was substituted for suspensions of FN. With both FN and LPS the expression of HLA-DR by gingival keratinocytes was maintained throughout the 72-h culture period, despite the cytotoxic effects of these agents. Using a variety of immunohistological techniques and a monoclonal antibody specific for the strain of FN used, it was possible to demonstrate the uptake of FN antigens by LC within the gingival epithelium.
TI  - Evaluation of amniotic fluid in preterm labor with intact membranes.
AB  - Amniotic fluid was obtained from 35 pregnant women in preterm labor with intact membranes. Their gestational ages ranged from 24 to 34 weeks. Bacteria were detected in only 1 (3%) of the 35 amniotic fluid samples. The anaerobic culture grew Bacteroides corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The L/S ratio was greater than 4.0 in six patients (17%), 2.5-4.0 in two (6%) and less than 2.5 in 23 (66%); the quantity of fluid was inadequate for L/S analysis in four (11%). None of the 35 newborns developed evidence of infection in the neonatal period. Only two women (6%) were febrile postpartum, and none experienced a prolonged hospital stay. Seven (20%) of the infants developed respiratory distress syndrome. Five (14%) developed hyaline membrane disease, and two (6%) had transient tachypnea of the newborn. Intrauterine infection may play a lesser role in preterm labor with intact membranes than previously postulated. Amniocentesis may provide useful information for directing management by permitting one to assess fetal pulmonary maturity and the presence of meconium.
TI  - Assessment of serum antibody patterns and analysis of subgingival microflora of members of a family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - In a study of members of a large family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis, we sampled the subgingival microflora and characterized 40 isolates from each sample. We surveyed serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies reacting with any of a panel of 21 periodontal bacteria. The mother and 7 of her 13 children had early-onset periodontitis. Bacteroides gingivalis was not detected in the subgingival flora of any affected or unaffected family member, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from only one affected child. Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated from five of seven affected children and from none of their normal siblings. We found no significant differences among the floras from family members who had rapidly progressive, juvenile, and prepubertal forms of periodontitis. Elevated levels of serum antibody reacting with one or more of the bacteria tested were found in all family members with disease, but in only one periodontally normal family member. Both children with prepubertal periodontitis had antibodies reacting with C. sputigena, a species not found in their subgingival floras, but with none of the other bacteria tested. All remaining affected family members had antibodies to one or more serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and four had antibodies reacting with additional bacteria, including C. sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Haemophilus aphrophilus. Sera from patients contained antibodies specific for putative periodontal pathogens not found in their pocket flora, and conversely, putative periodontal pathogens for which no serum antibodies were found frequently comprised a large proportion (10% or more) of the pocket flora. In no case were both the bacterium and its antibody found. These observations are suggestive of sequential infection in the early-onset forms of periodontitis and of induction of protective immunity against reinfection by the same microorganism.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Gram negative species associated with active destructive periodontal lesions.
AB  - Apical subgingival plaque samples were taken from 19 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal disease. The predominant cultivable Gram negative species from 50 active sites were compared to 69 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. Active disease sites were chosen which showed a significant loss of attachment within a two-month interval. Proportions of Gram negative rods were higher in active periodontal disease sites than in inactive sites. Species which were found to be significantly elevated only in active sites were Bacteroides intermedius, "fusiform" Bacteroides, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Wolinella recta. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Eikenella corrodens were found in significantly increased proportions in active sites of some subjects and inactive sites of others.
TI  - Clinical appearance of orofacial infections of odontogenic origin in relation to  microbiological findings.
AB  - Fifty-eight patients with acute orofacial infections of odontogenic origin were classified into two groups with respect to the severity of infection. A total of 174 anaerobic and 22 aerobic bacterial strains were isolated. Anaerobic gram-negative rods were isolated more frequently from the patients with severe infections than from the patients with infections judged as mild (P less than 0.05). The occurrence of Fusobacterium nucleatum especially appeared to be associated with the severity of the infections (P less than 0.05). Penicillin resistance among the anaerobes was rarely found, while resistance to erythromycin was a common finding. All aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were susceptible to clindamycin, and all obligate anaerobic bacteria were susceptible to nitroimidazoles.
TI  - Identification of fusobacteria in a routine diagnostic laboratory.
AB  - A scheme for differentiating Fusobacterium spp. and Leptotrichia spp. from Bacteroides spp. was devised after examining 114 strains of fusobacteria and asaccharolytic bacteroides (17 reference strains and 97 clinical isolates). Sensitivity to a 300 micrograms/ml plate of phosphomycin and an acid reaction on a lysine plate were found to be reliable for differentiating Fusobacterium spp. and L. buccalis from Bacteroides. Using a short set of simple cultural and biochemical tests, isolates could be identified as F. necrophorum, F. necrogenes, F. nucleatum, F. varium or L. buccalis. These tests were: indole, lecithinase, phosphatase, DNase and gas production, aesculin and casein hydrolysis, greening of casein/methylene blue agar, nitrite reduction, bile tolerance and haemolysis on horse blood agar.
TI  - Reaction of human sera from juvenile periodontitis, rapidly progressive periodontitis, and adult periodontitis patients with selected periodontopathogens.
AB  - The levels of serum antibody reactive to selected periodontopathogens were determined in 182 clinically characterized patients: 35 healthy control, 50 juvenile periodontitis, 42 adult periodontitis and 55 rapidly progressive periodontitis. Reactive antibody levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations of Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga (Bacteroides) ochraceus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Y-4) serving as antigens. Increased reactivity to B. gingivalis and F. nucleatum was observed in all three disease groups studied while antibody reactive to A. actinomycetemcomitans was increased in juvenile and rapidly progressive periodontitis. Antibody levels reactive to C. ochraceus in healthy subjects did not differ from those observed in any disease patient groups. Possible implications in the etiology and progression of the diseases coupled with environmental changes which occur in the econiche of the periodontal pocket are described.
TI  - Survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  - Periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. One effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. Survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. The subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. When active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. The subjects were treated by modified Widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. On completion of therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. Life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. A site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". Survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. The subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. The annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. The hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2A) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2B) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. Group 2A and 2B individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. Many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides intermedius and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea and B. intermedius than the poor responding group. The latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius.
TI  - Characterization of a new beta-lactamase from Fusobacterium nucleatum by substrate profiles and chromatofocusing patterns.
AB  - Seven beta-lactamase-producing Fusobacterium nucleatum strains were isolated from patients with recurrent tonsillitis. The isolates were highly resistant to phenoxymethylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin and cloxacillin. They were all sensitive to cefaclor, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and imipenem. Penicillinase activity was found intracellularly after 20 h incubation. Specific activity of the unpurified penicillinase varied among the strains between 0.24-9.3 U/mg protein. The enzyme hydrolysed ampicillin and benzylpenicillin more rapidly than piperacillin. Cephalothin and imipenem were hydrolysed at rates less than 1% of benzylpenicillin. Chromatofocusing experiments eluted the beta-lactamases from all strains at a single peak between pH 5.1-5.2.
TI  - Activity of a peptidyl prodrug, alafosfalin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Alafosfalin, an antibacterial phosphonodipeptide requiring peptide transport for  activity, was tested for activity against clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria in peptide-free Roche Sensitivity Test Medium no. 5 agar. It was active against Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Clostridium perfringens but not against Clostridium difficile. Alafosfalin activity was antagonized by appropriate peptides. Synergy was obtained with other cell wall-active antibiotics.
TI  - Biologic activity of type I and type II Fusobacterium nucleatum isolates from clinically characterized sites.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum is a microorganism commonly cultured from periodontal disease sites. F. nucleatum isolates (120) were obtained from subgingival plaque samples taken from 27 clinically characterized sites using a selective culture medium. All isolates were verified by morphology, Gram-stain reactions, oxygen tolerance and biochemical reactions. A total of eight clinical isolates and two typed strains were used for further evaluation. In this study, there was no relationship found between GI and probing depth or between probing depth and frequency of isolation of Type I or Type II F. nucleatum colonies. There was a significant increase in isolation of Type II colonies with a GI of 2 (P less than 0.0001). All isolates tested shared lines of identity by double diffusion in agar and displayed similar ability to hemagglutinate sheep erythrocytes and a reduction in this hemagglutination activity by previous exposure to 50 mM D-galactose. All isolates tested showed similar protein patterns as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By the methods used, no differences were detected between Type I and Type II F. nucleatum; however, there was a statistically significant increase in Type II isolates with increasing levels of gingivitis.
TI  - Purification and properties of a novel beta-lactamase from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum which produced high levels of beta-lactamase  was isolated. The specific activity of the unpurified beta-lactamase was 7.8 U/mg of protein. By Sephacryl S-300 and S-200 column passage and chromatofocusing, the enzyme was purified 450-fold. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gradient gel electrophoresis revealed a single band. The enzyme hydrolyzed phenoxymethylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, and ampicillin more rapidly than carbenicillin and piperacillin. Cephaloridine, cefaclor, cephalothin, imipenem, and SCH 34343 had hydrolysis rates of less than or equal to 1% that of phenoxymethylpenicillin. The enzyme was inhibited by clavulanic acid and RO-15-1903/001 but not by p-mercuribenzoate or cefoxitin. Molecular weight by gel filtration was determined to be 21,000 and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gradient gel electrophoresis was determined to be 26,000. The amino acids aspartic acid-asparagine, glutamic acid-glutamine, serine, glycine, and lysine dominated the amino acid composition.

AB  
TI  - Microbial ecology of plaque in rats with naturally occurring gingivitis.
AB  - The microbial ecology of adherent plaque was investigated in relation to the pathological findings of gingivitis in plaque-susceptible rats. Plaque developed in the gingiva of the lower incisor in plaque-susceptible rats, but not in plaque-resistant rats, after they were fed a commercial powder diet. With increase in plaque volume, the total counts of bacteria increased 10(9) to 10(11)/g. In the first 3 months, Bacteroides species increased and became the predominant population. Streptococcus species also increased at the same time. After 9 months, Fusobacterium species and oral Treponema species were recognized in increasing numbers. The anaerobic bacteria increased in proportion with the progression of plaque development. Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus salivarius, and other species were isolated. Acute gingivitis was observed within 3 months, and subacute-chronic gingivitis was observed between 2 and 12 months. These findings suggest that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.
TI  - Serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.
AB  - In the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (SP). Subjects with SP were often seropositive for Eubacterium brachy, Fusobacterium nucleatum E3C22, and Peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (JP) and subjects with healthy periodontium (HP) were not. Both SP and JP subjects were more frequently seropositive for Bacteroides gingivalis, F. nucleatum D52B16, and F. nucleatum E1D1 than were HP subjects. The data were most striking for B. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for SP and JP subject groups. However, SP subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. In contrast, JP and HP subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. Except at very low levels of antibody, neither SP nor JP groups differed significantly from the HP group for antibody to Eubacterium nodatum, Bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or Lactobacillus minutus antibody. There was a high frequency of antibody to E. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite the fact that this organism is rarely found in HP subjects. For Eubacterium timidum, the JP group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the HP group. Despite high levels of L. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 SP subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the HP and JP subjects had detectable antibody. These results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. B. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. However, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., L. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.
TI  - Microbe-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis enhancement after preculture.
AB  - The in vitro blastogenic response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to  Fusobacterium nucleatum and other oral microorganisms was enhanced if the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 degrees C prior to the addition of stimulant. The enhancement which occurred at optimal and supraoptimal concentrations of F. nucleatum (10 to 100 micrograms/ml) was detected after a preculture period of as little as 2 h. The blastogenic response was a result of T-cell proliferation, and enhancement occurred independently of monocytes. Suppressor activity was induced by culturing fresh lymphocytes for 24 h in the presence of supraoptimal concentrations of F. nucleatum. The enhancement phenomenon occurred independently of the prostaglandin effects on lymphocyte blastogenesis and was not abrogated by treatment with indomethacin.
TI  - Cytotoxic effects of culture supernatants of oral bacteria and various organic acids on Vero cells.
AB  - Dilute culture filtrates of the three asaccharolytic black-pigmented Bacteroides  species as well as B. macacae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and animal strains resembling B. gingivalis were cytotoxic for the African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells). Butyric or propionic acid, major metabolic products of these bacteria, seem to be responsible for the characteristic morphological changes observed. Among the organic acids studied, only butyric, propionic, and valeric acids exhibited cytotoxic effects. Finally, cumulative effects (as opposed to synergistic) were observed when mixtures of two organic acids were tested.
TI  - Establishment of MICs of moxalactam for control and reference anaerobic organisms in agar dilution and microdilution techniques.
AB  - The MICs of moxalactam were determined for eight National Committee for Clinical  Laboratory Standards control and reference strains and for Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 by agar and microdilution techniques. The recommended MIC for the control strain Bacteroides fragilis in both agar and microdilution tests is 0.5 micrograms/ml. Recommended MICs for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 by agar dilution are 8 and 0.063 micrograms/ml, respectively. These two strains gave inconsistent results in microdilution tests. Variation in results with microdilution procedures was seen, which illustrates problems in reading endpoints and with modifications of media. Recommended MICs for the reference strains are presented.
TI  - Effects of a Fusobacterium nucleatum extract on immunoregulation in mice.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of an extract of Fusobacterium nucleatum on humoral and cell-mediated immunity and phagocyte functions in mice. The extract was obtained from the heat-inactivated supernatant of sonicated F. nucleatum. Mouse splenocytes were cultured with sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and antibody formation was assayed by counting the plaque-forming cells (PFC). After C3H mouse skin was grafted onto the BALB/c mouse, cytotoxicity of BALB/c mouse splenocytes to L-cells was enumerated, T- and B-cell blastogenesis was determined by the uptake of 3H-thymidine. In vivo phagocyte functions were measured using carbon clearance test, bactericidal, and acid phosphatase activity assays. The number of SRBC-specific and non-specific PFC in splenocytes stimulated with the extract increased 2.5-8.7-fold over that of unstimulated splenocytes. Cytotoxicity of splenocytes from the extract-injected mice decreased in a dose-dependent fashion at 12 days after grafting. T-cell mitogenicity of the extract was observed. The carbon clearance rate was reduced, and bactericidal and acid phosphatase activities were elevated by the extract injection of the mice. In conclusion, F. nucleatum extract has an adjuvant effect on humoral immunity, and a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity and activated phagocyte functions.
TI  - Fatty acid composition and Shwartzman activity of lipopolysaccharides from oral bacteria.
AB  - The composition and the nature of the linkage of fatty acids and the Shwartzman activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations derived from oral gram-negative bacteria including Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides loesheii, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were examined. 3-Hydroxylated and nonhydroxy fatty acids of various chain lengths were found in all of the LPS preparations. All nonhydroxy fatty acids were found to be ester-bound, and part of the 3-hydroxy fatty acids in the LPS of B. gingivalis, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were shown to be involved in ester linkage. It was also suggested that the hydroxy group of the ester-bound 3-hydroxy fatty acid of the LPS of F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans is at least partly substituted by another fatty acid, but in the LPS of B. gingivalis and E. corrodens it is not. The main amide-linked fatty acid of the LPS of B. gingivalis, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was 3-hydroxyheptadecanoic, 3-hydroxydodecanoic, 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic, and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, respectively. The results of the Shwartzman assay showed that the E. corrodens LPS was the most active among the preparations tested, and that the Shwartzman toxicity of Bacteroides LPS is extremely low.
TI  - Superinfected actinomycotic abscess of the liver.
AB  - Isolated actinomycotic liver abscess is rare. We report a case with fulminant evolution, which was treated successfully with surgery and penicillin. In human actinomycosis, Actinomyces israeli is the main infective agent. An abdominal localisation is uncommon, occurring in less than 25% of cases. Isolated liver lesions are extremely rare; their presence might be interpreted as the result of the hematogenous spread of a no longer present intestinal lesion. The evolution of actinomycosis is usually torpid. In the present case, mixed infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum might explain the acute evolution.
TI  - Surface structures (peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils) found on Streptococcus sanguis strains may be related to their ability to coaggregate with other oral genera.
AB  - We screened 36 strains of Streptococcus sanguis biotype I and 8 strains of S. sanguis biotype II for the presence of surface structures and for their ability to coaggregate with Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Negative staining under an electron microscope revealed detectable surface structures on all S. sanguis strains. The majority of strains (38 of 44) carried peritrichous fibrils, which have an irregular profile and no distinct width. They usually appeared as a fringe with a constant width around the cell. Strains selected for measurement had a fringe with an average length of 72.4 +/- 8.5 nm on biotype I strains and 51.6 +/- 3.3 nm on biotype II strains. Some fibrillar biotype I strains carried an additional, longer (158.7 +/- 33.1 nm) type of fibril projecting through the shorter fibrils. Fibrillar density was characteristic for each strain, ranging from very dense on all cells in a population to very sparse on a few cells in a population. A small group of six strains carried tufts of fibrils in a lateral or polar position on the cell. Either one or two lengths of fibril were present in the tuft depending on the strain. One strain carried both peritrichous fibrils and fimbriae. Fimbriae are flexible structures with a constant width (4.5 to 5.0 nm) all along their length but very variable lengths (less than or equal to 0.7 micron) on each cell. S. sanguis I and II both included strains with peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils, but the mixed morphotype strain was confined to biotype II. Fibrils were present on cells at all stages throughout the growth cycle for the strains tested. Freshly isolated fibrillar strains coaggregated consistently well with A. viscosus and A. naeslundii, although some fibrillar reference strains lacked the ability. In addition, all tufted strains could not coaggregate, but the strains with the mixed morphotype coaggregated well. Coaggregation with F. nucleatum was very strong for the fibrillar strains, but less strong for the tufted strains. We discuss the possible correlation between S. sanguis surface structure and ability to coaggregate.
TI  - Beta-lactamases in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins and blocked penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is production of beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamases in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Clostridium species have been described. Beta-lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is most commonly mediated by beta-lactamase production mainly of cephalosporinase character. Recent studies have also shown that B. fragilis can produce a penicillinase which inactivates piperacillin and carbenicillin. Enzymes inactivating cefoxitin and imipenem have also been isolated from B. fragilis. The Bacteroides non-fragilis species produce beta-lactamases of mainly penicillinase character. Recently a penicillinase from Fusobacterium nucleatum has been characterized. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, C. clostridiiformis and C. ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.
TI  - Adhesion of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria to mucosal surfaces.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and black-pigmented Bacteroides species adhere to red blood cells and crevicular epithelium. The attachment of the bacteroides, but not F. nucleatum, is associated with the presence of fimbriae-like structures on the bacterial surface. Such structures have been observed also in unencapsulated Bacteroides fragilis able to adhere to human red cells and cheek epithelium. Encapsulated B. fragilis adheres to porcine brush borders, but the number of adhering cells per brush border fragment is low.
TI  - Nature and location of amide-bound (R)-3-acyloxyacyl groups in lipid A of lipopolysaccharides from various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - It has previously been demonstrated [Eur. J. Biochem. 124, 191-198 (1982) and 137, 15-22 (1983)] that the lipid A component of Salmonella and Proteus lipopolysaccharides contains amide-linked (R)-3-acyloxyacyl residues. In the present study lipid A of other gram-negative bacteria was analysed for the presence of amide-bound 3-acyloxyacyl residues. It was found that such residues are constituents of all lipid A tested (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas sinensis, Bacteroides fragilis, Vibrio cholerae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Rhodospirillum tenue, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Escherichia coli). Amide-linked (R)-3-acyloxyacyl groups, therefore, represent common and ubiquitous structural elements of bacterial lipid A. The composition of 3-acyloxyacyl groups differed considerably among different bacteria. As amide-bound (R)-3-hydroxy fatty acids straight chain and isobranched acyl groups with 10-17 carbon atoms were identified. The most frequently encountered fatty acids, substituting the 3-hydroxyl group of 3-hydroxy fatty acids, were nonhydroxylated straight chain and isobranched acyl residues with 10-17 carbon atoms as well as (S)-2-hydroxy fatty acids with 12 carbon atoms. In some cases, using laser desorption mass spectrometry, the distribution of 3-acyloxyacyl residues over the two available glucosamine amino groups of the lipid A backbone was investigated.
TI  - Monocyte suppression of Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced human polyclonal B-lymphocyte activation.
AB  - Previous studies reported that Fusobacterium nucleatum induced polyclonal B-lymphocyte activation (PBA) as determined by immunoglobulin M production in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, the PBA response was greatly enhanced when the cells were depleted of esterase-positive, adherent cells (i.e., monocytes). The purpose of this study was to confirm and further examine the suppression of F. nucleatum-induced PBA (F. nucleatum-PBA) by blood monocytes. For comparison, PBA induced by pokeweed mitogen (PWM-PBA), which is enhanced by monocytes, was assessed in some experiments. We found the removal of monocytes from unfractionated cells by (i) Sephadex G-10, (ii) anti-monocyte specific OM-1 monoclonal antibody plus complement, or (iii) L-leucine methyl ester, a compound which selectively kills lysosome-rich cells, resulted in a population of cells responsive to F. nucleatum-PBA and unresponsive to PWM-PBA. The addition of double adherence-purified monocytes (greater than 85% esterase-positive cells), particularly in concentrations of greater than 10%, to lymphocytes depleted of monocytes by G-10, OM-1, or L-leucine methyl ester treatments, suppressed F. nucleatum-PBA and enhanced PWM-PBA. Monocytes also suppressed a mixture of isolated T and B cells combined in a T/B cell ratio of 3:1, which is an optimal ratio for F. nucleatum-PBA. Allogeneic monocytes suppressed F. nucleatum-PBA, although at low numbers these cells were not as suppressive as autologous monocytes. Heating at 56 degrees C for 15 min, sonicating, or freeze-thawing the monocyte preparations resulted in an abrogation of monocyte-induced suppression of F. nucleatum-PBA. Kinetic studies in which fresh monocytes were added daily to lymphocytes stimulated with F. nucleatum or PWM showed that the monocytes must be added within the first 2 days of culture to suppress F. nucleatum-PBA or enhance PWM-PBA. Monocytes incubated with F. nucleatum for 48 h released into the culture medium a soluble factor that suppressed F. nucleatum-PBA. The results from this study demonstrate a potent mechanism by which the host might prevent exaggerated nonspecific immunoglobulin responses when exposed to PBA-inducing concentrations of F. nucleatum. On the other hand, the induction of suppressive monocytes (or monocyte-mediated suppressive factors) by interaction with F. nucleatum might result in the inhibition of host protective immune reactions.
TI  - Bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in children.
AB  - Children are more resistant to gingivitis than are adults. To determine possible  differences in their periodontal floras, an experimental gingivitis study, identical in design to one reported earlier with young adults, was conducted with four 4- to 6-year-old children. The incidence of sites that developed gingival index scores of 2 in children was less than one-third of the incidence observed in adults. The composition of the flora of each child was statistically significantly different from that of any other child or adult. The floras of the children as a group were statistically significantly different from those of the adults. Children had 3-fold greater proportions of Leptotrichia species, 2.5-fold greater proportions of Capnocytophaga species, 2.3-fold greater proportions of Selenomonas species, 2-fold greater proportions of bacterial species that require formate and fumarate, and 1.5-fold greater proportions of Bacteroides species. Adults had greater proportions of Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces WVa 963, Selenomonas D04, and Treponema socranskii were predominant species that correlated with increasing gingival index scores in both children and adults.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. The subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. Using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. Active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. The control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. Bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. Similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. The proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of Bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. sputigena and Eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of B. intermedius and E. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species had increased. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. The proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis II and Campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. Humoral antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena significantly increased in a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. Antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. Crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Immunologic profile of juvenile periodontitis. I. Lymphocyte blastogenesis and the autologous mixed lymphocyte response.
AB  - Studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (JP) patients have been inconclusive. Experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in JP and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were performed. Variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of DNA which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (LJP) and generalized (GJP) forms of JP patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Y-4), Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochraceus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis and Treponema denticola. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (AMLR) were increased for LJP compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures of GJP were decreased compared to healthy subjects and LJP (P less than 0.05). These observations indicate that GJP patients may have abnormalities in T- and B-lymphocyte regulatory mechanisms.
TI  - Antitumor activity of sediment fractions from Fusobacterium nucleatum culture supernatant.
AB  - The present study was carried out to examine antitumor activity of extracts from  Fusobacterium nucleatum culture supernatant. The extracts were prepared as sediment fractions by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric point precipitation and proteolytic enzyme-treatment. An ethanol fraction obtained by addition of 60% ethanol to the culture supernatant showed effective antitumor activity to ascites and solid type tumor of Ehrlich carcinoma and also to solid type tumor of Sarcoma 180 in ICR mice. A sediment fraction extracted by adjusting an ethanol fraction to pH 4.0 was also found to give distinctive antitumor activity to Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. This fraction was further treated with pronase to eliminate free nucleotides, and then ultrafiltrated. The pronase-treated fraction gave better antitumor activity to both ascites and solid type tumor of Ehrlich carcinoma or Sarcoma 180. The ratios (%) indicating antitumor activity ranged from 131 to 188% even at 4-8 weeks after the tumor cell inoculation.
TI  - Immunoglobulin G response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  - Serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin G antibodies to antigens from Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Bacteroides intermedius 24, Bacteroides loescheii ATCC 15930, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Eikenella corrodens 1073, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, and Capnocytophaga sp. strain M-12. Immunoglobulin G antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antibody levels to B. gingivalis in serum and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. Although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin G levels to B. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. The antibodies to F. nucleatum (P less than 0.05), E. corrodens (P less than 0.05), and A. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. There were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to B. intermedius, B. loescheii, and Capnocytophaga sp.
TI  - [Amniotic infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum].
AB  
TI  - Suppression of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including urinary tract infections, bacteremia, pericarditis, otitis media, and disorders of the oral cavity such as pulpal infections, alveolar bone abscesses, and periodontal disease. In this study, we examined sonic extracts of F. nucleatum strain FDC 364 for its ability to alter human lymphocyte function. We found that the soluble cytoplasmic fraction (CF) of the sonic extract was able to cause a dose-dependent inhibition of human lymphocyte responsiveness to Con A, PHA, PWM, and the recall antigen SKSD. Suppression involved altered DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; there was no effect on cell viability. The suppressive activity is nondialyzable and heat labile. To achieve maximal suppression in 96-hr cell cultures, the CF had to be added to cells during the first 24 hr of incubation. Inhibition was reduced when the CF was added at 48 hr, and no suppression was observed when addition was at 72 or 96 hr (along with [3H]TdR). Furthermore, cells could be protected from the suppressive effects of the CF by washing within 24 hr of exposure. Suppression did not involve nonspecific effects on thymidine utilization. Although the mechanism of action of the F. nucleatum immunosuppressive activity has not yet been determined, we can rule out a requirement for monocytes/macrophages and activation of T suppressor cells. It has been proposed that impaired host defense may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of many diseases. The data presented in this paper suggest that local and/or systemic immunosuppression could be initiated by F. nucleatum. This immunosuppression may alter the nature and consequences of host-parasite interactions, thereby enhancing the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum itself or that of some other opportunistic organism.
TI  - Aetiological agents of necrobacillosis in captive wallabies.
AB  - In a series of 27 wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus) with necrobacillosis, 14 animals were affected in the face, nine in the leg and six in the internal organs, two being affected in more than one site. Fusobacterium necrophorum was the predominating organism, occurring in 69 per cent of lesions, usually in heavy and occasionally in pure culture. Bacteroides species (six in all), often in considerable numbers, were found in 48 per cent of lesions, and F nucleatum in 14 per cent. Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, usually in small numbers, were present in 59 per cent of lesions. The organisms isolated often varied considerably from one part of the lesion to another.
TI  - Isolation of a major cell envelope protein from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A major, heat-modifiable cell envelope protein was identified in Fusobacterium nucleatum FDC 364 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein, designated HM-1, had apparent molecular weights of 38,500 and 50,000 when heated in sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 and 100 degrees C, respectively. Whole cells were labeled with 125I, and the results suggested that the HM-1 protein may be exposed on the bacterial surface. The HM-1 protein was isolated in association with the peptidoglycan by extraction of whole cells or cell envelopes with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 55 degrees C. Heating the peptidoglycan-HM-1 protein complex in the detergent at 100 degrees C resulted in the quantitative release of the protein. Isoelectric focusing experiments and amino acid analysis revealed that the HM-1 protein had a basic character and was moderately hydrophilic. Various strains of F. nucleatum as well as three oral fusiform isolates contained a serologically related protein. The abundance and location of the HM-1 protein in F. nucleatum suggest that it has the potential to participate in cell surface-related interactions of this bacterium.
TI  - The pathogenic properties of Fusobacterium and Bacteroides species from wallabies and other sources.
AB  - Intracerebral inoculation was more effective than intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation as a means of producing lethal infections with Fusobacterium necrophorum in mice. Strains varied in virulence but, of five examined, two had LD50 values as low as ca. 8000 and 14000 viable organisms. Profuse bacterial multiplication in the brain was demonstrated. Intravenous vaccination with a single large dose of heat-killed whole culture or washed bacterial cells failed to protect against intracerebral challenge. Intracerebral injection of other fusobacteria (F. nucleatum, F. varium and F. necrogenes) and of 22 strains belonging to 10 Bacteroides spp. was without apparent effect on mice, except for a slight transient illness in some animals given B. fragilis. This organism (five strains) differed from the other Bacteroides spp. tested, which included eight strains belonging to the fragilis group, in being eliminated more slowly from the mouse brain--a point that may be relevant to the special pathogenicity of B. fragilis in endogenous infections in man. There was no evidence that B. fragilis multiplied in the brain or that intravenous vaccination with a large dose of heat-killed homologous culture affected the rate at which it was eliminated.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human lysozyme toward Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1.
AB  - Human lysozyme in physiologic concentrations (17-50 micrograms/ml) had apparently no effects on growth rate and viability of exponentially growing Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 cells, but cells in the stationary phase were affected. When grown in the presence of active lysozyme about 70% of the cells in late exponential phase (24-h culture) were able to form colonies, compared to about 100% in the control culture. About 24 h later the colony forming abilities were about 5% and 20%, respectively. Addition of lysozyme to suspensions of cells taken from any growth phase did not lead to any significant decrease in turbidity, that is, no more than 10% decrease at 650 nm. Control cells treated with acridine orange fluoresced with a uniform bright orange color, while the lysozyme treated stationary phase cells fluoresced more faintly. Intracellular granules were more preponderant in the latter cells. When incubated with the hydrophobic probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS), lysozyme exposed cells gave approximately 20% higher fluorescence intensity than the control cells. Changes in the ultrastructure of the lysozyme treated cells were best studied in the transmission electron microscope using ultrathin sectioned preparations. The peptidoglycan layer became disorganized and apparently dissolved and the ordered structure of the cell wall had disappeared in zones. The cells, however, still retained their form, and only a few per cent had lost their cellular content. This explains why the turbidity of the solution did not change significantly.
TI  - [Susceptibility of potential periodontopathic bacteria to metronidazole, spiramycin and their combination].
AB  - A total of 65 bacterial strains originating mostly from subgingival plaque were tested for their susceptibilities to metronidazole, spiramycin, and their combination, ornidazole, erythromycin and tetracycline by means of an agar dilution technique. All agents were active against all anaerobic Gram-negative rods. Bacteroides gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed marked susceptibility to metronidazole (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) whereas 4-64 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit the capnophilic Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga. Gram-positive facultatives were resistant to nitro-imidazoles but were inhibited at macrolide concentrations less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. Except for F. nucleatum and Veillonella strains (2 less than or equal to MIC less than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml) macrolides were active against all other anaerobic bacteria tested. At concentrations less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole (2 : 1) was active against virtually all bacteria tested but our results failed to show a synergistic effect.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from vented blood-culture bottles.
AB  - From January 1979, to July 1981, blood from each patient suspected of having bacteremia was collected in two bottles of commercially prepared tryptic soy broth; one bottle was vented for 24 hr to the atmosphere. Bottles were incubated at 37 degrees C for a maximum of seven days and were examined daily for signs of growth. Blind subcultures onto chocolate-agar plates were performed 18-24 hr after collection and again at 48 hr. For 63,106 bottles inoculated, a total of 4,788 strains were isolated, for a rate of 6.4% (excluding contaminants). Two hundred and thirty (4.8%) isolates were anaerobes, of which 75 (33%) were identified as Bacteroides fragilis. It is significant that 20 of these anaerobic isolates (approximately 9%) were recovered only from the vented bottles. These included eight strains of B. fragilis; three strains of Clostridium perfringens; and one strain each of Bacteroides distasonis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium species. These results emphasize the need to check vented bottles for anaerobes, since significant numbers of these bacteria could be missed by failing to do so. These data further show the desirability of holding anaerobic blood cultures for a minimum of one week.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  - The etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., Pasteurella multocida. While anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. Most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. In a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. Anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. Several species of anaerobes usually were present in the wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. The anaerobes most commonly isolated included Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides disiens, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides ruminicola, Bacteroides pneumosintes, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium russii, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Veillonella species. Initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.
TI  - Osteomyelitis in dogs and cats caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Localised osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 2 dogs and 2 cats. The disease was caused by fight wounds in 3 cases. Radiographic examination demonstrated a circumscribed zone of cortical bone lysis, sequestra and periosteal new bone. Each case was treated surgically by sequestrectomy and debridement. Infection was due mainly to anaerobic bacteria. The pathogenic bacteria isolated from the lesions of dogs were Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides spp, and from the lesions in cats were Clostridium villosum , Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Wolinella recta and Bacteroides gingivalis. As all the bacteria were sensitive to penicillin, each case was treated with penicillin and by irrigation of the wound. This resulted in resolution of the disease, within 4 weeks, in all cases.
TI  - The effect of storage in liquid nitrogen on the recovery of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Centrifuged deposits of various individual bacteria from type-culture collections and dental plaque samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for periods of up to 2 years. All the organisms were recovered after storage in liquid nitrogen but Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953) and Campylobacter fetus (NCTC 10354) consistently showed a reduction in the number of colony-forming units after freezing. The main effect on bacterial proportions in plaque samples was a reduction in aerobic Gram-negative cocci. Thus, storage in liquid nitrogen may be useful for comparative studies of dental plaque and as a means of storing individual organisms.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of four antibiotics in anaerobic pulmonary infection. An experimental model in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of cefoxitin, mezlocillin, latamoxef and metronidazole in anaerobic  lung infection was studied using a rabbit model. A mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus morbillorum, Eubacterium lentum and Fusobacterium nucleatum was inoculated transtracheally to produce infection within the lung. Mezlocillin was most effective, achieving bacteriologic cure in 5 out of 8 animals. With cefoxitin therapy, 4 out of 8 became bacteriologically sterile. Severe diarrhea with elevated titers of Clostridium difficile toxin was noted in most cefoxitin-treated animals. Latamoxef- and metronidazole-treated animals had apparently healed lesions, but cultures were positive in 6 and 7 out of 8 in each group, respectively. The commonest pathogen isolated in the last two groups was P. morbillorum. The therapeutic superiority of mezlocillin over metronidazole and latamoxef was statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05).
TI  - Death of an African elephant from probable toxemia attributed to chronic pulpitis.
AB  - A 31-year-old captive male African elephant (Loxodonta africana) of 5,000-kg body weight died suddenly in ventral recumbency. Lesions seen at necropsy were bilateral purulent pulpitis and periodontitis of both tusks, serous atrophy of coronary groove fat, Grammocephalus cholangitis, myocardial and skeletal lipofuscinosis, and scattered segmental necrosis in the pectoral muscles. Nonhemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium sp, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides sp, were recovered from the exudate around one or both tusks. We postulated that the elephant died of hypoxia from prolonged ventral recumbency because of weakness and inability to rise secondary to toxemia from bilateral pulpitis and periodontitis.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid and soluble protein profiles of oral fusobacteria.
AB  - We compared the cellular fatty acid and protein content of 43 strains of oral fusobacteria isolated from patients with chronic gingivitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, and juvenile and adult periodontitis, as well as from the stump-tailed macaque, to that of eight reference strains of oral and non-oral Fusobacterium species. A gas-liquid chromatographic examination of trimethylsilyl derivatives of the fatty acid methyl esters revealed n14:0, 3-OH-14:0, n16:0, 16:1, 3-OH-16:0, n18:0, and 18:1 in each of the 51 study strains, and a variable occurrence of 14 other fatty acids. The n16:0 to 3-OH-16:0 ratio distinguished between Fusobacterium nucleatum and the non-oral species Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium russii, Fusobacterium necrogenes, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium naviforme. The soluble protein content, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, varied considerably among the oral fusobacterial strains studied, and underscored the heterogenous nature of these organisms. "Fingerprinting" of oral fusobacteria may be readily accomplished by polypeptide analysis.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. Sampling was by syringe aspiration. Strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. Randomly selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. Seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. One abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, Streptococcus milleri. Streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. The common oral streptococcus, Streptococcus sanguis, constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, other Bacteroides including B. oralis and B. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
TI  - Antitumor activity in the culture supernatant fluid of Fusobacterium nucleatum strain KO-31.
AB  - Antitumor activity of Fusobacterium nucleatum strain KO-31, which had been isolated from the oral cavity, was investigated in Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice. The strain KO-31 was cultured in TF medium for 48 hr. One-half ml of the culture supernatant fluid was injected intraperitoneally during a 7-day period to mice with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The survival time of the treated mice prolonged remarkably. A significant reduction in size of the solid Ehrlich tumor was also achieved with the supernatant. Antitumor activity was not observed in the cell extract.
TI  - Nonspecific induction of immunoglobulin M antibodies to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms after polyclonal human B-lymphocyte activation by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The production of antibodies to oral bacteria was determined in lymphocyte cultures stimulated with sonicated Fusobacterium nucleatum, a potent inducer of polyclonal B-cell activation. After 9 days the cultures were examined by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to F. nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Antibodies to these four bacteria were detected in cultures stimulated with polyclonal B-cell activation-inducing concentrations of F. nucleatum. However, significant concentrations of antibodies to F. nucleatum, but not to the other three microorganisms, were produced in cultures that received suboptimal polyclonal B-cell activation-inducing doses of F. nucleatum. Absorption studies indicated the specificity of the antibodies to each of the bacteria tested. IgM antibody production induced by F. nucleatum was enhanced by the addition of T cells. The production of IgM antibodies to the bacteria was reproducible in cultures from a single person tested on 3 consecutive days. The concentration of antibodies in replicate cultures, however, fluctuated greatly. To obtain consistent responses on successive days, multiple replicate cultures were required. These results suggest that F. nucleatum, which is frequently present in subgingival plaque, could induce the production of antibodies not only to F. nucleatum, but also to other microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases.
TI  - Immunologic studies of endodontic disease: measurement by the ELISA technique of  antibody reactive with Fusobacterium nucleatum in the serum of endodontic patients.
AB  
TI  - [Proportion and frequency of 3 kinds of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the gingival index].
AB  - The proportion and frequency of three groups of particular bacteria (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and spirochetes) were studied in relation to the gingival index on the sites from which they were sampled. Seventy eight samples collected from 40 individuals were studied together with measurements of the gingival index and the pocket or sulcus depth. The samples were dispersed by ultrasonic treatment, diluted and cultured on a non-selective medium. The identification of the species was done by biochemical tests and by analysis of the metabolic products with gas chromatography. As a whole, our results support the hypothesis of an important change in the microbial flora from a clinical healthy status (with predominant Gram positive facultative anaerobic bacteria) to disease (with predominant Gram negative strict anaerobic bacteria). Furthermore the results suggest that Bacteroides gingvalis as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum and spirochetes through their high frequency and important proportion at the affected sites played an etiological role in the pathogenesis of gingivitis and periodontis Man.
TI  - Effect of factors other than pathologic status on responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Studies were designed to assess factors other than pathologic status of the cell  donor which affect the blastogenic responsiveness in vitro of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMs) from normal donors and patients with periodontitis. Cultures were established and activated using phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA) or homogenates of Actinomyces viscosus (AVIS), a gram-positive plaque microorganism, and Fusobacterium nucleatum (FUSO), a gram-negative plaque microorganism. Activation was assessed by measuring the incorporation of labeled precursor into DNA. The effects of incubation time, vessel shape, cell concentration, prostaglandin E2 and indomethacin on blastogenic responsiveness were studied. Blastogenic responsiveness became maximal after 5 to 8 days' activation with the bacterial substances, and after 3 days' activation with PHA. Radioactivity incorporated by cultures in microtest wells with flat, round and conical bottoms was 5.9, 7.8 and 10.6 X 10(3) cpm, respectively. Cultures of cells from all of the patients and normal subjects were activated by PHA, AVIS and FUSO, and cell concentration was a major determinant of the magnitude of the blastogenic response. Responsiveness of cultures from all patients and control subjects activated with AVIS and FUSO was inhibited significantly by prostaglandin E-2 (PGE2) at a concentration of 10 microM. Inhibition was generally 50% or greater. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production, at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml significantly enhanced responsiveness of AVIS- and FUSO-activated cultures from control donors and patients, indicating that prostaglandins are produced endogenously, and that they affect cell responsiveness. The effect of PGE2 and indomethacin on PHA-activated cultures was more variable and, where present, of a lesser magnitude than that observed for cultures activated with bacterial homogenates. In most cultures the effects were not statistically significant. Our data show that in studies of lymphocyte activation, the incubation time, culture-vessel shape, cell concentration and presence of endogenous inhibitors need to be taken into account.
TI  - Polyclonal activation of human peripheral blood B lymphocytes by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The present study examined in vitro polyclonal human B-lymphocyte (B-cell) activation (PBA) by Fusobacterium nucleatum. Pokeweed mitogen, a well-studied PBA activator, was included in some experiments for comparison. PBA was determined by the total immunoglobulin A, G, and M concentrations in the culture supernatants as measured by micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. F. nucleatum, at concentrations between 1 and 10 micrograms/ml, stimulated optimal PBA in monocyte-depleted cultures, whereas the pokeweed mitogen response was optimal in unfractionated, monocyte-containing cultures. Immunoglobulin synthesis occurred primarily between days 6 and 8 after stimulation with F. nucleatum. T lymphocytes enhanced the PBA response to F. nucleatum, particularly at a T- to B-cell ratio of 1:1. Immunoglobulin production was greater in round-bottomed wells than in flat-bottomed wells at lymphocyte concentrations of 200,000 cells per well. The PBA response, however, increased dramatically in flat-bottomed wells containing higher lymphocyte concentrations, suggesting that PBA is enhanced by cell-to-cell contact. A delay in stimulation of the lymphocytes with F. nucleatum resulted in diminished immunoglobulin production. The results provide information on the regulation of in vitro PBA induced by F. nucleatum. The data also suggest that there may be differences in the mechanisms by which F. nucleatum and pokeweed mitogen stimulate PBA.
TI  - Relationships among the oral fusobacteria assessed by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - DNA was purified from 16 strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and from five strains representing other Fusobacterium species. The relationships among fusobacteria were examined by DNA-DNA hybridization and by determining the guanine plus cytosine content of the DNA. F. nucleatum was found to comprise a heterogenous group of organisms related to Fusobacterium periodonticum and Fusobacterium simiae, but unrelated to any of the other species of Fusobacterium tested.
TI  - [Studies of mixed anaerobic infections involving Bacteroides gingivalis].
AB  - The infectiousness of several combinations of bacteria containing Bacteroides gingivalis and other bacteria associated with periodontal diseases was evaluated by subcutaneous injection to guinea pigs. Among the seven mixtures studied, only one permitted the development of an infection easily transmissible to a second guinea pig; this bacterial mixture was composed of B. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium saburreum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea (formerly Bacteroides ochraceus). Owing to its ability to synthesize many lytic enzymes and potentially cytotoxic products, B. gingivalis represented the most virulent species of the mixture. Results from in vitro studies suggest that the development of B. gingivalis in the infected animal depends on the growth of C. ochracea. Succinic acid produced in large amount by C. ochracea seems to be one of the growth factors used by B. gingivalis.
TI  - Isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans Rm-10.
AB  - An extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of Streptococcus mutans Rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. There was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. Vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. It was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase C. The inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions of the bactericidal material. The results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. Activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. It was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Comparison of serological reactions of typed Fusobacterium nucleatum strains with those of isolates from humans, canines, and a Macaca mulatta monkey.
AB  - In the present study, we compared typed F. nucleatum strains with isolates from various human periodontal diseases, canines, and a Macaca mulatta monkey. All isolates displayed biochemical reactions similar to those of the typed strains in the API 20A system (Analytab Products, Plainville, N.Y.). The human and monkey isolates displayed both type I and type II colonial morphologies on crystal violet erythromycin agar, whereas the canine isolates displayed only type I. Antigen preparations of the human isolates, typed strains, and two of the monkey strains shared lines of identity in immunodiffusion testing. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which rabbit anti-F. nucleatum and human sera were used revealed that the human and monkey isolates, when used as antigens, allowed the detection of similar degrees of antibody activity; however, no activity was observed with the canine isolates. None of the canine isolates displayed the characteristic hemagglutination of sheep erythrocytes demonstrated by the human and monkey strains. These results suggest that F. nucleatum isolates from various human periodontal diseases share antigenic determinants. Also, differences were observed in F. nucleatum isolates from canines when compared with human and monkey strains. These findings are important when considering the immunopathological mechanisms involved in human periodontal diseases and when comparing animal model systems with naturally occurring disease in humans.
TI  - O-antigenic corss-reactivity in Fusobacterium nucleatum: chemotype V lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - nucleatum lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of chemotype V were examined for cross-reactivity by indirect haemagglutination in non-absorbed and absorbed antisera. At least three O-antigenic specificities were detected in LPS of five strains. There was a slight cross-reactivity between the LPS of chemotype V and those of chemotype II.
TI  - Corncob formation between Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Corncob formation in dental plaque was believed to be limited to strains of Bacterionema matruchotii and Streptococcus sanguis. We observed recently that strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum also interacted with S. sanguis to form corncobs. Since the fusobacteria are among the first anaerobic filaments to colonize subgingival plaque, these interactions could serve as a connecting link between the transformation of supra- to subgingival plaque. To further characterize these interactions, quantitative in vitro studies of the kinetics of corncob formation of the fusobacteria were undertaken. These studies indicated that fewer streptococci were needed to saturate F. nucleatum strain 364 compared to strain 10953. Corncob formation with both strains was enhanced with increasing pH up to pH 8, at which point autoaggregation of the streptococci occurred. Variation in ionic strength and divalent cations had little effect on the interaction, and EDTA suppressed aggregate formation only slightly. Detergents at concentrations above 0.05% also inhibited corncob formation. Electron micrographs suggested that attachment of the cocci to the fusiforms was mediated through localized tufts of fimbriae, as they are in the Bacterionema system. However, although both trypsin and heat treatment of the streptococci inhibited corncob formation with fusobacteria, the effects were not as complete as those seen in Bacterionema species. Unlike the Bacterionema model, trypsin and heat treatment of the fusobacteria resulted in inhibition of corncob formation. These results suggest that several different receptors may be involved in corncob formation.
TI  - Interaction of Ia antigen-bearing polymorphonuclear leukocytes and murine splenocytes.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were induced in the peritoneum of a Balb/c mouse by ip injection of Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) (greater than 95% PMN). A subpopulation of PMN harvested bore Ia surface antigens and stimulated a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) when cultured with C57B1/6J splenocytes. The reaction was blocked by a short prior incubation of PMN with anti-Ia antibody or PMN cell depletion by the same antibody plus complement. The Ia antigen-bearing PMN were capable of antigenic modulation since incubation of PMN for 24 h rendered the cells incapable of stimulating an MLR. The Ia antigen-bearing PMN produced a soluble material that enhanced the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) response of murine splenocytes and the active material was a product of live cells since the supernatants contained no detectable lactate dehydrogenase activity. The data suggest that murine PMN subpopulations, defined by surface Ia antigen, can modulate mitogenic responses by production of an enhancing factor(s).
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum pericarditis.
AB  - A pericardial effusion was diagnosed by echocardiography in a 49 year old man who suffered acute cough, orthopnea, and chest pain. Because of a positive tuberculin skin test, mycobacteria were initially suspected as the cause of the pericarditis. The patient was therefore treated with antituberculosis drugs. The pericardial effusion failed to resolve, however, and pericardiectomy was performed. Culture of the pericardial fluid yielded pure Fusobacterium nucleatum growth. The patient responded to antibiotic therapy and was in good health 3 weeks after being discharged from the hospital. This represents the first report of F. nucleatum pericarditis.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Penicillin failure in the treatment of Bacteroides fragilis lung abscess. Experimental study in rabbits.
AB  - Carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and clindamycin were compared with penicillin for the treatment of lung abscess in an animal model produced by transtracheal inoculation of a mixture of anaerobes: Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus morbillorum, Eubacterium lentum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Both chloramphenicol and doxycycline eliminated the bacteria but failed to close the abscess cavity. Carbenicillin, although it eradicated B. fragilis, failed to close the abscess cavity in 3 of 6 animals. In all animals tested, clindamycin sterilized the abscess cavities and healed the lung abscesses, while penicillin failed to eradicate the infection. Clindamycin was significantly more effective than penicillin in the elimination of anaerobic bacteria from the lung (p less than 0.05). Clindamycin also closed the abscess cavity faster than penicillin (p less than or equal to 0.02). The superior efficacy of clindamycin may have been the result of accumulation in the lung tissue in concentrations four- to eightfold higher than in the serum.
TI  - Treatment of anaerobic infections in children with metronidazole.
AB  - The tolerance and efficacy of metronidazole were studied in 15 pediatric patients who had anaerobic infection. 5 had soft tissue abscess, 4 had aspiration pneumonia, 3 had intracranial abscess and 3 had chronic sinusitis. 45 bacterial isolates were recovered (3 isolates per patient). 40 were anaerobes and included 17 Bacteroides sp. (8 sp.), 16 anaerobic cocci and 6 Fusobacterium nucleatum. Metronidazole was given intravenously at the dose of 30 mg/kd/day or orally in the dose of 40-50 mg/kg/day. The length of therapy was between 14 and 52 days (average 26 days). 7 of the patients received initial parenteral therapy for 5-21 days (average 11.6 days), and subsequently received oral therapy. The minimal inhibitory concentration of 38 of the 41 anaerobic isolates (93%) was equal or less than 2 micrograms/ml. The mean peak concentration of metronidazole on the third day of therapy was 24.2 micrograms/ml range 15.2-30 micrograms/ml) and the mean trough was 7.2 micrograms/ml (range 4-11.6 micrograms/ml). No local or systemic adverse reaction as noted. A good response to therapy with a complete cure occurred in 14 of the 15 children. A fair response was achieved in 1 patient. Metronidazole appears to be effective and safe in the treatment of serious anaerobic infection in children.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Haemolysis of human erythrocytes by the Fusobacterium nucleatum associated with periodontal disease.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides gingivalis are associated with oral disease. They both attach to haemagglutinate and human erythrocytes. Experiments were performed to determine whether haemolysis would occur following attachment of strains of F. nucleatum and Bacteroides species including B. gingivalis. The F. nucleatum strains consistently displayed both haemagglutination and haemolytic activity. The B. gingivalis strains and other Bacteroides species displayed haemagglutination but no measurable haemolytic activity. Varying the concentration of the F. nucleatum whole cells in the standard haemolysis assay suggested a F. nucleatum-erythrocyte binding site interaction. The haemolytic moiety was observed in various cell, cell wall and lipopolysaccharide extracts.
TI  - Anaerobic pulmonary infections.
AB  - The main cause of anaerobic pulmonary infections is aspiration of saliva, upper airway secretions of gastric content. Predisposing conditions include prominent dental disease, chronic upper respiratory tract infections and reduced consciousness. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci are the most frequently encountered organisms. The clinical presentations are lung abscess, lung gangrene and empyema, which all tend to take a slow and indolent course. Preferred localization are dependent lung segments, most often of the right side. For bacteriological examination in these infections, only transtracheal aspirate and aspirate from the lung or pleural space are considered adequate. In 26 cases of empyema treated in our hospital during the last 3 years, adequate specimens had been taken in 19. Fifteen had been adequately examined, and anaerobes were cultured in 6. Among 29 abscesses treated during the same period, adequate specimens had been taken in only 14, and 11 had been properly examined. Seven specimens grew anaerobes on culture. In prospective studies of transtracheal aspirate in 15 chronic bronchitis without emphysema, anaerobes were not demonstrated. In 11 patients with bronchiectasis, anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 3. Finally, no anaerobic bacteria could be demonstrated in the transtracheal aspirate from 76 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Anaerobic, pulmonary infections do not represent an intriguing medical problem in our region. However, knowledge of these infections is necessary to secure adequacy in collection of specimens and in their bacteriological examination. Except for metastatic infections, the key word for all lower respiratory infections is aspiration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The ELISA system for measuring antibody reactive to Fusobacterium nucleatum in the sera of patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Humoral IgG, IgA and IgM responses to three typed oral strains of F. nucleatum were examined in patients with chronic periodontitis and in individuals with clinically healthy gingiva. Attempts were made to isolate F. nucleatum from either the pathologic gingival crevices or healthy sulci in this study. Higher levels of IgG and IgA reactive to all three strains were observed in the chronic periodontitis patients; however, there were no differences between the IgM levels in the diseased and healthy individuals. Immunodiffusion studies with rabbit antiserum and adsorption studies of the human sera demonstrated a sharing of antigenic determinants by the F. nucleatum strains. F. nucleatum strains were isolated from 14 of the 15 individuals in the study.
TI  - Bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in young adult humans.
AB  - From replicate trials of experimental gingivitis in four periodontally healthy subjects, 166 bacterial species and subspecies were detected among 3,034 randomly selected isolates from 96 samples. Of these bacteria, Actinomyces naeslundii (serotype III and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), Actinomyces odontolyticus (serotype I and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus species D-2, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella parvula, and Treponema species A appeared to be the most likely etiological agents of gingivitis. Statistical interpretations indicated that the greatest source of microbiological variation of the total flora observed was person-to-person differences in the floras. The next greatest source of variation was the inflammatory status of the sample sites. Person-to-person differences were smallest at experimental day 4. The floras became more diverse with time and as gingivitis developed and progressed. Analyses indicated that sequential colonization by certain species was repeatable and therefore probably predictable. Variation was relatively small between replicate trials, between two sites on the same teeth sampled on the same day, and between the same sites sampled at the same relative time in a replicate trial.
TI  - Neutrophil chemiluminescence in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  
TI  - Pathogenic anaerobes.
AB  - Anaerobes are prevalent on all mucosal surfaces and virtually all anaerobic infections are endogenous. Two thirds of anaerobic infections involve five anaerobic organisms or groups--the Bacteroides fragilis group, the Bacteroides melaninogenicus-Bacteroides asaccharolyticus group, Fusobacterium nucleatum, the anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium perfringens. Conditions that lower the oxidation-reduction potential and disrupt the mucosal surface (eg, vascular problems, malignant neoplasms, and surgery) lead to infection with anaerobes. Clues to anaerobic infection include foul odor, gas, tissue destruction, underlying malignant neoplasms, and the unique appearance of certain anaerobes on Gram's stain. Specimens must be collected to avoid normal flora and transported to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions. Therapy involves surgical debridement and drainage and the use of various antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents must be used for extended periods to avoid relapse.
TI  - Extraction and properties of hemagglutinin from cell wall fragments of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - To study the hemagglutinin of Fusobacterium nucleatum, methods were sought to solubilize and purify this component. When cells of F. nucleatum were ruptured by passage through a French press, the fragments lost virtually all ability to agglutinate human erythrocytes. Extraction of the fragments with 2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 22 degrees C restored hemagglutinating activity (HA). Hemagglutination by these fragments could be inhibited by arginine, as can hemagglutination by intact bacteria. Treatment of active cell wall fragments with pronase and 2% Triton X-100-EDTA at 37 degrees C or with pronase and 0.1% Triton X-100-EDTA at pH 10.0 allowed recovery of solubilized HA. The former HA was inhibited by arginine (arg+) whereas the latter was not (arg-). Fractionation of the arg+ extract by preparative isoelectric focusing showed that HA was recovered from the gel sections having a pH between 4.5 and 5.5. Hemagglutination by this preparation was still arg+. Chromatography of this hemagglutinin on DEAE-Sephadex increased the specific activity to high levels with a loss of inhibition by arginine. A fraction from the DEAE-Sephadex column containing 10,700 HA units per mg of protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Solubilization at 22 degrees C before electrophoresis revealed three Coomassie blue-staining bands which migrated with apparent molecular weights of about 21,000, 38,000 and 60,000. When the same DEAE fraction was boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate, electrophoresis revealed only one band with an apparent molecular weight of 21,000.
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
TI  - The effect of long-term low-dose tetracycline therapy on the subgingival microflora in refractory adult periodontitis.
AB  - Twenty patients were selected for antibiotic treatment due to poor response to conventional therapy. Ten patients were evaluated after taking 250 mg/day of tetracycline for 2 to 7 years. Ten other patients who had been on tetracycline for at least 2 years were evaluated 6 months to 2 years after stopping the antibiotic. Subgingival plaque was cultured anaerobically on nonselective media (ETSA) and ETSA with 1 microgram/ml of tetracycline HCl. Pocket depth, plaque and gingivitis were scored. Those patients on tetracycline had no bleeding on probing despite residual pockets ranging from 3 to 7 mm. Gram-negative anaerobic rods made up to 49.8% of the microflora of these patients, with Fusobacterium nucleatum dominating. B. melaninogenicus, and B. gingivalis were not detected in the samples. Five of ten patients off tetracycline bled on probing and had pocket depths in the same range as those on tetracycline. The microflora of tetracycline-off sites was predominately Gram-negative rods (63.1% with B. gingivalis and F. nucleatum 7.3% and 3.1% of the flora respectively). In tetracycline-on samples 76.6% of the isolates were resistant to 1 microgram/ml of tetracycline compared to 25.9% in the patients off tetracycline and 7.1% resistant organisms in 14 untreated control samples from periodontitis patients not exposed to any long-term tetracycline therapy. Long-term, low-dose tetracycline was associated with a healthy clinical condition and diverse Gram-negative anaerobic flora resistant to the antibiotic. After discontinuing tetracycline the clinical and bacterial status was more characteristic of disease.
TI  - Pathway of lysine degradation in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Lysine was fermented by Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586 with the formation of  about 1 mol each of acetate and butyrate. By the use of [1-14C]lysine or [6-14C]lysine, acetate and butyrate were shown to be derived from both ends of lysine, with acetate being formed preferentially from carbon atoms 1 and 2 and butyrate being formed preferentially from carbon atoms 3 to 6. This indicates that the lysine carbon chain is cleaved between both carbon atoms 2 and 3 and carbon atoms 4 and 5, with the former predominating [1-14C]acetate was also extensively incorporated into butyrate, preferentially into carbon atoms 3 and 4. Cell-free extracts of F. nucleatum were shown to catalyze the reactions of the 3-keto,5-aminohexanoate pathway of lysine degradation, previously described in lysine-fermenting clostridia. The 3-keto,5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme was partially purified and shown to have properties much like those of the clostridial enzyme. We conclude that both the pathway and the enzymes of lysine degradation are similar in F. nucleatum and lysine-fermenting clostridia.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of human actinomykoses (author's transl)].
AB  - In the complex aetiology of human actinomykoses, various Actinomyces species, especially A. israelii, play the pathogenetically leading role in the mixed flora so typical for these diseases. A number of other microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria are also part of such mixed flora. Since these "concomitant" bacteria are themselves potentially pathogenic, it is important to have data on antibiotic sensitivity for the entire spectrum of microorganisms, to achieve effective and economic chemotherapy of human actinomykoses. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined for Actinomyces and the most important concomitant bacteria from actinomykotic processes: Actinobacillus actinomycetem-commitants, Bacteroides of the Melaninogenicus group, B. fragilis, B. theta-iotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium spp. and Propionibacteria. The results indicate that aminopenicillines are the drug of first choice, if in the actinomykoses there are no Bacteroides strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. These tests further indicate that clinically the combination of aminopenicillin and clindamycin, as well as aminopenicillin and metronidazol, are indicated. Minocycline and especially cefoxitin, a beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporin, inhibit with few exceptions all bacteria which are potentially involved in actinomykotic processes.
TI  - Immunochemical studies of partially hydrolyzed lipopolysaccharide from Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 LPS was split by hydrolysis with 1 per cent acetic acid into acid-soluble polysaccharide and lipid A. Gel filtration of the acid-soluble polysaccharide on Bio-Gel P-60 gave a high-molecular-weight fraction eluted with the void volume (Vo), and a fraction eluted at 2.4 x Vo. The high-molecular-weight fraction was serologically active, and contained glucose as the only sugar. The other fraction, which was serologically inactive, contained L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, galactose, glucosamine, keto-deoxy-octonate, and phosphorus. The fraction eluted at 2.4 x Vo is thought to constitute the polysaccharide core region, whereas the high-molecular-weight fraction may represent O-antigenic side chains.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  - BACTERIAL-NEUTROPHIL INTERACTIONS may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. Included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. Chemotaxis was measured using Boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. None of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. Capnocytophaga species., Bacteroides species., A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. Activity was lost after dialysis. Extracts of Bacteroides species, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. The exception was Capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. Such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
TI  - Humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  - Serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. With the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibody titers to isolates of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleation were determined. Antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes to B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, F. nucleatum, and S. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. No correlations were found with serum IgM titers. These findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes.
TI  - Predominant microflora associated with human dental periapical abscesses.
AB  - The microflora of periapical abscesses of teeth free of periodontal disease was studied. Permucosal aspiration of abscess contents and anaerobic cultural, microscopic, and biochemical techniques indicated a mixed but somewhat specific and relatively limited facultative and obligate anaerobic flora with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis as a frequent pair.
TI  - Capillary agar diffusion assay for measuring metronidazole in human gingival crevice fluid.
AB  - An agar diffusion assay in capillaries, with Fusobacterium nucleatum M2 as the indicator strain, has been developed to measure metronidazole concentrations in gingival crevice fluid. The assay allows the measurement of 1.9 micrograms of metronidazole per ml in sample amounts of 0.6 microliters.
TI  - Composition of peptidoglycans in Bacteroidaceae: determination and distribution of lanthionine.
AB  - Peptidoglycans of organisms belonging to the strictly anaerobic family Bacteroidaceae were investigated for the presence of lanthionine. Different procedures for the quantitation of lanthionine were compared. Performic acid and peroxide oxidation procedures on 35S-labeled peptidoglycan from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 resulted in low yields of cysteic acid (42 and 60%, respectively) and many other additional unidentified oxidation products. Lanthionine was, however, recovered in high yield (89% or more) from acid hydrolysates of unoxidized peptidoglycans. Lanthionine was found exclusively in some species of Fusobacterium, in particular F. nucleatum, F. necrophorum, F. russi, and F. gonidiaformans, for which lanthionine may be ascribed a function as a taxonomic marker. Peptidoglycans of these bacteria are thus proposed to belong to a new chemotype, assigned A1 delta. One strain of Fusobacterium, F. mortiferum VPI 0473 contained both lanthionine and diaminopimelic acid in about equal proportions. Species of F.plauti had a composition atypic of gram-negative cells. Chemotypic differences were also indicated among the species of Bacteroides investigated. Thus, some species contained lysine and not diaminopimelic acid as the major dibasic amino acid (e.g., F. asaccharolyticus). It is concluded that peptidoglycans of gram-negative organisms constitute a somewhat more heterogeneous group than hitherto assumed.
TI  - Plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  - Eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. Microorganisms studied included: Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (B. gingivalis), B. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, Capnocytophaga ochracea (B. ochraceus), and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Three B. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 Mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. Restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. In other microorganisms, including the Actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.

TI  - Chemoprophylaxis of anaerobic pulmonary infections. An experimental study in rabbits.
AB  - Chemoprophylaxis of anaerobic pulmonary infection due to aspiration was studied in a rabbit model with the view of comparing the efficacy of procaine penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline and cefoxitin. The antibiotic treatment was commenced immediately following transtracheal inoculation of a mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus morbillorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eubacterium lentum. Treatment was stopped after 48 h and lungs were examined for evidence of infection on the 10th day. Only clindamycin and carbencillin were highly efficacious in chemoprophylaxis and both drugs prevented pulmonary infection in 7 of 8 (87%) of the animals tested.
TI  - Attachment of cell fragments of Fusobacterium nucleatum to oral epithelial cells, gingival fibroblasts and white blood cells.
AB  - The characteristic haemagglutination (HA) caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum strains was used for measuring their attachment to oral epithelial, gingival fibroblast and white blood cells. Whole cells and sonicated preparations of oral F. nucleatum strains VPI No. 4355, 10197 and ATCC No. 10953 haemagglutinated human and sheep red blood cells. Sonicated preparations of the organisms were tested for HA activity before and after absorption with human cells. Buccal epithelial, gingival fibroblast and white blood cells bound the HA-active fragments, as observed by: (1) decrease in the HA activity of the sonicated preparation after absorption, (2) increase in HA activity of the cells used for absorption, (3) presence of microbial fragments on the cells after absorption detected by fluorescent antibody. The HA-active fragments were released from the cells by EDTA; furthermore, galactose but not glucose inhibited the attachment of F. nucleatum to human cells. The role of cell binding in colonization by the organisms and in immune-stimulated damage to host cells is important.
TI  - Gas-containing brain abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Gas-containing brain abscesses are rarely seen. Recently, in a 28-year-old man, such an abscess ruptured into the lateral ventricle but was treated successfully. Fusobacterium nucleatum, an anaerobic bacillus, was cultured from the pus obtained.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections.
AB  - Because of the rarity of anaerobic infections of the urinary tract and the difficulty of establishing these organisms as pathogens, anaerobic culture is not included as part of routine urine bacteriological examination. Pyuria was found during examination of a 41-year-old man with a chronic renal allograft rejection reaction. Aerobic urine cultures failed to yield any pathogens. Urine cytology demonstrated intracellular organisms that proved to be Fusobacterium nucleatum on anaerobic culture. The serotypically identical organism was isolated from a needle biopsy specimen of the renal allograft. In the presence of pyuria the finding of micro-organisms in the urine sediment that fail to grow on routine aerobic cultures should lead to examination for anaerobic bacterial infection of the urinary tract.
TI  - Polyclonal B-cell activation induced by extracts of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from periodontally diseased sites.
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine whether gram-negative bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites contained polyclonal B-cell activators. Polyclonal B-cell activation, which results in nonspecific activation of multiple B-cell clones was analyzed by a hemolysis-in-gel assay designed to detect a broad range of antibody specificities. Extracts from numerous bacterial strains, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas sputigena, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were tested. Extracts of the above organisms were found to stimulate polyclonal antibody responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, although the magnitude of stimulation varied among the extracts. Optimal antibody-forming cell responses were found at stimulator doses between 5 and 1,000 micrograms/ml. We conclude that the resident gram-negative subgingival flora associated with periodontal lesions possesses potent polyclonal B-cell activators. These activators may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing B lymphocytes to produce antibody, osteolytic factors, or both and possibly other mediators of inflammation.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in dentoalveolar infections.
AB  - The bacteriology of 57 dentoalveolar infections was studied using optimal techniques to collect, transport and process specimens. There was an average of 4 bacterial species per specimen, and only 1/3 of the specimens held aerobes. Among the aerobic bacteria, streptococci dominated and among the anaerobes the Gram-negative rods, Bacteroides ruminicola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were most frequently isolated followed by Gram-positive cocci, in particular Streptococcus intermedius. All aerobic isolates were resistant to penicillins but sensitive to clindamycin and tinidazole. The other anaerobic isolates were sensitive to penicillins but showed varying susceptibility to erythromycin and doxycycline. Tinidazole was effective against all anaerobic Gram-negative rods. The presence of volatile fatty acids in pus from dentoalveolar infections was found to be of presumptive value for the diagnosis of anaerobic infections. Direct gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of pus is recommended as a routine procedure for preliminary diagnosis of anaerobic dentoalveolar infections.
TI  - Enzymatic characterization of some oral and nonoral gram-negative bacteria with the API ZYM system.
AB  - The API ZYM system (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.), containing 19 chromogenic substrates, was utilized semiquantitatively to detect extracellular acid and alkaline phosphatases, aminopeptidases, proteases, esterase-lipase, phosphoamidase, and glycosidases in 128 oral and nonoral isolates of black-pigmented Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Wolinella recta, and Veillonella parvula. In the black-pigmented Bacteroides group of organisms, a strong trypsin reaction was present in Bacteroides gingivalis (oral species) but not in Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (nonoral species). Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, in contrast to Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, exhibited strong N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity. H. aphrophilus produced beta-galactosidase and alpha-glucosidase, but the closely related Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. Capnocytophaga was distinct with respect to strong aminopeptidase reactions. This study showed that a wide range of enzymes which have the potential of causing tissue injury and inflammation can be elaborated from major oral gram-negative species. Also, the API ZYM system appears to be a valuable adjunct to traditional biochemical testing in identifying oral gram-negative species.
TI  - Bacteriologic evaluation of the efficacy of mechanical root canal instrumentation in endodontic therapy.
AB  - The presence of bacteria in 17 single-rooted teeth, with periapical lesions, was  studied throughout a whole period of treatment. The root canals were irrigated with physiologic saline solution during instrumentation. No antibacterial solutions or dressings were used. Bacteria were found in all initial specimens from the teeth (median number of bacterial cells 4 x 10(5), range 10(2) - 10(7)) and the number of strains in the specimens ranged from 1 to 10.88% of the strains were anaerobic. The most commonly isolated species were: Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp intermedius and Eubacterium alactolyticum. Mechanical instrumentation reduced the number of bacteria considerably. Specimens taken at the beginning of each appointment usually contained 10(4) - 10(6) bacterial cells and at the end 10(2) - 10(3) fewer. Bacteria were eliminated from the root canals of eight teeth during the treatment. In seven root canals bacteria persisted despite treatment on five successive occasions. There was no evidence that specific microorganisms were implicated in these persistent infections. Teeth where the infection persisted despite being treated five times were those with a high number of bacteria in the initial sample.
TI  - Lysozyme digestion and chemical characterization of the peptidoglycan of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev 1.
AB  - The amino acids in the peptidoglycan of Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev 1 are D-glutamic acid, meso-lanthionine, and D- (42%) and L-alanine (58%). About 70% of the lanthionine residues were not susceptible to dinitrophenylation, evidently because they are involved in cross-linkages. Consequently, lysozyme digestion of the peptidoglycan yielded 20 to 25% uncross-linked disaccharide tri- and tetrapeptides. A chemical analysis of isolated glycopeptides indicated that the structure of the building block of this peptidoglycan is N-acetylgucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-glutamic acid-meso-lanthionine(-D-alanine). I present evidence which supports the classification of the F. nucleatum Fev 1 peptidoglycan as a new A1 delta, directly cross-linked, meso-lanthionine-containing peptidoglycan.

TI  - Comparison of Marion's anaerobic culture/set-A and the Baltimore Biological Laboratory Gaspak anaerobic system in the cultivation and recovery of bacteria from human dental plaque.
AB  - Marion's anerobic culture/set-A (Bio-Bag A) and the Baltimore Biological Laboratory (BBL) Gaspak anaerobic system were evaluated for their efficiency in the cultivation and recovery of anaerobes and capnophilic organisms from human dental plaque samples. Both culture systems were relatively efficient in supporting the growth of pure culture of various bacterial species recently isolated from the human dental plaques. When the dental plaque samples were cultured the organisms commonly found were cultivatable in both culture systems. However, the counts and proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum from the samples were significantly higher in Marion's culture system, whereas the proportions of black-pigmented Bacteroides sp. were significantly higher in the BBL anaerobic system.
TI  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli: Their role in infection and patterns of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. II. Little-known Fusobacterium species and miscellaneous genera.
AB  - Twenty infrequently reported species of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli other than Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and members of the genus Bacteroides were studied with regard to their role in infection and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In addition, the literature regarding the recovery of these organisms from both the normal flora and infections of humans was reviewed. During a six-year period at the Wadsworth Clinical Anaerobic Bacteriology Research Laboratory (Veterans Administration Wadsworth Medical Center, Los Angeles, Calif.), 39 (6%) of 679 specimens obtained from anaerobic infections yielded "other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli" (OGNAB). Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium russii were the most commonly isolated OGNAB. Most of the OGNAB tested were resistant to erythromycin, and most strains, except for F. varium, were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were active against all strains of OGNAB tested. Certain Fusobacterium species are undoubtedly previously unrecognized members of the normal flora of the oropharynx, upper respiratory tract, or urogenital tract and may be present in infections derived from these floras.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - The maintenance of B-cell and T-cell function in frozen and stored human lymphocytes.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify and test a convenient means for long-term storage of lymphocytes taken from clinically characterized patients without losing B- or T-cell function. Accordingly, peripheral blood lymphocytes were frozen and stored, and portions of each sample were subsequently assayed for T-cell blastogenic response and B-cell Jerne plaquing at various time intervals after freezing. A comparison of the cell counts of fresh and frozen cultures indicated that cell were recovered after freezing. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant differences in (i) cell viability; (ii) blastogenic response to antigens of Actinomyces maeslandii, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and tetanus toxoid; (iii) blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen; and (iv) polyclonal B-cell response to pokeweed mitogen as measured by the direct Jerne plaque assay. The retained blastogenic and plaquing responses seen in frozen cultures indicated the maintenance of both T-cell and B-cell function, respectively. This is the first reported demonstration of Jerne plaquing of normal human lymphocytes after freezing. It appears that freezing techniques provide a means for repeating and extending both T- and B-cell assays using frozen stored portions of the same cell samples.
TI  - Complement-dependent histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, induced by lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Veillonella parvula.
AB  - The capacity of phenol/water extracted lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Veillonella to induce histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells has been evaluated by means of a bioassay using atropinized guinea pig ileum and a fluorescence assay. Histamine release was found to be completely complement dependent. It was also found that LPS of Veillonella have the greatest capacity to induce histamine release and Bacteroides have the weakest.
TI  - Fatty acids of Fusobacterium species: taxonomic implications.
AB  - Fatty acids of Fusobacterium species were examined by gas-liquid chromatography.  Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. necrophorum, F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans and F. varium showed similar patterns, characterized by the presence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate, n-tetradecanoate, hexadecenoate, n-hexadeconoate, ocadecenoate, n-octadecanoate and a component having the properties of octadecadienoate. Fusobacterium nucleatum contained 3-hydroxyhexadecanoate as a distinctive character. Simpler fatty acid patterns characterized by the absence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate and other hydroxy fatty acids were observed in F. plauti, the single strain of F. prausnitzii and in the majority of strains classified as F. russii and F. naviforme. Neither methyl-branched nor cyclopropane fatty acids could be detected in any of the strains examined. In addition to fatty acid methyl esters, the chromatographic profiles of all species except F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans and F. naviforme contained substantial amounts of fatty aldehyde dimethyl acetals of chain lengths C14 to C18.
TI  - Filament formation of Fusobacterium nucleatum cells induced by mecillinam.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of mecillinam transformed Fusobacterium nucleatum cells into a marked filament form, quite different from a spherical form demonstrated in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Animal model for anaerobic lung abscess.
AB  - There are no satisfactory animal models for the study of anaerobic lung abscess.  Aspiration of food, gastric mucin, or hydrochloric acid, or any combination of these, along with oropharyngeal bacteria, is commonly believed to cause aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess. In the animal model described, none of the adjuvants was effective in producing anaerobic lung abscesses. Anaerobic bacteria derived from dental scrapings of a healthy adult (Peptococcus morbillorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium lentum, and Bacteroides fragilis), when inoculated transtracheally without any adjuvants into New Zealand male white rabbits, consistently produced lung abscesses. Neither B fragilis by itself nor a mixture of P. morbillorum, F. nucleatum, and E. lentum without the addition of B. fragilis produced lung abscesses. The bacterial isolates used in this study were stored in prereduced chopped-meat-glucose medium and subcultured several times and were found effective in reproducing anaerobic lung abscesses repeatedly. This animal model is suitable for the study of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of B. fragilis-associated anaerobic lung abscess.
TI  - The predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of beagle dogs with periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant cultivable dental plaque flora was studied in 10 adult female beagle dogs with advanced periodontitis. Supragingival and subgingival plaque from a maxillary third premolar (P3) was removed and cultured anaerobically on various growth media and all colonies were subcultured and partially characterized. Histopathological specimens of the plaque sampling sites showed significant loss of connective tissue attachment. Spirochetes were found in all samples. Anaerobic gram-negative organisms were predominant in both types of plaque accounting for about 55% of the cultivable organisms in the supragingival plaque and almost 75% in the subgingival plaque. Bacteroides asaccharolyticus was the most predominant organism in the supragingival plaque, whereas Fusobacterium nucleatum predominated in the subgingival flora. Streptococcal and actinomycotic species were common in the supragingival plaque, but their proportions, especially those of the actinomycetes, were decreased in the subgingival flora. In many respects the bacterial profile associated with disease resembled that reported in human periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with Streptococcus and Bacteroides.
AB  - Oral strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (HA) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of HA-active F. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. HA-active sonicated fragments (SF) prepared from F. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. Attachment of F. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the HA activity of the SF in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. HA activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of F. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment. Of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed F. nucleatum HA-active fragments. They included Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, Bacteroides corrodens, Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus sanguis (Blackburn and JC 74) and Streptococcus mutans AHT, BHT, 10449 and 6715. Chelators revealed that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a Ca2+-dependent interaction. Sugar inhibition demonstrated that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a D-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. A reduction in the absorption of F. nucleatum HA-active fragments by Strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.
TI  - Attachment of serum non-antibody glycoproteins to the Fusobacterium nucleatum found in periodontal disease.
AB  
TI  - Histological and histochemical study of the influence of lipopolysaccharide extracted from Fusobacterium nucleatum on the periapical tissues in the monkey Macaca fascicularis.
AB  
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Forty-two children with decubitus ulcers were studied using aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 (50%) of the patients, five times as the only isolates and 16 times mixed with aerobes. Aerobes only were present in 20 (48%) of the patients. There were a total of 83 isolates, 46 aerobes and 37 anaerobes, with an average of two species per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.9 anaerobes). The predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci (17), Bacteroides fragilis (6), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4). The most common aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (23), Group A beta hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus influenzae (5), and Enterobacter agglomerans (5). The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children is demonstrated.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Induction of Epstein-Barr virus antigens in human lymphoblastoid P3HR-1 cells with culture fluid of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus-associated early antigen and viral capsid antigen were efficiently induced in human lymphoblastoid P3HR-1 cells with culture fluid of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a member of the indigenous microbial flora of the human host. This finding may suggest a new approach to assess the possible role of the "cofactor(s)" in the etiology of Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases.
TI  - Surface vs core-tonsillar aerobic and anaerobic flora in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Specimens from both the surface and the core of tonsils from 23 children with recurrent tonsillitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium nucleatum, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Eubacterium sp. The predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Haemophilus sp. beta-Lactamase production was noted in 49 isolates from 19 patients (83%). Seventy percent of the aerobic isolates were recovered in both core and surface specimens, compared with 57% of the anaerobic isolates. Ten percent of aerobes were recovered only in the core, compared with 33% of the anaerobes, and 20% of the aerobes in the surface only, compared wtih 10% of the anaerobes. These data demonstrate the discrepancies between surface and core cultures in the isolation of anaerobic bacteria, and raise the question whether surface cultures can accurately predict the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms or other pathogens in the recurrently infected tonsil.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cervical adenitis in children.
AB  - Needle aspirates from 53 inflamed cervical lymph glands were studies for aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. Bacterial growth was achieved in 45 patients (85%). Sixty-six bacterial isolates were recovered, averaging 1.5 isolates per specimen (0.8 aerobes and 0.7 anaerobes), with as many as 4 isolates in some specimens. Aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 27 aspirates (60%) of the 45 culture-positive aspirates, anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 specimens (20%). Mycobacterium scrofulaceum was recovered in one (2%). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (14 isolates) and group A beta hemolytic streptococci (8). A total of 31 anaerobes were recovered, including gram-positive cocci (9, including 6 Peptococcus sp. and 3 Peptostreptococcus sp.), 8 Bacteroides sp. (including 3 B. melaninogenicus), 5 Propionibacterium acnes, and 4 Fusobacterium nucleatum. These data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Characterization of the adherence properties of Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The adherence and aggregation properties of 46 human oral Streptococcus salivarius isolates were examined. A total of 41% of the isolates aggregated with whole human saliva, 50% aggregated with human erythrocytes, and 85% adhered to human buccal epithelial cells. Strains that aggregated with saliva and erythrocytes usually reacted with Streptococcus group K typing serum whereas the non-hemagglutinating strains did not. K+ strains also adhered more strongly to human buccal epithelial cells than K- strains. All isolates coaggregated with Fusobacterium nucleatum LF and Bacteroides asaccharolyticus 2D, 91% coaggregated with Veillonella alcalescens V1, and 50% coaggregated with Veillonella parvula V4. S. salivarius HB aggregated with saliva from 15 different human donors and aggregated with human erythrocytes irrespective of the blood group. This strain only weakly aggregated with rat saliva or rat erythrocytes. We isolated mutants which concomitantly lost the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, aggregate with saliva, and bind to buccal epithelial cells, but retained their interbacterial aggregation properties. A second class of mutants lost the ability to coaggregate with Veillonella, but these mutants retained all of the other aggregation properties. Treatment of S. salivarius HB cells with pronase or subtilisin destroyed their ability to aggregate with saliva and erythrocytes and to bind to buccal epithelial cells. The unique characteristics of the aggregation and adherence reactions were suggested by differences in the rate of loss of activity during protease treatment and in the response to chemical modification. The presence of saliva did not affect hemagglutination and adherence to buccal epithelial cells. Binding of the salivary aggregating factor to the bacteria could be distinguished from aggregation on the basis that the latter required divalent cations. The factor involved in coaggregation with F. nucleatum LF was physicochemically different from the other factors, since it was resistant to heat and to extraction with trichloroacetic acid, aqueous phenol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and formamide, but was sensitive to proteases and was present in both classes of mutants. Coaggregation with V. alcalescens was not sensitive to proteases. A variety of mono- and disaccharides had no influence on any of the reactions tested.
TI  - Agglutination of human erythrocytes by Fusobacterium nucleatum: factors influencing hemagglutination and some characteristics of the agglutinin.
AB  - Various aspects of agglutination of human erythrocytes by fusobacterium nucleatum were examined. Titration experiments done in buffered saline at pH 6 to 10 showed the same agglutination endpoint. The presence of high concentrations of NaCl in reaction mixtures did not alter titers, but KCl in concentrations of 0.5 to 3.6 M increased titers twofold. The agglutinin was inactivated by heat, acid, alkali, 5% Formalin, and the proteolytic enzyme subtilopeptidase A and therefore appeared to be a protein. Treatment of bacterial cells with 2-mercaptoethanol had no effect. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments revealed that arginine and other compounds containing a guanido group as part of their structure were inhibitory at low concentrations. Various hexoses, some hexose derivatives, and most common metal ions, when added to bacterium-erythrocyte mixtures, had no effect. The binding of dansyl-L-arginine to bacteria, but not erythrocytes, was demonstrable by ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy.
TI  - Modulation of immunoreactivity to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms during pregnancy.
AB  - The lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. In addition, a group of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in response to the same stimulants. The stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides [Capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). Intrinsic (cells cultured in male AB plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. Additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. There was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. We propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.
TI  - Fatty acids and neutral sugars present in lipopolysaccharides isolated from Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from cells of Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. mortiferum, F. Gonidiaformans. varium and single strains of F. naviforme and F. russi were analysed for sugars and fatty acids. All preparations contained a monosaccharide tentatively identified as L-glycero-D-mannoheptose, but showed variation with respect to the presence of glucose, galactose, rhamnose and another heptose isomer, tentatively identified as L-glycero-D-mannoheptose. L-glycero-D-mannoheptose was a monosaccharide of great abundance in all LPS examined. 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonate and glucosamine were present in all LPS preparations. The fatty acids present were 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid as the main component, and n-tetradecanoic acid. Some LPS contained n-hexadecanoic acid. All the strains of F. nucleatum contained 3-hydroxy-hexadecanoic acid as a group-specific LPS constituent.
TI  - Immune response in rats against lipopolysaccharides of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides oralis administered in the root canal.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prepared from one strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum and one strain of Bacteroides oralis were examined for immunological responses in rats. The LPS were applied to the pulp chamber of the two mandibular incisors. Using the plaque forming cell (PFC) method both antigens showed a rapid IgM response in the spleen, and a slower one in the submandibular lymph nodes. In comparison with the IgM response, the IgG response was somewhat slower and weaker for LPS of Bacteroides, while for LPS of Fusobacterium it was hardly detectable. After about 3 weeks both antigens gave a significant antibody titer in serum. The results showed that locally applied antigens of oral microorganisms can stimulate to an immune response both in the lymph nodes and the spleen resulting in circulating antibodies. The nature of this response is dependent on the chemical characteristics of the LPS-antigen.
TI  - Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by anaerobic bacteria isolated from necrotic dental pulps.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria belonging to the species Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium alactolyticum, isolated from necrotic dental pulps, were tested for their capacity to induce neutrophil leukocyte chemotaxis. Generation of chemotactic factors in serum by whole bacterial cells and chemotaxis induced by bacterial extracts were studied in vitro by the Boyden technique. Subcutaneously implanted wound chambers in guinea pigs were used for testing leukocyte migration in vivo. All bacterial strains had a similar high capacity to induce neutrophil chemotaxis. The heavy accumulation of polymorhponuclear neutrophil leukocytes associated with clinical and experimental infections by B. melaninogenicus or B. asaccharolyticus cannot be ascribed to any extreme ability of these organisms to generate chemotactic factors.
TI  - Susceptibility of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Fusobacteria in Antibacterial agents.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 45 antimicrobial agents were established by the agar dilution method for 37 strains of Bacteroidaceae: Bacteroides fragilis (18 strains), B. thetaiotaomicron (8 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (6 strains), and Fusobacterium spp. (5 strains). The fusobacteria tested showed good susceptibility to beta-lactam-antibiotics, tetracyclines, lincomycins, and nitroimidazole compounds. Bacteria of the B. fragilis group were resistant to most of the penicillins and cephalosporins and could not be suppressed with certainty by nitroimidazoles and older tetracyclines. Doxycycline and minocycline, however, showed sufficient activity, and all our Bacteroides strains tested were sensitive to clindamycin. Especially the good in vitro susceptibility of all Bacteroidaceae strains investigated to cefoxitin may offer new therapeutic possibilities.
TI  - Medium for selective isolation of Fusobacterium nucleatum from human periodontal  pockets.
AB  - A selective medium, CVE agar, was developed for the isolation of Fusobacterium nucleatum from subgingival plaque of periodontally diseased patients. The medium contained 1.0% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems), 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% glucose, 0.02% L-tryptophan, 1.5% agar, and 5% defibrinated whole sheep blood. Erythromycin and crystal violet were added as the selective inhibitory agents at concentrations of 4 and 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The medium permitted almost total recovery of F. nucleatum when compared with a nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by 6 to 8 orders of magnitude. Microorganisms suppressed to a lesser degree included Selenomonas sputigena, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and some strains of Peptostreptococcus. The distinct colonial morphology of F. nucleatum on CVE agar made differentiation relatively easy when contaminants were present. With this medium, F. nucleatum was enumerated from 278 subgingival plaque samples and accounted for less than 1.0 to greater than 25% of the cultivatable microbiota.
TI  - Surface ultrastructure of some oral bacteria.
AB  - Adhesion of Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and an Actinomyces sp. to enamel and epon and their interspecies cohesion was studied with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. For adhesion studies enamel or epon was coated with salivary macromolecules and then cells of S. sanguis and in some experiments also with F. nucleatum or Actinomyces sp. Cells of S. sanguis were seen scattered over the surface of a thin "pellicle" that was heavily stained, and F. nucleatum and Actinomyces sp. adhered to S. sanguis or directly to the "pellicle". For studies of cohesion S. sanguis was brought to cohere with F. nucleatum or Actinomyces sp. and then processed for transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the cell surface structures involved was studied in negatively stained preparations or in thin sections of material treated with ruthenium red or poststained with uranyl and lead salts, phosphotungstic acid or periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium tetroxide. S. sanguis demonstrated a fuzzy coat of fimbriae that seemed to unfold in areas of contact with other cells, while cells of F. nucleatum had 6-10 polar pilus-like fimbriae, which appeared to be instrumental in cohesion, as did a dense coat of long, slender fimbriae that covered cells of Actinomyces sp.
TI  - O-antigenic cross-reactivity in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the same chemotype isolated from seven strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum were examined by indirect haemagglutination and inhibition of haemagglutination in unabsorbed and absorbed antisera. Four common major antigenic specificities were detected, and two of the LPS examined contained antigenic specificities not shared with any of the other LPS. In addition, a few weak cross-reactions were observed, also with some LPS of other chemotypes.
TI  - Human complement activation by lipopolysaccharides from bacteroides oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and veillonella parvula.
AB  - The properties of different lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations to induce C3 conversion in human serum was studied by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis. C3 conversion by the alternative pathway was evaluated after calcium depletion, and lipid A-dependent activation was measured by means of inhibition with polymyxin B sulfate. LPS from Bacteroides oralis converted Co mainly via the alternative pathway, whereas LPS from Fusobacterium nucleatum and Veillonella parvula const pronounced lipid A-dependent conversion. The results are discussed in relation to the chemical composition of the LPS preparations.
TI  - Bacterial colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia following tracheostomy and long-term intubation in pediatric patients.
AB  - Serial tracheal cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from 27 pediatric patients during one year of follow-up. The patients had required tracheostomy and prolonged intubation for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months (average, 7 1/2 months). Cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. The most frequent aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis. Replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. Tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia. The data suggest that anaerobic bacteria are a part of the bacterial flora in colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia in patients with tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.
TI  - A study of the bacteria associated with advancing periodontitis in man.
AB  - Samples of apical plaque were taken by means of an anaerobic gas-flushed syringe  from 21 sites in eight patients. The samples were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated and incubated in an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2 for 7-21 days. All colonies on plates containing 20-50 isolates were picked, repeatedly restreaked, characterized and identified where possible by a probabilistic computer identification program. The sites were divided into four groups on the basis of clinical features. The significance of differences between bacterial populations in the groups was determined by the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, while the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the rank correlation of clinical features of diseases and microbial species. The subgingival microbiota in advanced destructive sites was predominated by Gram-negative rods. The microbiota of two young adult patients with generalized extensive bone loss, extensive clinical inflammation and suppuration was dominated by Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and an organism with characteristics consistent with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The predominant cultivable microbiota in two patients with extensive bone loss but minimal clinical inflammation was predominated by Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss intermedius and Eikenella corrodens in one patient and E. corrodens and a slow growing fusiform-shaped Bacteroides in a second patient. A third group of four patients demonstrated moderate levels of clinical inflammation and evidence of continued bone loss in the last year. Predominant organisms in this group were more heterogeneous and included B. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, the "fusiform" Bacteroides and anaerobic vibrios. Sites with minimal disease in the patients revealed higher proportions of Gram-positive organisms including Rothia dentocariosa, Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus. A positive rank correlation could be detected between clinical inflammation including suppuration and B. asaccharolyticus and a negative rank correlation between inflammation and E. corrodens.
TI  - Demonstration of lanthionine as a natural constituent of the peptidoglycan of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Peptidoglycan was purified from the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum strain Fev 1, using boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate and pronase. The composition of this peptidoglycan was found to be similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria, except that it lacked diaminopimelic acid. Lanthionine, the monosulfur analog of diaminopimelic acid, was identified as the diaminodicarboxylic acid of this peptidoglycan. It is assumed that lanthionine replaced diaminopimelic acid. Thus, the peptidoglycan of F. nucleatum Fev 1 is one of the few known sources of naturally occurring lanthionine.
TI  - The effect of divalent cation chelators and magnesium on activation of the alternative complement pathway by Fusobacterium polymorphum (nucleatum).
AB  
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis caused by fusobacterium nucleatum: a case report.
AB  - A 58-year-old man with a history of chronic alcohol abuse presented with vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum. This case demonstrated the foul smelling abscess characteristic of anaerobic infection. Deep anaerobic infections are well known to be resistant to closed treatment, and the computerized tomographic scan confirmed the diagnosis of a paravertebral abscess in this case. An increased awareness among clinicians that anaerobic bacilli can cause oteomyelitis, together with more sophisticated culture techniques, will greatly aid the management of this virulent form of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. III. Physiological characterization.
AB  - Sixty-eight strains of capnophilic fusiform Gram-negative rods from the human oral cavity were subjected to extensive physiologic characterization, tested for susceptibility to various antibiotics, and the mol-percent guanine plus cytosine of each isolate determined. The characteristics of the isolates were compared with 10 fresh and 2 stock isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The isolates clearly differed from the Fusobacterium species on the basis of mol-percent guanine plus cytosine, end products, growth in a capnophilic environment and fermentation of carbohydrates. All of the gliding isolates required CO2 and formed acetate and succinate, but not H2S, indole or acetylmethylcarbinol. All fermented glucose, sucrose, maltose and mannose. The organisms may be differentiated on the basis of fermentation of additional carbohydrates, hydrolysis of polymers and reduction nitrate. Three species are proposed: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. Ten isolates did not fit into the proposed species.
TI  - The bacteriology of perimandibular space infections.
AB  - The bacteriology of 21 perimandibular clised-space infections was studied prospectively using optimal bacteriological techniques to collect, transport, and process specimens. There was an average of six microbial species per specimen, including approximately four anaerobes and two aerobes. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic and non-hemolytic streptococci; the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococci, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. These findings indicate that most perimandibular space infections involve a polymicrobial flora in which anaerobic bacteria are the dominant isolates. Antimicrobial decisions should account for these observations, particularly in cases where cultural data are not available or when anaerobic cultures are not performed with optimal techniques.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  - The survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. Fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. Clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. Peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and Streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. These diluents could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Clindamycin in treatment of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  - Twenty-eight patients with anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections were treated with clindamycin alone or clindamycin with gentamicin. Sixteen of the patients presented with pneumonitis, nine with necrotizing pneumonia, and three with lung abscesses. The average length of treatment was 13.8 days, and the duration of temperature after initiation of therapy was 3.1 days. The predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (23 isolates), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14), Bacteroides fragilis (9), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (11). The most frequent aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (12), Diplococcus pneumoniae (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (5), Staphylococcus aureus (9), and Escherichia coli (6). All patients responded to the therapy and were cured of the infection. There were no side effects observed from the administration of clindamycin. None of the patients developed any blood dyscrasia, liver damage, diarrhea, or colitis. Clindamycin appears to be effective in the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections in children, alone or with an aminoglycoside when indicated.
TI  - Immunochemical studies of partially hydrolyzed lipopolysaccharide from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev1 lipopolysaccharide was split by hydrolysis with 1% acetic acid into acid-soluble polysaccharide and lipid A. Gel filtration of the polysaccharide on Bio-Gel P-60 gave a high-molecular-weight fraction eluted with the void volume, and a fraction eluted at 2.4 x Vo. The high-molecular-weight fraction contained L-glycero-D-manno-heptose in relatively large amounts, glucose, glucosamine, an unknown amino compound and small amounts of (or no) D-glycero-D-manno-heptose. Phosphorus and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid were not detected. The other fraction contained L- and D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, glucose, glucosamine, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid and phosphorus. Further fractionation experiments and serological investigations indicated that the high-molecular-weight fraction carried the O-antigenic side chains, whereas the material eluted from Bio-Gel P-60 at 2.4 x Vo represented the core oligosaccharide.
TI  - Serologic reactions of oral gram negative anaerobic bacilli.
AB  - Serological reactions were performed using hyperimmune rabbit antisera and antigenic preparations of Leptotrichia buccalis, Fusobacterium fusiforme, and Fusobacterium polymorphum. All tests indicated that there was serologic cross reactivity between the two Fusobacterium species. No cross reactivity could be detected between the Fusobacterium species and L. buccalis. The findings suggest that F. fusiform and F. polymorphum are similar in their immunogenicity, and that the grouping of these two organisms as F. nucleatum may be justified.
TI  - A restriction enzyme from Fusobacterium nucleatum 4H which recognizes GCNGC.
AB  - A site-specific restriction endonuclease Fnu4H I isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum 4H recognizes the DNA nucleotide sequence 5'G C N G C-3'/3'-C G N C G-5' and cleaves as indicated by the arrows.
TI  - Site specific endonuclease from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Four different isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum (A,C,D and E) contain restriction endonucleases of differing specificity. Whilst many of the endonucleases are isochizomers of known enzymes, two novel activities are Fnu DII which recognizes and cleaves the sequence 5'-CGCT-3'/3'-GCGC-5' AND Fnu EI which recognizes and cleaves the sequence 5'-GATC-3'/3'-CTAG-5' irrespective of the extent of methylation of the adenine residues.
TI  - Haemagglutination inhibition and aggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum by human  salivary mucinous glycoproteins.
AB  
TI  - Ultrastructural localisation of lipopolysaccharide-binding sites with peroxidase-conjugated lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The localisation of lipopolysaccharide-binding sites on erythrocytes with peroxidase-coupled LPS is described. LPS was isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fus MC-8) by phenol-water extraction. The LPS was coupled to horseradish peroxidase by the two-step method of Avrameas and Ternynck (1971). The biological and serological activities of the conjugated LPS were compared with those of the native material. Peroxidase could be coupled to LPS without significant loss of endotoxic or serological activity. The LPS-peroxidase conjugate could be demonstrated on erythrocytes by light and electron microscopy.
TI  - Sugar inhibition of oral Fusobacterium nucleatum haemagglutination and cell binding.
AB  
TI  - Anaerobic pulmonary infections.
AB  - The main cause of anaerobic pulmonary infections is aspiration of saliva, upper airway secretions or gastric content. Predisposing conditions include prominent dental disease, chronic upper respiratory tract infections and reduced consciousness. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci are the most frequently encountered organisms. The clinical presentations are lung abscess, lung gangrene and empyema, which all tend to take a slow and indolent course. Preferred localization are dependent lung segments, most often on the right side. For bacteriological examination in these infections, only transtracheal aspirate and aspirate from the lung or pleural space are considered adequate. In 26 cases of empyema treated in our hospital during the last 3 years, adequate specimens had been taken in 19. Fifteen had been adequately examined, and anaerobes were cultured in 6. Among 29 abscesses treated during the same period, adequate specimens had been taken in only 14, and 11 had been properly examined. Seven specimens grew anaerobes on culture. In prospective studies of transtracheal aspirate in 15 chronic bronchitics without emphysema, anaerobes were not demonstrated. In 11 patients with bronchiectasis, anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 3. Finally, no anaerobic bacteria could be demonstrated in the transtracheal aspirate from 76 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Anaerobic, pulmonary infections do not represent an intriguing medical problem in our region. However, knowledge of these infections is necessary to secure adequacy in collection of specimens and in their bacteriological examination.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 HFU), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  - The susceptibility of more than 40 strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (Sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. The influences of density of the inoculum upon MICs was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. splanchnicus, B. oralis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium fusiforme (F. nucleatum), Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Clostridium perfringens, C. fallax, Propionibacterium acnes and several species of Peptococcaceae showed broth dilution MICs of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. Members of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of S. varius had a broth dilution MIC of 256 microgram/ml. With most strains, the agar dilution MICs were 2 similar to 4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution MICs. In pour plate-tests, the MICs were not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. With most anaerobes, the MBCs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the MICs. The results obtained indicated that, apart from S. varius, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including B. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
TI  - Microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. Samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. Gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. Peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. Bacteriodes ochraceus, other Bacteroides species, Selenomonas sputigena, and Campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. Haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and Veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. The data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. This might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
TI  - The bacteriology of cavitating pulmonary infections and empysema. Studies of transtracheal aspirates and pleural fluid.
AB  - A prospective study of bacteriology in 14 cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema is reported. Bacteriologic results were based on transtracheal aspirates or pleural fluid. Appropriate anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 11 patients (79%); they were the only pathogens isolated in 6 patients. The predominant species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Aerobic bacteria were present in 7 patients. The results indicate that anaerobes play a key role in most cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema, and that proper culture of adequat specimens will generally establish the bacteriological diagnosis.
TI  - [Lung abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum (author's transl)].
AB  - A patient with epilepsy, 45 years of age, developed a lung abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum which was successfully treated with intravenous lincomycin. Quantitative anaerobic cultures of washed sputum proved to be useful in detecting the causative organism.
TI  - Chemotypes of Fusobacterium nucleatum lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were isolated from 20 strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and examined by paper chromatography, gas liquid chromatography and colorimetric methods for the presence of neutral sugars, amino sugars and 2-keto-3-dexoxy-octonate (KDO). The LPS had in common glucosamine, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, glucose and KDO. The KDO content was low. Galatose, rhamnose and D-glycero-D-manno-heptose were found in some strains. Based on the sugar composition of the LPS, the F. nucleatum strains could be classified into six chemotypes.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic localization of lipopolysaccharides in the cell wall of Bacteroides oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been extracted and purified from two anaerobic gram-negative bacteria: Bacteroides oralis and tfusobacterium nucleatum. Chemical analysis of the preparations showed a great proportion of neutral sugars, mainly glucose, in LPS of B. oralis. In rabbits, LPS of B. oralis induced both immunoglobulin M and G antibodies in contrast to LPS of F. nucleatum, to which only immunoglobulin M antibodies were produced. An immunohistochemical method with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies was used to localize LPS antigens at the ultrastructural level. An electron-dense reaction product, representing an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens and specific rabbit immunoglobulin labeled with peroxidase, was surrounding the cell wall, whereas appropriate controls were negative. The findings of the present study show that LPS of Bacteroides are probably bound to a complex, including glucans, in the outer membrane of the cell wall. LPS of Fusobacterium resemble LPS of other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Compact liquid nitrogen storage system yielding high recoveries of gram-negative  anaerobes.
AB  - A simple and compact system suitable for the preservation of fragile gram negative anaerobes and other bacteria in liquid N2 has been developed. Polypropylene straws used as specimen containers can be used easily within glove bags of anaerobic chambers, and their small size greatly increases the number of cultures which can be stored. Ancillary equipment and methods developed are described. The overall system was tested, using Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas sputigena. Various basal suspending fluids and cryoprotective supplements were studied. With fast rates of freezing and thawing, survival recoveries of the test microorganisms ranged from 80 to 100 percent of the input colony-forming units in a complex medium broth base without cryoprotective agent addition, and they consistently were 100 percent when 0.4 mM polyvinylpyrrolidine was used. Overall, cryoprotection by polyvinyl pyrrolidine was superior to that from glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide, the latter yielding recoveries similar to or less than those obtained with no cryoprotectant additive. All microorganisms were recoverable after storage for 1 year.
TI  - The anticomplementary activity of lipopolysaccharide preparations and sonicates from a strain of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  
TI  - Lethality for mice and chick embryos, pyrogenicity in rabbits and ability to gelate lysate from amoebocytes of Limulus polyphemus by lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Veillonella.
AB  - Phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Veillonella, Fusobacterium  nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were lethal for mice and 11-days-old chick embryos, pyrogenic in rabbits, and gelated Limulus amoebocyte lysate. Mouse lethality was considerably enhanced by actinomycin-D. In all test systems the endotoxin activity of Veillonella and Fusocbacterium LPS was comparable to that of LPS from Salmonella enteritidis, which was included as a reference endotoxin. The endotoxicity of the Bacteroides LPS was very low. While nanograms of the Veillonella and Fusobacterium LPS killed the chick embryos and gelated the Limulus lysates, microgram amounts of the Bacteroides LPS were needed to give positive reaction in the same test systems. As much as 74 microgram of the most active B. fragilis LPS were required to give a typical biphasic fever response in rabbits. A significant correlation was found between all test results (r = 0.90-0.98, p less than 0.001).
TI  - Gliding motility and actinomycin D sensitivity of Fusobacterium nucleatum and other gram-negative rods.
AB  - Six strains of gram-negative anaerobic fusiform rods (Fusobacterium and Bacteroides spp.), isolated from deep subgingival locations in humans, were examined for (i) gliding motility in slide cultures, (iii) cell densities on nutrient agar surfaces, and (iii) sensitivity to actinomycin D. Known gliding (FBt) and nonmotile (NM) strains of Myxococcus xanthus served as controls for the gliding and cell density experiments. In the present study, three strains of gram-negative fusiforms from the oral cavity, identified as Fusobacterium nucleatum (1a and P-1) and Bacteroides sp. (P-14), demonstrated characteristics similar to the gliding control strain M. xanthus. The only gliding oral strain sensitive to actinomycin D was a Bacteroides sp. (P-14).
TI  - Hepatic necrobacillosis. Report of a case resembling metastatic tumor.
AB  - A 47-year-old man had multiple pyogenic liver abscesses from which the anaerobic  bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus were isolated. The clinical course, diagnostic evaluation, and appearance of the lesions at surgery suggested metastatic tumor. Histologically, the lesions consisted of necrotic liver tissue surrounded by zones of acute and chronic inflammation and fibrous connective tissue closely resembling the lesions of hepatic necrobacillosis attributable to F necrophorum. Treatment with high doses of penicillin was curative.
TI  - Endotoxic activities of lipopolysaccharides of microorganisms isolated from an infected root canal in Macaca cynomolgus.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prepared from a strain of Bacteroides oralis, a strain  of Fusobacterium necrophorum, and a strain of F. nucleatum, all isolated from an infected root canal in monkey (Macaca cynomolgus), were examined for endotoxic activities using primary skin reactions in rabbits and induction of leukocyte chemotaxis in rats. LPS of B. oralis showed considerably lower ability to cause skin inflammation than LPS of the fusobacteria. However, the leukotactic effect of the LPS preparations as determined by the wound chamber method in rats was approximately of the same proportion. In both tests the reactions were compared with those of commercial LPS of Salmonella typhi. This study shows that endotoxic LPS can be isolated from oral Gram-negative bacteria, which have infected the root canal. Therefore LPS may play a role in the development and maintenance of chronic inflammation of the periapical tissues.
TI  - Therapeutic evaluation of minocycline and tetracycline for mixed anaerobic infection in mice.
AB  - Minocycline has demonstrated greater in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria than its parent compound, tetracycline. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of the two drugs was tested against a mixed anaerobic infection in a mouse model. Fusobacterium necrophorum plus F. nucleatum injected intraperitoneally produced progressive intrahepatic and occasional extrahepatic abscesses, which were measured at autopsy. Three treatment regimens were tested, single daily doses of antibiotic being administered by oral gavage: four doses begun at 2 or 24 h after challenge and 14 doses begun 3 weeks after challenge when abscesses were well developed. Autopsy was not performed until several weeks after completion of treatment to assess long-term effects. Based on the number of mice without lesions, the median effective dose (ED(50)) in milligrams per kilogram per dose for minocycline was significantly lower than that for tetracycline with each regimen tested. With the 2-h (immediate therapy) regimen and the 24-h-delayed therapy regimen, minocycline was 30 and 6 times, respectively, more effective against hepatic abscesses than tetracycline on a weight basis. With each antibiotic, abscesses outside the liver were more resistant to therapy, although again minocycline was more effective. In the treatment of developed abscesses (3-week-delayed regimen), minocycline was effective (ED(50) <16 mg/kg), whereas tetracycline was ineffective (ED(50) >256 mg/kg). Minocycline has demonstrated greater therapeutic efficacy in vivo than tetracycline in this experimental infection, which is similar, in certain aspects, to human anaerobic infection. These data support further evaluation of the clinical usefulness of minocycline.
TI  - Inhibition of leukocyte migration by the agarose plate technique. Application to  antigen from Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Leukocyte migration inhibition by antigen from Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum was studied in man by means of the direct leukocyte migration agarose technique (LMAT). Antigens were prepared by prolonged ultrasonication and were added to the leukocyte cultures in the original as well as in the concentrated solutions. Significant inhibition of migration with a 10-fold concentrated solution of candida antigen was demonstrated in subjects showing apositive intracutaneous reaction to candida. With the fusobacterial antigen, inhibition of migration or stimulation of migration were demonstrated in subjects with slight peridontal inflammation. A 5-fold increase in the concentration of fusobacterial antigen resulted in increased stimulation of migration or inhibition of migration. Preincubation of the leukocytes with puromycin abolished both inhibition and stimulation of migration by candidal or fusobacterial antigen. The study confirms that it is important to study dose-related effects when applying the LMAT to test cell-mediated immunity. The study is in support of stimulation of migration being an immunologic reaction.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of bacteroidaceae to cefoxitin and cephalothin (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of the new cephamycin C derivatives cefoxitin against 102 clinical isolates of Bacteroidaceae (95 Bacteroides strains and 7 Fusobacterium-Sphaerophorus cultures) was determined by tube dilution and standardized agar diffusion tests and compared to that of cephalothin. Cefoxitin was more active than cephalothin against 56 Bacteroides fragilis strains, 19 Bacteroides thetaiota-omicron strains and two Bacteroides splanchnicus strains. The difference seemed less pronounced with five Bacteroides vulgatus and four Bacteroides variabilis cultures. Three Bacteroides melaninogenicus and six Bacteroides oralis strains displayed similar sensitivity to both cephalosporins. At concentrations of 32 microng/ml or less, cefoxitin inhibited 91% and cephalothin 33% of the Bacteroides strains. Two strains of Sphaerophorus varius were likewise much more sensitive to cefoxitin than to cephalothin (MIC values 8 micron8/ml of cefoxitin and 256 microng/ml of cephalothin). Three other Sphaerophorus strains (the species necrophorus and freundii/mortiferum) and two of Fusobacterium fusiforme (Fusobacterium nucleatum) strains were very similar in their susceptibility to both cephalosporins. Statistical analysis of the relationship between MIC and zone size diameter showed relatively high correlation coefficients for cefoxitin and cephalothin (r=-0.741 and r=-0.703 respectively).
TI  - Chemical structure of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharides from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The lipid A component of lipopolysaccharides from Fusobacterium nucleatum Fev 1 consists of beta-1',6-linked D-glucosamine disaccharides, which carry two phosphate groups: one in glycosidic and one in ester linkage. The amino groups of the glucosamine disaccharides are substituted by D-3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. The hydroxyl groups of the disaccharide backbone are acylated by tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and D-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acids. Part of the ester-bound D-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid is 3-O-substituted by tetradecanoic acid. Whereas a similar pattern of fatty acids was detected in lipopolysaccharides from two other F. nucleatum strains, the amide-bound fatty acid in F. varium and F. mortiferum was D-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. The chemical relationships of lipid A from Fusobacteria and other gram-negative bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Hemagglutinating activity of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Gingival isolates of oral Fusobacterium nucleatum strains (gram-negative anaerobic fusiform bacilli) have shown the characteristic ability to hemagglutinate a variety of erythrocytes (RBC) of human and animal origin. Other members of the genus tested (F. necrophorus, F. varium, and F. mortiferum) displayed little if any ability to hemagglutinate RBC. The hemagglutination (HA) activity could be observed in the F. nucleatum strains with the whole cells and in most instances with sonicated preparations of the organisms. The HA activity was observed in cell wall preparations of the organism and appeared dependent upon a heat-labile protein component of the cell wall. In decreasing order, the RBC that would hemagglutinate with the smallest concentration of HA preparations were rabbit, monkey, human, sheep, horse, and ox. No differences in HA activity of the preparations with cells from the various human blood types were noted. Absorption of the HA preparation of one strain with human cells removed HA moiety was bound to the cells via a Ca2+ binding site interaction since ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol-bis-N,N'-tetraacetic acid inhibited binding, and HA could be reestablished by the addition of Ca2+ but not Mg2+. Rabbit antisera to the F. nucleatum strains inhibited HA activity when tested with the HA preparation in the standard test, whereas anti-Leptotrichia buccalis sera or normal rabbit sera had no effect. A tanned-cell passive HA test with rabbit anti-F. nucleatum sera displayed reactivity between the homologous strains but little reactivity with the other Fusobacterium species tested.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microflora of advanced periodontitis.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms harbored in the base of deep periodontal pockets of eight patients aged 34-48 years was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. From a total of 475 isolates, 425 (89.5%) were obligate anaerobes, 356(74.9%) were Gram-negative, and 441(92.8%) were categorized as rods. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium nucleatum constituted the majority of the isolates in seven samples, but their mutual proportions differed considerably between the samples. One sample was dominated by Actinomyces species. Some periodontopathic potentials of the predominating Gram-negative rods are summarized.
TI  - [The antibacterial action on dental plaque of antibiotics used in dentistry. 2. In vitro experiments on Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus and Fusobacterium nucleatum (author's transl)].
AB  
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - Absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  - The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: Phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, Rh. viridis, Rhodospirillum tenue, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Vibrio metchnikovii, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid L-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. With the aid of authentic D-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-O-substitution or type of linkage, possess the D-configuration. 2-Hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the L-configuration.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
TI  - Rosamicin: in vitro activity against anaerobes and comparison with erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of rosamicin was determined against 231 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of erythromycin against the same strains. Rosamicin and erythromycin had similar activity against strains of Peptostreptococcus and gram-positive nonsporeforming bacilli. Rosamicin was somewhat more active against strains of Peptococcus, Clostridium, and gram-negative anaerobes. All strains of Bacteroides fragilis tested were inhibited by 4 mug of rosamicin or less per ml, whereas only 76% of them were inhibited by this concentration of erythromycin. Rosamicin was distinctly more active against Fusobacterium nucleatum. Because of its in vitro activity, further investigation of the pharmacology of this drug is warranted.
TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen exposures for intrahepatic abscesses produced in mice by nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen exposures were evaluated for treatment of progressive liver abscesses produced by intraperitoneal injection of combined cultures of Fusobacterium necrophorum plus either Bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis or Fusobacterium nucleatum in a mouse model. Infected control and hyperbaric oxygen-exposed mice were autopsied 5 or 6 weeks after inoculation of bacteria and were assigned numerical pathology scores according to the number and size of abscesses present. Seventeen daily 3-h exposures to 100% O(2) at 2 atmospheres absolute pressure begun either 1 day or 1 week after injection of bacteria significantly reduced the number and size of abscesses among mice infected with either mixture of anaerobic organisms. Abscesses due to mixed fusobacteria were often completely resolved. These data support the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for treatment of mixed anaerobic infection produced by Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species and suggest its further evaluation as a potential alternate or adjunct to present therapy for certain types of serious anaerobic infection.
TI  - Total viable count and differential count of vibrio (campylobacter) sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, selenomonas sputigena, bacteroides ochraceus and veillonella in the inflamed and non inflamed human gingival crevice.
AB  
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Two pathways of glutamate fermentation by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Two pathways are involved in the fermentation of glutamate to acetate, butyrate,  carbon dioxide, and ammonia-the methylaspartate and the hydroxyglutarate pathways which are used by Clostridium tetanomorphum and Peptococcus aerogenes, respectively. Although these pathways give rise to the same products, they are easily distinguished by different labeling patterns of the butyrate when [4-(14)C]glutamate is used as substrate. Schmidt degradation of the radioactive butyrate from C. tetanomorphum yielded equally labeled propionate and carbon dioxide, whereas nearly all the radioactivity of the butyrate from P. aerogenes was recovered in the corresponding propionate. This procedure was used as a test for the pathway of glutamate fermentation by 15 strains (9 species) of anaerobic bacteria. The labeling patterns of the butyrate indicate that glutamate is fermented via the methylaspartate pathway by C. tetani, C. cochlearium, and C. saccarobutyricum, and via the hydroxyglutarate pathway by Acidaminococcus fermentans, C. microsporum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and F. fusiformis. Enzymes specific for each pathway were assayed in crude extracts of the above organisms. 3-Methylaspartase was found only in clostridia which use the methylaspartate pathway, including Clostridium SB4 and C. sticklandii, which probably degrade glutamate to acetate and carbon dioxide by using a second amino acid as hydrogen acceptor. High levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase were found exclusively in organisms that use the hydroxyglutarate pathway. The data indicate that only two pathways are involved in the fermentation of glutamate by the bacteria analyzed. The methylaspartate pathway appears to be used only by species of Clostridium, whereas the hydroxyglutarate pathway is used by representatives of several genera.
TI  - Rifampin-blood-agar as a selective medium for the isolation of certain anaerobic  bacteria.
AB  - A selective medium which allows detection of relatively small numbers of Fusobacterium varium in fecal specimens is described. Blood-agar containing 50 mug of rifampin per ml inhibits the growth of many species of Bacteriodes and of F. fusi-forme/nucleatum but allows good growth of F. varium and most strains of F. mortiferum. Quantitative cultures of 11 fecal specimens were done on rifampin and other selective and nonselective media. F. varium was recovered in counts of 10(6) and 10(7) per gram from two specimens on rifampin only. A third specimen yielded 10(10)F. varium on several media, including rifampin. Some Eubacterium and Clostridium species also grew on rifampin, and these ordinarily were distinguished from the Fusobacterium by colony morphology. This medium is of value in fecal flora studies and should be useful with other kinds of specimens where mixtures of organisms are common.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
TI  - Effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  - In the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. Of the species tested, Bacteroides oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium difficile, a Neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. A group K streptococcus and B. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. Mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. A Peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. When this strain was combined with two Clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. This polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. No net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
