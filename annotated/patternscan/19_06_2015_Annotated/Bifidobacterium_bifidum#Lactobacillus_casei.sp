TI  == a novel lactobacillus casei lp1 producing 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a bifidogenic growth stimulator.
AB  == 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (dhna) is a bifidogenic growth stimulator (bgs) and could be a functional food ingredient since bifidobacteria are beneficial for human health. for that reason, lactic acid bacteria producing dhna have been screened. a lactic acid bacterium lp1 strain isolated from a natural cheese was confirmed to produce dhna, analyzed by a hplc method. the strain was identified as lactobacillus casei by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the cell-free supernatant of fermented whey produced by l. casei lp1 presented the bgs activity for three bifidobacterial strains such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  kctc 3127, bifidobacterium bifidum kctc 3202, and bifidobacterium breve kctc 3220 which were human-originated. to the best of our knowledge, a l. casei strain which can produce dhna was firstly identified in this study.

TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile diarrhoea (cdd) in older patients. methods: pubmed, embase, central, cinahl, and  web of science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to may 2014. only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces, streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older  patients (age >/=65 years) were included. risk ratios (rrs) for aad and cdd relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. results: six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. only one trial showed that bacillus  licheniformis was effective for preventing aad in older patients. however, there  was no preventive effect for aad and cdd with lactobacillus acidophilus (florajen), lactobacillus casei shirota, saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum (cultech strains), and mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus cul60, cul21, bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20 and b. lactis cul34. conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of aad and cdd in older patients. however, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. to confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.

TI  == perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. we evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (pns) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group s [lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)cfu, lactobacillus rhamnosus hs 111, 1 x 10(9) cfu, lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9)  cfu, bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)cfu, and fructooligosaccharides (fos) 100  mg]--or placebo-controls--group c, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. the incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group s (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group c (16  of 23 patients, 69.6%) (p = 0.00). duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group s (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group c; p = 0.01). noninfectious complications were less common in group s (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group c; p = 0.03). mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group s vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group c (p = 0.00). no deaths occurred in group s,  whereas 6 deaths occurred in group c (p = 0.02). perioperative administration of  synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for pns.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == microencapsulation of probiotics by calcium alginate-gelatinized starch with chitosan coating and evaluation of survival in simulated human gastro-intestinal  condition.
AB  == microencapsulation as one of the most modern methods has considerable effects on  probiotic survival. in this study lactobacillus casei (atcc 39392) and bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521) were encapsulated using calcium alginate-gelatinized starch, chitosan coating and inulin via emulsion technique,  and were incubated in simulated gastric juice (along with pepsin, ph=1.5) and simulated intestinal juice (along with pancreatin and bile salts, ph = 8) for 2 hours at 37 (o)c. the morphology and size of microcapsules were measured by scanning electron and optical microscopy. the results indicated that the survival of microencapsulated probiotic increased significantly in simulated gastro-intestinal condition (p < 0.05). chitosan coating played a significant role in the protection of probiotic bacteria in simulated gastro-intestinal condition and the diameter of the microcapsules increased with the addition of chitosan coating. in general, this study indicated that microencapsulation with alginate-gelatinized starch coated with chitosan could successfully and significantly protect probiotic bacteria against adverse condition of simulated human gastro-intestinal condition.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == reduction of the enniatins a, a(1), b, b(1) by an in vitro degradation employing  different strains of probiotic bacteria: identification of degradation products by lc-ms-lit.
AB  == the degradation of the fusarium mycotoxins ens by 9 bacterial strains characteristic of the gastrointestinal tract like bb. longum, bb. bifidum, bb. breve, bb. adolescentes, lb. rhamnosus, lb. casei-casei, s. termofilus, lb. ruminis, lb. casei and twenty two strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. the fermentations were carried out in the liquid medium of de man rogosa sharpe (mrs) under anaerobic conditions for bifidobacteria streptococcus and lactobacillus, and in potato dextrose broth (pdb) for saccharomyces strains, during 48 h. the degradation of the bioactive compounds ens was also studied in a food system composed by wheat flour naturally contaminated by ens through fermentation by a strain of fusarium tricinctum. the determination of the ens in  the fermentation mediums was performed using the technique of the liquid chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometry detector in tandem (lc-ms/ms), whereas the identification of the degradation products produced by microbial fermentation was carried out using the technique of the lc coupled to the linear  ion trap (lit). all the bacteria analyzed in this study showed a significant ens  reduction in vitro during the fermentation processes, with degradation data ranging from 5 to the 99%. in the food system, the ens degradation data evidenced ranged from 1.3 to 49.2%. also three ens degradation products were identified.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == is a multispecies probiotic mixture effective in constipation during pregnancy? 'a pilot study'.
AB  == background: constipation during pregnancy is a common problem. nowadays only few  effective interventions are published preventing or treating constipation during  pregnancy. however, their use is limited due to side-effects. this uncontrolled intervention study was performed to determine if a mixture of probiotics in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy is effective. methods: women aged >/=  18 years with functional constipation were included at the obstetrical outpatient clinic and midwife practices. patients received during four weeks a daily dose of ecologic(r)relief (bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, bifidobacterium longum w108, lactobacillus casei w79, lactobacillus plantarum w62 and lactobacillus rhamnosus w71 (total 4*10(9) cfu)). for all analyses, the non-parametric paired wilcoxon test was used. primary outcome measure was change  in defecation frequency. secondary outcome measures were stool consistency, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual manoeuvres to facilitate defecation, abdominal pain, adverse effects, presence of reflux episodes and intake of bisacodyl. results: 20 women were included. defecation frequency significantly increased from 3.1 at baseline to 6.7 in week  four (p < 0.01). compared to baseline, a significant decrease in 1) sensation of  anorectal obstruction from 90.0% to 45.0% (p < 0.01), 2) sensation of incomplete  evacuation from 90.0% to 40.0% (p < 0.01), 3) straining during defecation from 100% to 65% (p = 0.01), 4) episodes of abdominal pain from 60% to 20% (p = 0.01)  and 5) the presence of reflux episodes from 60% to 20% in week four (p = 0.01) was found. other secondary outcomes did not decrease significantly. no side effects were reported. conclusions: ecologic(r)relief is effective in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy. a randomised placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data.

TI  == effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: atopic dermatitis, a chronic recurrent disease, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. in the last 30 years, the prevalence of atopic  dermatitis has rapidly increased due to industrialization. therefore, there have  been attempts in recent years to find new ways of treating and preventing atopic  dermatitis. objective: in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a combination of bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus salivarius strains were evaluated in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. methods: forty pediatric patients (23 males and 17 females) aged 1~13 years were enrolled. one eligible individual who was approached declined to participate. the probiotic group was administered a probiotic complex containing b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, l. casei, and l. salivarius for 8 weeks. the placebo group, on the other hand, was administered skim milk powder and dextrose. all of the parameters including serum cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein), scoring atopic dermatitis (scorad) index, and total serum immunoglobulin e (ige) were measured in both the probiotic group and the placebo group at the end of 8 weeks. results: probiotic intervention in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients effectively reduced the scorad index and serum cytokines interleukin (il)-5, il-6, interferon (ifn)-gamma, and total serum ige levels, but did not reduce levels of serum cytokines il-2, il-4, il-10, ecp, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) compared to the placebo group. conclusion: our study found probiotics to be effective in reducing atopic dermatitis patients' scorad index, serum il-5, il-6, ifn-gamma, and total serum ige levels but not effective in reducing serum il-2, il-4, il-10, ecp, or tnf-alpha levels.

TI  == probiotic modulation of dendritic cells co-cultured with intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate cytokine production and cell surface phenotypes of dendritic  cells (dc) in the presence of epithelial cells stimulated by probiotics. methods: mouse dc were cultured alone or together with mouse epithelial cell monolayers in normal or inverted systems and were stimulated with heat-killed probiotic bacteria, bifidobacterium lactis ad011 (bl), bifidobacterium bifidum bgn4 (bb), lactobacillus casei ibs041 (lc), and lactobacillus acidophilus ad031 (la), for 12 h. cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and phenotypic analysis of dc was investigated by flow cytometry. results: bb and lc in single-cultured dc increased the expression of i-ad, cd86 and cd40 (i-ad, 18.51 vs 30.88, 46.11; cd86, 62.74 vs 92.7, 104.12; cd40, 0.67 vs 6.39, 3.37, p < 0.05). all of the experimental probiotics increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (il)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha. however, in the normal co-culture systems, lc and la decreased the expression of i-a(d) (39.46 vs 30.32, 33.26, p < 0.05), and none of the experimental probiotics increased the levels of il-6 or tnf-alpha. in the inverted co-culture systems, lc decreased the expression of cd40 (1.36 vs -2.27,  p < 0.05), and all of the experimental probiotics decreased the levels of il-6. in addition, bl increased the production of il-10 (103.8 vs 166.0, p < 0.05) and  lc and la increased transforming growth factor-beta secretion (235.9 vs 618.9, 607.6, p < 0.05). conclusion: these results suggest that specific probiotic strains exert differential immune modulation mediated by the interaction of dendritic cells and epithelial cells in the homeostasis of gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

AB  == mouse paneth cell alpha-defensins, termed cryptdins, are secreted into the intestinal lumen, have microbicidal activity, and contribute to intestinal innate immunity. among them, cryptdin-4 (crp4) has the most potent microbicidal activity. in the intestinal lumen, commensal bacteria colonize and elicit beneficial effects in the host. however, the effects of crp4 against commensal bacteria are poorly understood. thus, we investigated the bactericidal activities of crp4 against commensal bacteria compared to noncommensal bacteria. oxidized crp4 showed only minimal or no bactericidal activity against 8 out of 12 commensal bacterial species, including bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus  casei. we further addressed a role of the conserved disulfide bonds of crp4 by analyzing reduced crp4 (r-crp4). r-crp4 demonstrated significantly greater bactericidal activities against 7 of 12 commensal bacteria than did oxidized crp4. oxidized crp4 and r-crp4 elicited equivalently potent bactericidal activities against 11 of the 11 noncommensal bacteria tested, such as salmonella  enterica serovar typhimurium,and against 5 of 12 commensal bacteria. furthermore, when r-crp4 was exposed to a processing enzyme of cryptdins, i.e. mmp-7, r-crp4 was degraded and the bactericidal activities disappeared. these findings suggest  that crp4 has selective bactericidal activities against intestinal microbiota and that the activities are dependent on the disulfide bonds.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == fermentation of metroxylon sagu resistant starch type iii by lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == the in vitro fermentability of sago (metroxylon sagu) resistant starch type iii (rs(3)) by selected probiotic bacteria was investigated. sago rs(3) with 12% rs content was prepared by enzymatic debranching of native sago starch with pullulanase enzyme, followed by autoclaving, cooling, and annealing. the fermentation of sago rs(3) by l. acidophilus ftcc 0291, l. bulgaricus ftcc 0411,  l. casei ftcc 0442, and b. bifidum bb12 was investigated by observing the bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption profiles, ph changes, and total short  chain fatty acids (scfa) produced in the fermentation media. comparisons were made with commercial fructo-oligosaccharide (fos), hi-maize 1043, and hi-maize 240. submerged fermentations were conducted in 30 ml glass vials for 24 h at 37 degrees c in an oven without shaking. the results indicated that fermentation of  sago rs(3) significantly (p < 0.05) yielded the highest count of lactobacillus sp. accompanied by the largest reduction in ph of the medium. sago rs(3) was significantly the most consumed substrate compared to fos and hi-maizes.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (dfm) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with  feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. fifteen mature thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 latin square design balanced for carryover effects. within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (ls; 1.2 g of starch x kg  of bw(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (hs; 2.4 g of starch.kg of bw(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. the dfm treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of bw x d) as follows: no dfm (con; control), lactobacillus acidophilus (lac1; single-species dfm), or a mixture of l. acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum, and enterococcus faecium (lac4; multiple-species dfm). total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (ls; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (ac; abrupt change  in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (hs; high dietary starch collection). data collected consisted of total  dm intake and fecal output, fecal ph, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of dfm in the feed. with the exception of fe digestibility, there were no starch x dfm interactions. there was an effect of starch level (p <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for mg (p = 0.08) and cp, k, and zn (p > 0.10). horses supplemented with lac4 had increased ether extract (p < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased na (p < 0.10) digestibilities compared with con horses. all dfm-supplemented horses had increased cu (p < 0.05) and fe and numerically increased zn digestibilities compared with con horses. fecal ph decreased (p < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (p < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from ls to hs. there was a tendency for elevated fecal ph (p < 0.10) in lac1 horses compared with con horses. these results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet  can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated  with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. the potential response of dfm supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.

TI  == design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  == background & aims: although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the  final design of the probiotic. specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. methods: from a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a  simulated gastrointestinal environment. functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. results: specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.  based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (ecologic 641); bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis. combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of il-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. conclusions: application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in mrs broth and buffalo milk.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: eight dairy bacteria tolerant to la were grown in mrs  broth containing la (200 microg ml(-1)) and cla was assessed. seven bacteria were able to form cla after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between  17% and 36%. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest la conversion and were  inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of la. the production of cla at 200 microg ml(-1) of la was two- or threefold in milk than mrs broth. all evaluated strains were able to produce cla from high la levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). conclusions: the most tolerant strain to la was lact. casei. lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of cla at high la concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). the selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. low concentration of la must be added to the medium to enhance cla formation. significance and impact of the study: the production of cla by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.

TI  == [modulation of gastrointestinal physiology through probiotic strains of lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium bifidum].
AB  == the products called functional foods, which besides being merely nutritional have different beneficial effects on the organism, are situated in the context of diet and health promotion. amongst these functional foods we can distinguish, amongst  others, between probiotic and prebiotic compounds. the micro-organisms most widely used in probiotic foods belong to the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium types. in this article we have studied the effect of diets supplemented with lactobacillus casei or bifidobacterium bifidum on animal development and especially on the intestinal function, centred on their immune, digestive and absorptive activity in growing animals. the bacteria strains used modify the activity of the small intestine of healthy mice, significantly affecting their enzymatic activity (sucrase, maltase and aminopeptidase) and the collection of nutrients (galactose and glycilsarcosine), as well as the intestinal immune activity (higher number of peyer's patches). however, these effects do not appear to disturb the development of the growing animals since no significant differences are appreciated in their body weight or in their blood parameters. these results make clear the possible beneficial effects on intestinal physiology and contribute to the understanding of the possible mechanisms of action of the probiotics, which could be employed in the preventive treatment of different pathologies related to the digestive apparatus.

AB  == this study investigated whether orally administered probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus casei) and a gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli) function as allergic immune modulators to prevent food allergy, according to the hygiene hypothesis. c3h/hej mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (ova) and cholera toxin for 5 weeks. after sensitization, the ova-induced mice that were not treated with bacteria had significantly increased  levels of ova-specific ige, total ige, and igg1 in sera, as well as scab-covered  tails. in comparison, groups treated with b. bifidum bgn4 (bgn4), l. casei 911 (l. casei), or escherichia coli mc4100 (e. coli) had decreased levels of ova-specific ige, total ige, and igg1, and decreased levels of mast cell degranulation and tail scabs. ova-specific iga levels were decreased in bgn4- and l. casei-treated groups. in conclusion, administration of e. coli, bgn4, or l. casei decreased the ova-induced allergy response. however, a normal increase in body weight was inhibited in the e. coli-treated mice and in the montreated mice  groups during allergy sensitization. thus, bgn4 and l. casei appear to be useful  probiotic bacteria for the prevention of allergy.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and  first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower  content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus  strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

AB  == in this study, the effects of orally administered viable lactobacillus casei shirota strain yit9029 on the immunity parameters of wistar and brown norway rats were examined. for this purpose, we used the trichinella spiralis host resistance model. two weeks before and during t. spiralis infection, rats were fed 10(9) viable l. casei bacteria 5 days per week. the t. spiralis-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) response was significantly enhanced in both wistar and brown norway rats given l. casei. in both rat strains fed l. casei, serum t. spiralis-specific immunoglobulin g2b (igg2b) concentrations were also significantly increased. in the model, no significant effects of l. casei on larval counts or inflammatory reactions in the tongue musculature, body weights,  or lymphoid organ weights were observed. serum specific antibody responses, other than igg2b, were not changed by feeding of l. casei. in contrast to l. casei, it  was shown that orally administered bifidobacterium breve or bifidobacterium bifidum had no influence on the measured infection and immunity indices in the rat infection model. since the rat dth response is considered to be a manifestation of th1 cell-mediated immunity and the igg2b isotype has been associated with th1 activity, it was concluded that th1 cells could play an active role in the immunomodulatory effects of orally administered l. casei. furthermore, our data do not indicate that the effect of oral supplementation with l. casei is dependent on the genetic background of the host.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  == we reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with  the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering  of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. the most widely studied probiotic bacteria were lactobacillus gg (22 studies), lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and  enterococcus faecium (7 studies). intake of lactobacillus gg consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. however, evidence for the prevention by lactobacillus gg and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. cholesterol lowering by l. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by e. faecium seems to be transient. two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. the production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. in conclusion, consumption of foods containing lactobacillus gg may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

TI  == the effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, lb. casei 20094, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, streptococcus thermophilus ts2, pediococcus pentosaceus pe39 and bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. the rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by mg2+, while the effect of k+ and na+ differed from strain to strain.  the beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. the types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in  each case, but the rates of their production differed. all the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.

TI  == in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  == in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the  ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the  serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.

TI  == inability of lactobacillus casei strain gg, l. acidophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidum to degrade intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria have been suggested for use in the prevention of relapse of ulcerative colitis and of recurrent pouchitis. these strains may not damage the protective intestinal mucus glycoproteins. methods: lactobacillus casei strain gg and strains isolated from a commercial fermented product (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and a mesophylic lactic culture) were cultured in vitro on hog gastric mucin and human intestinal glycoproteins. furthermore, germ-free rats were mono-associated with lactobacillus gg and poly-associated with the other strains. glycoproteins were isolated from rat distal ileum, cecum, and colon. mucus degradation was established by assaying carbohydrates (hexosamines, hexoses, pentoses), proteins, and blood group antigenicity. results: all strains colonized the intestinal mucus but were not found in the deep crypts. degradation of mucus glycoproteins was observed neither in vitro nor in vivo. conclusion: the tested strains do not break down intestinal mucus glycoproteins and thus far are safe to use for therapy.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
