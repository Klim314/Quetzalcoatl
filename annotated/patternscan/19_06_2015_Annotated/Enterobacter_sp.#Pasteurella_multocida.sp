TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  == in vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. a microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). the following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: staphylococcus aureus, s intermedius, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent agglomerans, ent cloacae, escherichia coli, actinobacillus sp, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, rhodococcus equi, proteus  vulgaris, and bordetella bronchiseptica. isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included s aureus, s intermedius, ent aerogenes, ent agglomerans, pasteurella multocida, b bronchiseptica, pr mirabilis, and serratia  sp.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
