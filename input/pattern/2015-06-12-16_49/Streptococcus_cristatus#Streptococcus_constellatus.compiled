TI  - Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov., isolated from a foot abscess of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).
AB  - A facultative anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive-staining, coccus-shaped bacterium was isolated from an abscess on the right foot of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The colonies were beta-haemolytic. Catalase and oxidase activities were negative. The Lancefield group B antigen was expressed. On the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics, the bacterium was tentatively identified as a streptococcal species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacterium shared 96.7 %, 96.4 %, 96.1 %, 95.8 % and 95.7 % sequence similarities with Streptococcus gordonii, S. cristatus, S. intermedius, S. anginosus and S. constellatus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and housekeeping genes encoding D-alanine : D-alanine ligase (ddl), the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (sodA) revealed that the bacterium represented a novel species closely related to, albeit different from, S. gordonii, S. cristatus and the anginosus streptococci. The name Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is M09-11185(T) ( = ATCC BAA-2337(T) = KCTC 33006(T)).
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
