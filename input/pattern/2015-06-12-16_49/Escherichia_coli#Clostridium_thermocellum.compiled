TI  - Cofactor specificity of the bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhE) in wild-type and mutants of Clostridium thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum are thermophilic bacteria that have been engineered to produce ethanol from the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of biomass respectively. Although engineered strains of T. saccharolyticum produce ethanol with a yield of 90% of the theoretical maximum, engineered strains of C. thermocellum produce ethanol at lower yields ( approximately 50% of theoretical maximum). In the course of engineering these strains, a number of mutations have been discovered in their adhE genes, which encode both alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes. To understand the effect of these mutations, the adhE genes from six strains of C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, followed by purification by affinity chromatography and enzyme activity measurement. In wild type strains of both organisms, NADH was the preferred cofactor for both ALDH and ADH activity. In high ethanol-producing ("ethanologen") strains of T. saccharolyticum, both ALDH and ADH activities showed increased NADPH-linked activity. Interestingly, the ethanologenic strain of C. thermocellum, AdhE has acquired high NADPH-linked ADH activity while maintaining NADH-linked ALDH and ADH activity at wild-type levels. When single amino acid mutations in AdhE, that caused increased NADPH-linked ADH activity, were introduced into C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum, ethanol production increased in both organisms. Structural analysis was performed for the wild-type and mutant AdhE proteins to provide explanations for the cofactor specificity change on a molecular level. IMPORTANCE: This work describes the characterization of the AdhE enzyme from different strains of C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum. C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum are thermophilic anaerobes that have been engineered to make high yields of ethanol and can solubilize components of plant biomass and ferment the sugars to ethanol. In the course of engineering these strains, several mutations arose in the bifunctional alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase AdhE, changing both enzyme activity and cofactor specificity. We show that changing AdhE cofactor specificity from mostly NADH-linked to mostly NADPH-linked resulted in higher ethanol production in C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum.
TI  - Gene knockout identification using an extension of Bees Hill Flux Balance Analysis.
AB  - Microbial strain optimisation for the overproduction of a desired phenotype has been a popular topic in recent years. Gene knockout is a genetic engineering technique that can modify the metabolism of microbial cells to obtain desirable phenotypes. Optimisation algorithms have been developed to identify the effects of gene knockout. However, the complexities of metabolic networks have made the process of identifying the effects of genetic modification on desirable phenotypes challenging. Furthermore, a vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to a combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene knockout. The computational time increases exponentially as the size of the problem increases. This work reports an extension of Bees Hill Flux Balance Analysis (BHFBA) to identify optimal gene knockouts to maximise the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. This proposed method functions by integrating OptKnock into BHFBA for validating the results automatically. The results show that the extension of BHFBA is suitable, reliable, and applicable in predicting gene knockout. Through several experiments conducted on Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium thermocellum as model organisms, extension of BHFBA has shown better performance in terms of computational time, stability, growth rate, and production yield of desired phenotypes.
TI  - Analysis of strand-specific RNA-seq data using machine learning reveals the structures of transcription units in Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Identification of transcription units (TUs) encoded in a bacterial genome is essential to elucidation of transcriptional regulation of the organism. To gain a detailed understanding of the dynamically composed TU structures, we have used four strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) datasets collected under two experimental conditions to derive the genomic TU organization of Clostridium thermocellum using a machine-learning approach. Our method accurately predicted the genomic boundaries of individual TUs based on two sets of parameters measuring the RNA-seq expression patterns across the genome: expression-level continuity and variance. A total of 2590 distinct TUs are predicted based on the four RNA-seq datasets. Among the predicted TUs, 44% have multiple genes. We assessed our prediction method on an independent set of RNA-seq data with longer reads. The evaluation confirmed the high quality of the predicted TUs. Functional enrichment analyses on a selected subset of the predicted TUs revealed interesting biology. To demonstrate the generality of the prediction method, we have also applied the method to RNA-seq data collected on Escherichia coli and achieved high prediction accuracies. The TU prediction program named SeqTU is publicly available at https://code.google.com/p/seqtu/. We expect that the predicted TUs can serve as the baseline information for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in C. thermocellum and other bacteria.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of the family 54 carbohydrate-binding module from laminarinase (beta-1,3-glucanase) Lic16A of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) from laminarinase Lic16A of the hyperthermophilic anaerobic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum (ctCBM54) are reported. Recombinant ctCBM54 was prepared using an Escherichia coli/pQE30 overexpression system and was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belonged to space group P6322, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 130.15, c = 131.05 A. The three-dimensional structure of ctCBM54 will provide valuable information about the structure-function relation of the laminarinase Lic16A and will allow the exploitation of this binding module in biotechnological applications.
TI  - Structure, activity, and stability of metagenome-derived glycoside hydrolase family 9 endoglucanase with an N-terminal Ig-like domain.
AB  - A metagenome-derived glycoside hydrolase family 9 enzyme with an N-terminal immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain, leaf-branch compost (LC)-CelG, was characterized and its crystal structure was determined. LC-CelG did not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl cellobioside but hydrolyzed CM-cellulose, indicating that it is endoglucanase. LC-CelG exhibited the highest activity at 70 degrees C and >80% of the maximal activity at a broad pH range of 5-9. Its denaturation temperature was 81.4 degrees C, indicating that LC-CelG is a thermostable enzyme. The structure of LC-CelG resembles those of CelD from Clostridium thermocellum (CtCelD), Cel9A from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AaCel9A), and cellobiohydrolase CbhA from C. thermocellum (CtCbhA), which show relatively low (29-31%) amino acid sequence identities to LC-CelG. Three acidic active site residues are conserved as Asp194, Asp197, and Glu558 in LC-CelG. Ten of the thirteen residues that form the substrate binding pocket of AaCel9A are conserved in LC-CelG. Removal of the Ig-like domain reduced the activity and stability of LC-CelG by 100-fold and 6.3 degrees C, respectively. Removal of the Gln40- and Asp99-mediated interactions between the Ig-like and catalytic domains destabilized LC-CelG by 5.0 degrees C without significantly affecting its activity. These results suggest that the Ig-like domain contributes to the stabilization of LC-CelG mainly due to the Gln40- and Asp99-mediated interactions. Because the LC-CelG derivative lacking the Ig-like domain accumulated in Escherichia coli cells mostly in an insoluble form and this derivative accumulated in a soluble form exhibited very weak activity, the Ig-like domain may be required to make the conformation of the active site functional and prevent aggregation of the catalytic domain.
TI  - Differential Bees Flux Balance Analysis with OptKnock for in silico microbial strains optimization.
AB  - Microbial strains optimization for the overproduction of desired phenotype has been a popular topic in recent years. The strains can be optimized through several techniques in the field of genetic engineering. Gene knockout is a genetic engineering technique that can engineer the metabolism of microbial cells with the objective to obtain desirable phenotypes. However, the complexities of the metabolic networks have made the process to identify the effects of genetic modification on the desirable phenotypes challenging. Furthermore, a vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to the combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene deletion strategy. Basically, the size of a genome-scale metabolic model is usually large. As the size of the problem increases, the computation time increases exponentially. In this paper, we propose Differential Bees Flux Balance Analysis (DBFBA) with OptKnock to identify optimal gene knockout strategies for maximizing the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. This proposed method functions by improving the performance of a hybrid of Bees Algorithm and Flux Balance Analysis (BAFBA) by hybridizing Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm into neighborhood searching strategy of BAFBA. In addition, DBFBA is integrated with OptKnock to validate the results for improving the reliability the work. Through several experiments conducted on Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium thermocellum as the model organisms, DBFBA has shown a better performance in terms of computational time, stability, growth rate, and production yield of desired phenotypes compared to the methods used in previous works.
TI  - Construction of GH16 beta-glucanase mini-cellulosomes to improve the nutritive value of barley-based diets for broilers.
AB  - Anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria organize a comprehensive range of cellulases and  hemicellulases in high molecular weight multienzyme complexes termed cellulosomes. Integration of cellulosomal components occurs via highly ordered protein-protein interactions between cohesins and dockerins. This paper reports the production of mini-cellulosomes containing one (GH16-1C) or three (GH16-3C) copies of Clostridium thermocellum glucanase 16A (CtGlc16A). Barley beta-1,3-1,4-glucans are known to be antinutritive for monogastric animals, particularly for poultry. GH16-1C and GH16-3C were used to supplement barley-based diets for broilers. The data revealed that the two mini-cellulosomes effectively improved the nutritive value of barley-based diets for broilers. Analysis of mini-cellulosome molecular integrity revealed that linker sequences separating protein domains in scaffoldins and cellulosomal catalytic units are highly susceptible to proteolytic attack in vivo. The data suggest that linker protection could result in further improvements in enzyme efficacy to improve the nutritive value of barley-based diets for monogastric animals.
TI  - Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of a thermophilic beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - beta-1,3-1,4-Glucanases catalyze the specific hydrolysis of internal beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds adjacent to the 3-O-substituted glucose residues in mixed-linked beta-glucans. The thermophilic glycoside hydrolase CtGlu16A from Clostridium thermocellum exhibits superior thermal profiles, high specific activity and broad pH adaptability. Here, the catalytic domain of CtGlu16A was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in the trigonal space group P3121, with unit-cell parameters a=b=74.5, c=182.9 A, by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to 1.95 A resolution. The crystal contains two protein molecules in an asymmetric unit. Further structural determination and refinement are in progress.
TI  - Engineered platform for bioethylene production by a cyanobacterium expressing a chimeric complex of plant enzymes.
AB  - Ethylene is an industrially important compound, but more sustainable production methods are desirable. Since cellulosomes increase the ability of cellulolytic enzymes by physically linking the relevant enzymes via dockerin-cohesin interactions, in this study, we genetically engineered a chimeric cellulosome-like complex of two ethylene-generating enzymes from tomato using cohesin-dockerins from the bacteria Clostridium thermocellum and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus. This complex was transformed into Escherichia coli to analyze kinetic parameters and enzyme complex formation and into the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which was then grown with and without 0.1 mM isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. Only at minimal protein expression levels (without IPTG), the chimeric complex produced 3.7 times more ethylene in vivo than did uncomplexed enzymes. Thus, cyanobacteria can be used to sustainably generate ethylene, and the synthetic enzyme complex greatly enhanced production efficiency. Artificial synthetic enzyme complexes hold great promise for improving the production efficiency of other industrial compounds.
TI  - CBD binding domain fused gamma-lactamase from Sulfolobus solfataricus is an efficient catalyst for (-) gamma-lactam production.
AB  - BACKGROUND: gamma-lactamase is used for the resolution of gamma-lactam which is utilized in the synthesizing of abacavir and peramivir. In some cases, enzymatic method is the most utilized method because of its high efficiency and productivity. The cellulose binding domain (CBD) of cellulose is often used as the bio-specific affinity matrix for enzyme immobilization. Cellulose is cheap and it has excellent chemical and physical properties. Meanwhile, binding between cellulose and CBD is tight and the desorption rarely happened. RESULTS: We prepared two fusion constructs of the gamma-lactamase gene gla, which was from Sulfolobus solfataricus P2. These two constructs had Cbd (cellulose binding domain from Clostridium thermocellum) fused at amino or carboxyl terminus of the gamma-lactamase. These two constructs were heterogeneously expressed in E. coli rosetta (DE3) as two fusion proteins. Both of them were immobilized well on Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose matrix). The apparent kinetic parameters revealed that carboxyl terminus fused protein (Gla-linker-Cbd) was a better catalyst. The V(max) and k(cat) value of Avicel immobilized Gla-linker-Cbd were 381 U mg(-)(1) and 4.7 x 10(5) s(-)(1) respectively. And the values of the free Gla-linker-Cbd were 151 U mg(-)(1) and 1.8 x 10(5) s(-)(1) respectively. These data indicated that the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme was upgraded after immobilization. The immobilized Gla-linker-Cbd had a 10-degree temperature optimum dropping from 80 degrees C to 70 degrees C but it was stable when incubated at 60 degrees C for 48 h. It remained stable in catalyzing 20-batch reactions. After optimization, the immobilized enzyme concentration in transformation was set as 200 mg/mL. We found out that there was inhibition that occurred to the immobilized enzyme when substrate concentration exceeded 60 mM. Finally a 10 mL-volume transformation was conducted, in which 0.6 M substrate was hydrolyzed and the resolution was completed within 9 h with a 99.5% ee value. CONCLUSIONS: Cellulose is the most abundant and renewable material on the Earth. The absorption between Cbd domain and cellulose is a bio-green process. The cellulose immobilized fusion Gla exhibited good catalytic characters, therefore we think the cellulose immobilized Gla is a promising catalyst for the industrial preparation of (-) - gamma-lactam.
TI  - Potent and specific inhibition of glycosidases by small artificial binding proteins (affitins).
AB  - Glycosidases are associated with various human diseases. The development of efficient and specific inhibitors may provide powerful tools to modulate their activity. However, achieving high selectivity is a major challenge given that glycosidases with different functions can have similar enzymatic mechanisms and active-site architectures. As an alternative approach to small-chemical compounds, proteinaceous inhibitors might provide a better specificity by involving a larger surface area of interaction. We report here the design and characterization of proteinaceous inhibitors that specifically target endoglycosidases representative of the two major mechanistic classes; retaining and inverting glycosidases. These inhibitors consist of artificial affinity proteins, Affitins, selected against the thermophilic CelD from Clostridium thermocellum and lysozyme from hen egg. They were obtained from libraries of Sac7d variants, which involve either the randomization of a surface or the randomization of a surface and an artificially-extended loop. Glycosidase binders exhibited affinities in the nanomolar range with no cross-recognition, with efficient inhibition of lysozyme (Ki = 45 nM) and CelD (Ki = 95 and 111 nM), high expression yields in Escherichia coli, solubility, and thermal stabilities up to 81.1 degrees C. The crystal structures of glycosidase-Affitin complexes validate our library designs. We observed that Affitins prevented substrate access by two modes of binding; covering or penetrating the catalytic site via the extended loop. In addition, Affitins formed salt-bridges with residues essential for enzymatic activity. These results lead us to propose the use of Affitins as versatile selective glycosidase inhibitors and, potentially, as enzymatic inhibitors in general.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of a novel alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (CtGH43) from Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405.
AB  - The truncated carbohydrate-active enzyme belonging to family 43 glycoside hydrolase from Clostridium thermocellum (CtGH43) is an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase that in combination with endoxylanase leads to complete breakdown of L-arabinosyl-substituted xylans. The recombinant enzyme CtGH43 from C. thermocellum was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography. The recombinant CtGH43 has a molecular mass of 35.86 kDa. Preliminary structural characterization was carried out on CtGH43 crystallized from different conditions, which gave either cube-shaped or brick-shaped crystals. These diffracted to a resolution of 1.65 A for the cubic form and 1.1 A for the monoclinic form. Molecular replacement was used to solve the CtGH43 structure.
TI  - Bioethanol production from hemicellulose rich Populus nigra involving recombinant hemicellulases from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Bioethanol was produced from poplar leafy biomass rich in hemicelluloses content  involving recombinant Clostridium thermocellum hemicellulases and pentose sugar utilizing Candida shehatae. FT-IR analysis revealed effective AFEX pretreatment of poplar leaves. Repetitive batch strategy yielded approximately 1.5-fold rise in cell biomass and specific activity of both, acetylxylanesterase (Axe) and GH43 hemicellulase. TLC and HPAEC exhibited xylose and arabinose release from hydrolyzed biomass. SSF trial with 1% (wv(-1)) pretreated poplar and mixed enzymes showed approximately 1.5-fold higher ethanol titre as compared with SHF. The shake flask SSF with 5% (wv(-1)) pretreated poplar furnished 4.56 and 5.43gL(-1) ethanol with Axe and mixed enzymes, respectively. Whereas, bioreactor scale-up exhibited approximately 1.25-fold increase in ethanol titres (5.68, 6.75gL(-1)) as compared with shake flask with an yield of 0.295 (gg(-1)) and 0.351 (gg(-1)), respectively with Axe and mixed enzymes.
TI  - optGpSampler: an improved tool for uniformly sampling the solution-space of genome-scale metabolic networks.
AB  - Constraint-based models of metabolic networks are typically underdetermined, because they contain more reactions than metabolites. Therefore the solutions to this system do not consist of unique flux rates for each reaction, but rather a space of possible flux rates. By uniformly sampling this space, an estimated probability distribution for each reaction's flux in the network can be obtained. However, sampling a high dimensional network is time-consuming. Furthermore, the constraints imposed on the network give rise to an irregularly shaped solution space. Therefore more tailored, efficient sampling methods are needed. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm (called optGpSampler), which implements the Artificial Centering Hit-and-Run algorithm in a different manner than the sampling algorithm implemented in the COBRA Toolbox for metabolic network analysis, here called gpSampler. Results of extensive experiments on different genome-scale metabolic networks show that optGpSampler is up to 40 times faster than gpSampler. Application of existing convergence diagnostics on small network reconstructions indicate that optGpSampler converges roughly ten times faster than gpSampler towards similar sampling distributions. For networks of higher dimension (i.e. containing more than 500 reactions), we observed significantly better convergence of optGpSampler and a large deviation between the samples generated by the two algorithms. AVAILABILITY: optGpSampler for Matlab and Python is available for non-commercial use at: http://cs.ru.nl/~wmegchel/optGpSampler/.
TI  - Fine-structural variance of family 3 carbohydrate-binding modules as extracellular biomass-sensing components of Clostridium thermocellum anti-sigmaI factors.
AB  - The anaerobic, thermophilic, cellulosome-producing bacterium Clostridium thermocellum relies on a variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes in order to efficiently break down complex carbohydrates into utilizable simple sugars. The regulation mechanism of the cellulosomal genes was unknown until recently, when genomic analysis revealed a set of putative operons in C. thermocellum that encode sigmaI factors (i.e. alternative sigma factors that control specialized regulon activation) and their cognate anti-sigmaI factor (RsgI). These putative anti-sigmaI-factor proteins have modules that are believed to be carbohydrate sensors. Three of these modules were crystallized and their three-dimensional structures were solved. The structures show a high overall degree of sequence and structural similarity to the cellulosomal family 3 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM3s). The structures of the three carbohydrate sensors (RsgI-CBM3s) and a reference CBM3 are compared in the context of the structural determinants for the specificity of cellulose and complex carbohydrate binding. Fine structural variations among the RsgI-CBM3s appear to result in alternative substrate preferences for each of the sensors.
TI  - Functional and structural characterization of family 6 carbohydrate-binding module (CtCBM6A) of Clostridium thermocellum alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase.
AB  - The gene encoding the family 6 carbohydrate-binding module (CtCBM6A) from Clostridium thermocellum, cloned in pET-21a(+) expression vector, was overexpressed using Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) cells and purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant CtCBM6A showed molecular size of approximately 15 kDa. Ligand-binding analysis of CtCBM6A with rye arabinoxylan and oat spelt xylan by affinity gel electrophoresis showed low affinity for these ligands (Ka of 40 and 26 liter/g, respectively), and analysis by fluorescence spectroscopy (Ka of 33 and 15 liter/g, respectively) corroborated lower binding affinity with the above soluble ligands. However, CtCBM6A displayed significantly higher ligand-binding affinity with insoluble wheat arabinoxylan with equilibrium association constant Ka of 230 M(-1) and binding capacity (N0) of 11 micromole/g. The protein melting curve of CtCBM6A displayed a peak shift from 53 to 58 degrees C in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that Ca2+ imparts thermal stability to the CtCBM6A structure. Homology modeling of CtCBM6A revealed a characteristic beta-sandwich core structure. The Ramachandran plot of CtCBM6A showed 89% of the residues in the most favorable region, 10% in additionally favored region, and 1% in generously allowed region, indicating that CtCBM6A has a stable conformation.
TI  - Deciphering ligand specificity of a Clostridium thermocellum family 35 carbohydrate binding module (CtCBM35) for gluco- and galacto- substituted mannans and its calcium induced stability.
AB  - This study investigated the role of CBM35 from Clostridium thermocellum (CtCBM35) in polysaccharide recognition. CtCBM35 was cloned into pET28a (+) vector with an engineered His6 tag and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. A homogenous 15 kDa protein was purified by immobilized metal ion chromatography (IMAC). Ligand binding analysis of CtCBM35 was carried out by affinity electrophoresis using various soluble ligands. CtCBM35 showed a manno-configured ligand specific binding displaying significant association with konjac glucomannan (Ka = 14.3x10(4) M(-1)), carob galactomannan (Ka = 12.4x10(4) M(-1)) and negligible association (Ka = 12 microM(-1)) with insoluble mannan. Binding of CtCBM35 with polysaccharides which was calcium dependent exhibited two fold higher association in presence of 10 mM Ca(2+) ion with konjac glucomannan (Ka = 41x10(4) M(-1)) and carob galactomannan (Ka = 30x10(4) M(-1)). The polysaccharide binding was further investigated by fluorescence spectrophotometric studies. On binding with carob galactomannan and konjac glucomannan the conformation of CtCBM35 changed significantly with regular 21 nm peak shifts towards lower quantum yield. The degree of association (K a) with konjac glucomannan and carob galactomannan, 14.3x10(4) M(-1) and 11.4x10(4) M(-1), respectively, corroborated the findings from affinity electrophoresis. The association of CtCBM35with konjac glucomannan led to higher free energy of binding (DeltaG) -25 kJ mole(-1) as compared to carob galactomannan (DeltaG) -22 kJ mole(-1). On binding CtCBM35 with konjac glucomannan and carob galactomannan the hydrodynamic radius (RH) as analysed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) study, increased to 8 nm and 6 nm, respectively, from 4.25 nm in absence of ligand. The presence of 10 mM Ca(2+) ions imparted stiffer orientation of CtCBM35 particles with increased RH of 4.52 nm. Due to such stiffer orientation CtCBM35 became more thermostable and its melting temperature was shifted to 70 degrees C from initial 50 degrees C.
TI  - Overexpression, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of glucuronoxylan xylanohydrolase (Xyn30A) from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The modular carbohydrate-active enzyme belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 30 (GH30) from Clostridium thermocellum (CtXynGH30) is a cellulosomal protein which plays an important role in plant cell-wall degradation. The full-length CtXynGH30 contains an N-terminal catalytic module (Xyn30A) followed by a family 6 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM6) and a dockerin at the C-terminus. The recombinant protein has a molecular mass of 45 kDa. Preliminary structural characterization was carried out on Xyn30A crystallized in different conditions. All tested crystals belonged to space group P1 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement has been used to solve the Xyn30A structure.
TI  - Structure of Acidothermus cellulolyticus family 74 glycoside hydrolase at 1.82 A  resolution.
AB  - Here, a 1.82 A resolution X-ray structure of a glycoside hydrolase family 74 (GH74) enzyme from Acidothermus cellulolyticus is reported. The resulting structure was refined to an R factor of 0.150 and an Rfree of 0.196. Structural analysis shows that five related structures have been reported with a secondary-structure similarity of between 75 and 89%. The five similar structures were all either Clostridium thermocellum or Geotrichum sp. M128 GH74 xyloglucanases. Structural analysis indicates that the A. cellulolyticus GH74 enzyme is an endoxyloglucanase, as it lacks a characteristic loop that blocks one end of the active site in exoxyloglucanases. Superimposition with the C. thermocellum GH74 shows that Asp451 and Asp38 are the catalytic residues.
TI  - Thermostable recombinant beta-(1-->4)-mannanase from C. thermocellum: biochemical characterization and manno-oligosaccharides production.
AB  - Functional attributes of a thermostable beta-(1-->4)-mannanase were investigated  from Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. Its sequence comparison the exhibited highest similarity with Man26B of C. thermocellum F1. The full length CtManf and truncated CtManT were cloned in the pET28a(+) vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, exhibiting 53 kDa and 38 kDa proteins, respectively. On the basis of the substrate specificity and hydrolyzed product profile, CtManf and CtManT were classified as beta-(1-->4)-mannanase. A 1.5 fold higher activity of both enzymes was observed by Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) salts. Plausible mannanase activity of CtManf was revealed by the classical hydrolysis pattern of carob galactomannan and the release of manno-oligosaccharides. Notably highest protein concentrations of CtManf and CtManT were achieved in tryptone yeast extract (TY) medium, as compared with other defined media. Both CtManf and CtManT displayed stability at 60 and 50 degrees C, respectively, and Ca(2+) ions imparted higher thermostability, resisting their melting up to 100 degrees C.
TI  - Continuous live cell imaging of cellulose attachment by microbes under anaerobic  and thermophilic conditions using confocal microscopy.
AB  - Live cell imaging methods provide important insights into the dynamics of cellular processes that cannot be derived easily from population-averaged datasets. In the bioenergy field, much research is focused on fermentation of cellulosic biomass by thermophilic microbes to produce biofuels; however, little effort is dedicated to the development of imaging tools to monitor this dynamic biological process. This is, in part, due to the experimental challenges of imaging cells under both anaerobic and thermophilic conditions. Here an imaging system is described that integrates confocal microscopy, a flow cell device, and a lipophilic dye to visualize cells. Solutions to technical obstacles regarding suitable fluorescent markers, photodamage during imaging, and maintenance of environmental conditions during imaging are presented. This system was utilized to observe cellulose colonization by Clostridium thermocellum under anaerobic conditions at 60 degrees C. This method enables live cell imaging of bacterial growth under anaerobic and thermophilic conditions and should be widely applicable to visualizing different cell types or processes in real time.
TI  - The nature of the carbohydrate binding module determines the catalytic efficiency of xylanase Z of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Xylanase Z of Clostridium thermocellum exists as a complex in the cellulosome with N-terminus feruloyl esterase, a carbohydrate binding module (CBM6) and a dockerin domain. To study the role of the binding modules on the activity of XynZ, different variants with the CBM6 attached to the catalytic domain at its C-terminal (XynZ-CB) and N-terminal (XynZ-BC), and the CBM22 attached at N-terminus (XynZ-B'C) were expressed in Escherichia coli at levels around 30% of the total cell proteins. The activities of XynZ-BC, XynZ-CB and XynZ-B'C were 4200, 4180 and 20,700U muM(-1) against birchwood xylan, respectively. Substrate binding studies showed that in case of XynZ-BC and XynZ-CB the substrate birchwood xylan remaining unbound were 51 and 52%, respectively, whereas in the case of XynZ-B'C the substrate remaining unbound was 39% under the assay conditions used. The molecular docking studies showed that the binding site of CBM22 in XynZ-B'C is more exposed and thus available for substrate binding as compared to the tunnel shape binding pocket produced in XynZ-BC and thus hindering the substrate binding. The substrate binding data for the two constructs are in agreement with this explanation.
TI  - Lignocellulosic fermentation of wild grass employing recombinant hydrolytic enzymes and fermentative microbes with effective bioethanol recovery.
AB  - Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) studies of steam exploded and alkali pretreated different leafy biomass were accomplished by recombinant Clostridium thermocellum hydrolytic enzymes and fermentative microbes for bioethanol production. The recombinant C. thermocellum GH5 cellulase and GH43 hemicellulase genes expressed in Escherichia coli cells were grown in repetitive batch mode, with the aim of enhancing the cell biomass production and enzyme activity. In batch mode, the cell biomass (A(600 nm)) of E. coli cells and enzyme activities of GH5 cellulase and GH43 hemicellulase were 1.4 and 1.6 with 2.8 and 2.2 U.mg(-)(1), which were augmented to 2.8 and 2.9 with 5.6 and 3.8 U.mg(-)(1) in repetitive batch mode, respectively. Steam exploded wild grass (Achnatherum hymenoides) provided the best ethanol titres as compared to other biomasses. Mixed enzyme (GH5 cellulase, GH43 hemicellulase) mixed culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida shehatae) system gave 2-fold higher ethanol titre than single enzyme (GH5 cellulase) single culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) system employing 1% (w/v) pretreated substrate. 5% (w/v) substrate gave 11.2 g.L(-)(1) of ethanol at shake flask level which on scaling up to 2 L bioreactor resulted in 23 g.L(-)(1) ethanol. 91.6% (v/v) ethanol was recovered by rotary evaporator with 21.2% purification efficiency.
TI  - A useful method integrating production and immobilization of recombinant cellulase.
AB  - The development of cellulase-based bioprocess is afflicted by the processing efficiency of enzymes. To address this issue, a method based on artificial oil bodies (AOBs) was proposed to integrate production and immobilization of recombinant cellulase. First, the heterologous endoglucanase (celA), cellobiohydrolase (celK), and beta-glucosidase (gls) genes were individually fused with oleosin, a structural protein of plant seed oils. After expression in Escherichia coli, each fusion protein of insolubility was mixed together with plant oils. AOBs were assembled by subjecting the mixture to sonication. Consequently, active CelA, CelK, and Gls were resumed and co-immobilized on AOBs surface. Finally, the assembly condition (including the protein ratio) and the reaction condition were further optimized by response surface methodology. The resulting AOBs-bound cellulase remained stable for 4 cycles of cellulose-hydrolyzed reactions. Overall, the result shows a promise of this proposed approach for processing recombinant cellulase, which may provide a facile method to investigate optimum combination of cellulase components towards various cellulosic materials.
TI  - A novel alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase of family 43 glycoside hydrolase (Ct43Araf) from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The study describes a comparative analysis of biochemical, structural and functional properties of two recombinant derivatives from Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 belonging to family 43 glycoside hydrolase. The family 43 glycoside hydrolase encoding alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (Ct43Araf) displayed an N-terminal catalytic module CtGH43 (903 bp) followed by two carbohydrate binding modules CtCBM6A (405 bp) and CtCBM6B (402 bp) towards the C-terminal. Ct43Araf and its truncated derivative CtGH43 were cloned in pET-vectors, expressed in Escherichia coli and functionally characterized. The recombinant proteins displayed molecular sizes of 63 kDa (Ct43Araf) and 34 kDa (CtGH43) on SDS-PAGE analysis. Ct43Araf and CtGH43 showed optimal enzyme activities at pH 5.7 and 5.4 and the optimal temperature for both was 50 degrees C. Ct43Araf and CtGH43 showed maximum activity with rye arabinoxylan 4.7 Umg(-1) and 5.0 Umg(-1), respectively, which increased by more than 2-fold in presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) salts. This indicated that the presence of CBMs (CtCBM6A and CtCBM6B) did not have any effect on the enzyme activity. The thin layer chromatography and high pressure anion exchange chromatography analysis of Ct43Araf hydrolysed arabinoxylans (rye and wheat) and oat spelt xylan confirmed the release of L-arabinose. This is the first report of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from C. thermocellum having the capacity to degrade both p-nitrophenol-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenol-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside. The protein melting curves of Ct43Araf and CtGH43 demonstrated that CtGH43 and CBMs melt independently. The presence of Ca(2+) ions imparted thermal stability to both the enzymes. The circular dichroism analysis of CtGH43 showed 48% beta-sheets, 49% random coils but only 3% alpha-helices.
TI  - A hybrid of bees algorithm and flux balance analysis with OptKnock as a platform  for in silico optimization of microbial strains.
AB  - Microbial strain optimization focuses on improving technological properties of the strain of microorganisms. However, the complexities of the metabolic networks, which lead to data ambiguity, often cause genetic modification on the desirable phenotypes difficult to predict. Furthermore, vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism lead to the combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene deletion strategy. Consequently, the computation time increases exponentially with the increase in the size of the problem. Hence, we propose an extension of a hybrid of Bees Algorithm and Flux Balance Analysis (BAFBA) by integrating OptKnock into BAFBA to validate the result. This paper presents a number of computational experiments to test on the performance and capability of BAFBA. Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium thermocellum are the model organisms in this paper. Also included is the identification of potential reactions to improve the production of succinic acid, lactic acid and ethanol, plus the discussion on the changes in the flux distribution of the predicted mutants. BAFBA shows potential in suggesting the non-intuitive gene knockout strategies and a low variability among the several runs. The results show that BAFBA is suitable, reliable and applicable in predicting optimal gene knockout strategy.
TI  - A targetron system for gene targeting in thermophiles and its application in Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Targetrons are gene targeting vectors derived from mobile group II introns. They consist of an autocatalytic intron RNA (a "ribozyme") and an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase, which use their combined activities to achieve highly efficient site-specific DNA integration with readily programmable DNA target specificity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used a mobile group II intron from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus to construct a thermotargetron for gene targeting in thermophiles. After determining its DNA targeting rules by intron mobility assays in Escherichia coli at elevated temperatures, we used this thermotargetron in Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophile employed in biofuels production, to disrupt six different chromosomal genes (cipA, hfat, hyd, ldh, pta, and pyrF). High integration efficiencies (67-100% without selection) were achieved, enabling detection of disruptants by colony PCR screening of a small number of transformants. Because the thermotargetron functions at high temperatures that promote DNA melting, it can recognize DNA target sequences almost entirely by base pairing of the intron RNA with less contribution from the intron-encoded protein than for mesophilic targetrons. This feature increases the number of potential targetron-insertion sites, while only moderately decreasing DNA target specificity. Phenotypic analysis showed that thermotargetron disruption of the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; Clo1313_1160) and phosphotransacetylase (pta; Clo1313_1185) increased ethanol production in C. thermocellum by decreasing carbon flux toward lactate and acetate. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Thermotargetron provides a new, rapid method for gene targeting and genetic engineering of C. thermocellum, an industrially important microbe, and should be readily adaptable for gene targeting in other thermophiles.
TI  - Functional display of complex cellulosomes on the yeast surface via adaptive assembly.
AB  - A new adaptive strategy was developed for the ex vivo assembly of a functional tetravalent designer cellulosome on the yeast cell surface. The design is based on the use of (1) a surface-bound anchoring scaffoldin composed of two divergent cohesin domains, (2) two dockerin-tagged adaptor scaffoldins to amplify the number of enzyme loading sites based on the specific dockerin-cohesin interaction with the anchoring scaffoldin, and (3) two dockerin-tagged enzymatic subunits (the endoglucanse Gt and the beta-glucosidase Bglf) for cellulose hydrolysis. Cells displaying the tetravalent cellulosome on the surface exhibited a 4.2-fold enhancement in the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) compared with free enzymes. More importantly, cells displaying the tetravalent celluosome also exhibited an ~2-fold increase in ethanol production compared with cells displaying a divalent cellulosome using a similar enzyme loading. These results clearly indicate the more crucial role of enzyme proximity than just simply increasing the enzyme loading on the overall cellulosomal synergy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that exploits the natural adaptive assembly strategy in creating artificial cellulosome structures. The unique feature of the anchoring and the adaptor scaffoldin strategy to amplify the number of enzymatic subunits can be easily extended to more complex cellulosomal structures to achieve an even higher level of enzyme synergy.
TI  - Cell-free protein synthesis and substrate specificity of full-length endoglucanase CelJ (Cel9D-Cel44A), the largest multi-enzyme subunit of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - Endoglucanase CelJ (Cel9D-Cel44A) is the largest multi-enzyme subunit of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome and is composed of glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 9 and 44 (GH9 and GH44) and carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) families 30 and 44 (CBM30 and CBM44). The study of CelJ has been hampered by the inability to isolate full-length CelJ from recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Here, full-length CelJ and its N- and C-terminal segments, CBM30-GH9 (Cel9D) and GH44-CBM44 (Cel44A), were synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system and then were purified to homogeneity. Analysis of the substrate specificities of CelJ and its derivatives demonstrated that the fusion of Cel9D and Cel44A results in threefold synergy for the degradation of xyloglucan, one of the major structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls. Because CelJ displayed broad substrate specificity including significant carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and xylanase activities in addition to high xyloglucanase activity, CelJ may play an important role in the degradation of plant cell walls, which are composed of highly heterogeneous polysaccharides. Furthermore, because Cel9D, but not Cel44A, acts as a semi-processive endoglucanase, the different modes of action between Cel9D and Cel44A may be responsible for the observed synergistic effect on the activity of CelJ (Cel9D-Cel44A).
TI  - Effects of synthetic cohesin-containing scaffold protein architecture on binding  dockerin-enzyme fusions on the surface of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbial synthesis of fuels, commodity chemicals, and bioactive  compounds necessitates the assemblage of multiple enzyme activities to carry out sequential chemical reactions, often via substrate channeling by means of multi-domain or multi-enzyme complexes. Engineering the controlled incorporation of enzymes in recombinant protein complexes is therefore of interest. The cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum is an extracellular enzyme complex that efficiently hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose. Enzymes interact with protein scaffolds via type 1 dockerin/cohesin interactions, while scaffolds in turn bind surface anchor proteins by means of type 2 dockerin/cohesin interactions, which demonstrate a different binding specificity than their type 1 counterparts. Recombinant chimeric scaffold proteins containing cohesins of different specificity allow binding of multiple enzymes to specific sites within an engineered complex. RESULTS: We report the successful display of engineered chimeric scaffold proteins containing both type 1 and type 2 cohesins on the surface of Lactococcus lactis cells. The chimeric scaffold proteins were able to form complexes with the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase fused to either type 1 or type 2 dockerin, and differences in binding efficiencies were correlated with scaffold architecture. We used E. coli beta-galactosidase, also fused to type 1 or type 2 dockerins, to demonstrate the targeted incorporation of two enzymes into the complexes. The simultaneous binding of enzyme pairs each containing a different dockerin resulted in bi-enzymatic complexes tethered to the cell surface. The sequential binding of the two enzymes yielded insights into parameters affecting assembly of the complex such as protein size and position within the scaffold. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial organization of enzymes into complexes is an important strategy for increasing the efficiency of biochemical pathways. In this study, chimeric protein scaffolds consisting of type 1 and type 2 cohesins anchored on the surface of L. lactis allowed for the controlled positioning of dockerin-fused reporter enzymes onto the scaffolds. By binding single enzymes or enzyme pairs to the scaffolds, our data also suggest that the size and relative positions of enzymes can affect the catalytic profiles of the resulting complexes. These insights will be of great value as we engineer more advanced scaffold-guided protein complexes to optimize biochemical pathways.
TI  - Recombinant expression and purification of the antimicrobial peptide magainin-2.
AB  - Magainin-2 (MAG2) is a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin  of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. It has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and induces osmotic lysis of protozoa. MAG2 also possesses antiviral and antitumoral properties. These activities make this peptide a promising candidate for therapeutic applications. Recombinant expression systems are necessary for the affordable production of large amounts of the biologically active peptide. In this work, MAG2 has been cloned to the N-terminal of a family III carbohydrate-binding module fused to the linker sequence (LK-CBM3) from Clostridium thermocellum; a formic acid recognition site was introduced between the two modules for chemical cleavage of the peptide. The recombinant protein MAG2-LK-CBM3 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and MAG2 was successfully cleaved and purified from the fusion partner LK-CBM3. Its functionality was confirmed by testing its activity against gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cell-free biosystems for biomanufacturing.
AB  - Although cell-free biosystems have been used as a tool for investigating fundamental aspects of biological systems for more than 100 years, they are becoming an emerging biomanufacturing platform in the production of low-value biocommodities (e.g., H(2), ethanol, and isobutanol), fine chemicals, and high-value protein and carbohydrate drugs and their precursors. Here we would like to define the cell-free biosystems containing more than three catalytic components in a single reaction vessel, which although different from one-, two-, or three-enzyme biocatalysis can be regarded as a straightforward extension of multienzymatic biocatalysis. In this chapter, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of cell-free biosystems versus living organisms, briefly review the history of cell-free biosystems, highlight a few examples, analyze any remaining obstacles to the scale-up of cell-free biosystems, and suggest potential solutions. Cell-free biosystems could become a disruptive technology to microbial fermentation, especially in the production of high-impact low-value biocommodities mainly due to the very high product yields and potentially low production costs.
TI  - Crystal structure of 1,3Gal43A, an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) consists of a variety of enzymes distributed widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The mechanism by which GH43 enzymes hydrolyze oligosaccharides requires three essential acidic amino acid residues. However, one of them is thought to be missing in galactan beta-1,3-galactosidases from the GH43 family. Ct1,3Gal43A, from Clostridium thermocellum, is comprised of a GH43 domain, a CBM13 domain, and a dockerin domain and exhibits an unusual ability to hydrolyze beta-1,3-galactan in the presence of a beta-1,6 linked branch. Here, we present its crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution and complex structures of the enzyme with several substrates and analogs. Two modes of substrate binding were observed at the beta site of the CtCBM13 domain, and one galactobiose molecule was found in an "L" shaped pocket of the CtGH43 domain, which appears large enough to accommodate two more galactose units. In addition, we found that mutating Glu112 to Gln or Ala eliminated the galactan hydrolysis activity of Ct1,3Gal43A while did not disrupt its ligand binding ability. Combining this results and the crystal structure we identified Glu112 in Ct1,3Gal43A as the 'missing' essential acidic residue in galactan beta-1,3-galactosidases. Structural information presented here also suggests a mechanism by which Ct1,3Gal43A bypasses beta-1,6 linked branches in the substrate and another mechanism by which the substrate is delivered 'in trans' from the CBM13 domain to the catalytic GH43 domain.
TI  - Size-modulated synergy of cellulase clustering for enhanced cellulose hydrolysis.
AB  - Immobilization of enzymes onto nanoparticles for enhanced biocatalytic activity via enzyme clustering is a growing field. In this paper, the effect of nanoparticle size on the hydrolytic activity of artificial cellulosomes was investigated. A simple method based on metal affinity coordination was employed to directly conjugate two enzymes, an endoglucanase CelA and an exoglucanase CelE, onto CdSe-ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) without the use of any chemical modification or linker molecules such as streptavidin. Artificial cellulosomes were created by clustering the enzymes onto two different QDs (5 and 10 nm) to systematically study the influence of particle size and QD to enzyme ratio on the enhancement in cellulose hydrolysis. Our results indicate that enzyme proximity is the most important factor for activity enhancement while the influence of particle size is relatively modest. This detailed understanding will provide insights for the design of other artificial cellulosomes based on nanoclustering of multiple catalytic domains with significantly enhanced activities, and may be applicable for designing improved nanobiocatalysts for biofuel production, bioremediation, and drug design.
TI  - Influence of positioning of carbohydrate binding module on the activity of endoglucanase CelA of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - This study reports characteristics of different derivatives produced between CelA, a major endoglucanase of Clostridium thermocellum and carbohydrate binding domain of family 3a (CBM3a). In addition to the native form of the endoglucanase containing catalytic and dockerin domains (CelA-CD), its derivatives consisting of catalytic domain without dockerin domain (CelA-C), catalytic domain linked with the binding domain at N-, C- and both termini (CelA-BC, CelA-CB and CelA-BCB, respectively), two catalytic domains cloned in tandem (CelA-CC) and two catalytic domains intervened by a binding domain (CelA-CBC) were expressed in Escherichia coli at levels of 40, 43, 28, 30, 20, 20 and 10%, respectively of the total cell proteins. Specific activities of CelA-CD, CelA-C, CelA-BC, CelA-CB, CelA-CC, CelA-BCB and CelA-CBC against carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were 8.1, 7.0, 12.1, 8.5, 11.8, 10.2 and 23.5Umg(-1) enzyme while activities against pre-treated bagasse were 490, 250, 1400, 600, 810, 710 and 2270mumoles reducing sugars released per mumole of the enzyme, respectively, under the assay conditions used. Thus the activities of CelA-BC and CelA-CBC showed nearly 3- and 5-fold increase against pre-treated bagasse as compared to that of the native form of the enzyme, CelA-CD. Molecular modeling studies using MODELLER show that the binding residues of CBM3a and the active site residues of the catalytic domain are more favorably oriented for binding and hydrolysis of the polysaccharide in the case of CelA-BC as compared to those in CelA-CB, which corresponds with higher activity of the former.
TI  - Production of XynX, a large multimodular protein of thermoanaerobacterium sp., by protease-deficient Bacillus subtilis strains [corrected].
AB  - XynX of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kDa. An Escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynX produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kDa intracellularly. The Bacillus subtilis WB700 transformant with the xynX, a strain deficient in seven proteases including Vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of 65 and 44 kDa. The B. subtilis WB800 transformant with xynX, a strain deficient in eight proteases including Vpr and WprA, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 U ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kDa, than the WB700 transformant, 6.93 U ml(-1). This indicates that the additional deletion of wprA enabled the WB800 to secrete XynX in its intact form. B. subtilis WB800 produced more total enzyme activity than E. coli (1,692 +/- 274 U vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 U), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. The results suggest the potential use of B. subtilis WB800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.
TI  - Measurements of relative binding of cohesin and dockerin mutants using an advanced ELISA technique for high-affinity interactions.
AB  - The cellulosome is a large bacterial extracellular multienzyme complex able to degrade crystalline cellulosic substrates. The complex contains catalytic and noncatalytic subunits, interconnected by high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interactions. In this chapter, we introduce an optimized method for comparative binding among different cohesins or cohesin mutants to the dockerin partner. This assay offers advantages over other methods (such as ELISA, cELIA, SPR, and ITC) for particularly high-affinity binding interactions. In this approach, the high-affinity interaction of interest occurs in the liquid phase during the equilibrated binding step, whereas the interaction with the immobilized phase is used only for detection of the unbound dockerins that remain in the solution phase. Once equilibrium conditions are reached, the change in free energy of binding (DeltaDeltaG(binding)), as well as the affinity constant of mutants, can be estimated against the known affinity constant of the wild-type interaction. In light of the above, we propose this method as a preferred alternative for the relative quantification of high-affinity protein interactions.
TI  - Escherichia coli expression, purification, crystallization, and structure determination of bacterial cohesin-dockerin complexes.
AB  - Cellulosomes are highly efficient nanomachines that play a fundamental role during the anaerobic deconstruction of complex plant cell wall carbohydrates. The assembly of these complex nanomachines results from the very tight binding of repetitive cohesin modules, located in a noncatalytic molecular scaffold, and dockerin domains located at the C-terminus of the enzyme components of the cellulosome. The number of enzymes found in a cellulosome varies but may reach more than 100 catalytic subunits if cellulosomes are further organized in polycellulosomes, through a second type of cohesin-dockerin interaction. Structural studies have revealed how the cohesin-dockerin interaction mediates cellulosome assembly and cell-surface attachment, while retaining the flexibility required to potentiate catalytic synergy within the complex. Methods that might be applied for the production, purification, and structure determination of cohesin-dockerin complexes are described here.
TI  - Engineering a high-affinity scaffold for non-chromatographic protein purification via intein-mediated cleavage.
AB  - While protein purification has long been dominated by standard chromatography, the relatively high cost and complex scale-up have promoted the development of alternative non-chromatographic separation methods. Here we developed a new non-chromatographic affinity method for the purification of proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The approach is to genetically fuse the target proteins with an affinity tag. Direct purification and recovery can be achieved using a thermo-responsive elastin-like protein (ELP) scaffold containing the capturing domain. Naturally occurring cohesin-dockerin pairs, which are high-affinity protein complex responsible for the formation of cellulosome in anaerobic bacteria, were used as the model. By exploiting the highly specific interaction between the dockerin and cohesin domain from Clostridium thermocellum and the reversible aggregation property of ELP, highly purified and active dockerin-tagged proteins, such as the endoglucanase CelA, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), were recovered directly from crude cell extracts in a single thermal precipitation step with yields achieving over 90%. Incorporation of a self-cleaving intein domain enabled rapid removal of the affinity tag from the target proteins, which was subsequently removed by another cycle of thermal precipitation. This method offers great flexibility as a wide range of affinity tags and ligands can be used.
TI  - Influence of a mannan binding family 32 carbohydrate binding module on the activity of the appended mannanase.
AB  - In general, cellulases and hemicellulases are modular enzymes in which the catalytic domain is appended to one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). CBMs, by concentrating the parental enzyme at their target polysaccharide, increase the capacity of the catalytic module to bind the substrate, leading to a potentiation in catalysis. Clostridium thermocellum hypothetical protein Cthe_0821, defined here as C. thermocellum Man5A, is a modular protein comprising an N-terminal signal peptide, a family 5 glycoside hydrolase (GH5) catalytic module, a family 32 CBM (CBM32), and a C-terminal type I dockerin module. Recent proteomic studies revealed that Cthe_0821 is one of the major cellulosomal enzymes when C. thermocellum is cultured on cellulose. Here we show that the GH5 catalytic module of Cthe_0821 displays endomannanase activity. C. thermocellum Man5A hydrolyzes soluble konjac glucomannan, soluble carob galactomannan, and insoluble ivory nut mannan but does not attack the highly galactosylated mannan from guar gum, suggesting that the enzyme prefers unsubstituted beta-1,4-mannoside linkages. The CBM32 of C. thermocellum Man5A displays a preference for the nonreducing ends of mannooligosaccharides, although the protein module exhibits measurable affinity for the termini of beta-1,4-linked glucooligosaccharides such as cellobiose. CBM32 potentiates the activity of C. thermocellum Man5A against insoluble mannans but has no significant effect on the capacity of the enzyme to hydrolyze soluble galactomannans and glucomannans. The product profile of C. thermocellum Man5A is affected by the presence of CBM32.
TI  - Dcm methylation is detrimental to plasmid transformation in Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Industrial production of biofuels and other products by cellulolytic  microorganisms is of interest but hindered by the nascent state of genetic tools. Although a genetic system for Clostridium thermocellum DSM1313 has recently been developed, available methods achieve relatively low efficiency and similar plasmids can transform C. thermocellum at dramatically different efficiencies. RESULTS: We report an increase in transformation efficiency of C. thermocellum for a variety of plasmids by using DNA that has been methylated by Escherichia coli Dam but not Dcm methylases. When isolated from a dam+dcm+E. coli strain, pAMG206 transforms C. thermocellum 100-fold better than the similar plasmid pAMG205, which contains an additional Dcm methylation site in the pyrF gene. Upon removal of Dcm methylation, transformation with pAMG206 showed a four- to seven-fold increase in efficiency; however, transformation efficiency of pAMG205 increased 500-fold. Removal of the Dcm methylation site from the pAMG205 pyrF gene via silent mutation resulted in increased transformation efficiencies equivalent to that of pAMG206. Upon proper methylation, transformation efficiency of plasmids bearing the pMK3 and pB6A origins of replication increased ca. three orders of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli Dcm methylation decreases transformation efficiency in C. thermocellum DSM1313. The use of properly methylated plasmid DNA should facilitate genetic manipulation of this industrially relevant bacterium.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a thermophilic biotin biosynthetic enzyme, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase, from various thermophiles.
AB  - By detailed BLAST searches of the genome database of various thermophiles, five ORFs with similarity to the bioF gene, which encodes 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase (BioF) involved in biotin biosynthesis, of Escherichia coli were found: AqbioF, CltbioF, GkbioF, SytbioF, and TsebioF, from Aquifex aeolicus VF5, Clostridium thermocellum ATCC27405, Geobacillus kaustophilus JCM12893, Symbiobacterium thermophilum IAM14863, and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 respectively. The five purified recombinant bioF gene products, which were overexpressed in E. coli, had the enzyme activity of BioF. The optimum temperature range and thermostability of five BioFs, AqBioF, CltBioF, GkBioF, SytBioF, and TseBioF, were higher than those of E. coli BioF. In particular, AqBioF was found to show the highest thermostability of the alpha-oxoamine synthase family enzymes reported to date. Substrate specificity experiments revealed that SytBioF was also able to catalyze the reaction of 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase, a member of the alpha-oxoamine synthase family, and that it used acetyl-CoA and glycine as substrates, like the TTHA1582 protein of Thermus thermophilus. The other purified BioFs, AqBioF and GkBioF, did not show any activity with acyl-CoAs and amino acids other than pimeloyl-CoA and L-alanine as substrates.
TI  - Bioethanol production involving recombinant C. thermocellum hydrolytic hemicellulase and fermentative microbes.
AB  - The enhancement of the biomass productivity of Escherichia coli cells harbouring  the truncated 903 bp gene designated as glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) from Clostridium thermocellum showing hemicellulase activity along with its further use in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process is described. (Phosphoric acid) H(3)PO(4)-acetone treatment and ammonia fibre expansion (AFEX) were the pretreatment strategies employed on the leafy biomass of mango, poplar, neem and asoka among various substrates owing to their high hemicellulose content. GH43 showed optimal activity at a temperature of 50 degrees C, pH 5.4 with stability over a pH range of 5.0-6.2. A 4-fold escalation in growth of the recombinant E. coli cells was observed when grown using repeated batch strategy in LB medium supplemented with glucose as co-substrate. Candida shehatae utilizing pentose sugars was employed for bioethanol production. AFEX pretreatment proved to be better over acid-acetone technique. The maximum ethanol concentration (1.44 g/L) was achieved for AFEX pretreated mango (1%, w/v) followed by poplar with an ethanol titre (1.32 g/L) in shake flask experiments. A 1.5-fold increase in ethanol titre (2.11 g/L) was achieved with mango (1%, w/v) in a SSF process using a table top 2-L bioreactor with 1 L working volume.
TI  - The complex structures of isocitrate dehydrogenase from Clostridium thermocellum  and Desulfotalea psychrophila suggest a new active site locking mechanism.
AB  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) catalyzes the oxidative NAD(P)(+)-dependent decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate and CO2 and is present in organisms spanning the biological range of temperature. We have solved two crystal structures of the thermophilic Clostridium thermocellum IDH (CtIDH), a native open apo CtIDH to 2.35 A and a quaternary complex of CtIDH with NADP(+), isocitrate and Mg(2+) to 2.5 A. To compare to these a quaternary complex structure of the psychrophilic Desulfotalea psychrophila IDH (DpIDH) was also resolved to 1.93 A. CtIDH and DpIDH showed similar global thermal stabilities with melting temperatures of 67.9 and 66.9 degrees C, respectively. CtIDH represents a typical thermophilic enzyme, with a large number of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds per residue combined with stabilization of the N and C termini. CtIDH had a higher activity temperature optimum, and showed greater affinity for the substrates with an active site that was less thermolabile compared to DpIDH. The uncompensated negative surface charge and the enlarged methionine cluster in the hinge region both of which are important for cold activity in DpIDH, were absent in CtIDH. These structural comparisons revealed that prokaryotic IDHs in subfamily II have a unique locking mechanism involving Arg310, Asp251' and Arg255 (CtIDH). These interactions lock the large domain to the small domain and direct NADP(+) into the correct orientation, which together are important for NADP(+) selectivity.
TI  - Enhanced soluble expression of a thermostable cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In this study, the cellulase gene celD from Clostridium thermocellum was cloned into expression vectors pET-20b(+) and pHsh. While high expression can be achieved by means of both these expression systems, only the pHsh expression system gives soluble proteins. By weakening the mRNA secondary structure and replacing the rare codons for the N-terminal amino acids of the target protein, the expression level of CelD was increased from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.4 +/- 0.4 U ml(-1) in LB medium. Recombinant CelD was purified by heat treatment followed by Ni-NTA affinity. The purified CelD exhibited the highest activity at pH 5.4 and 60 degrees C, and retained more than 50% activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 1 h. The cellulase activity of CelD was significantly enhanced by Ca(2+) but inhibited by EDTA. The favorable properties of CelD offer the potential for genetic modification of strains for biomass degradation. Presently, one of the major bottlenecks for industrial cellulase users is the high cost of enzyme production. The high level expression of soluble enzymes from the pHsh expression system offers a novel approach for the production of cellulases to be used in various agro-industrial processes such as chemical, food and textile.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a fusion beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase to improve hydrolytic activity and thermostability.
AB  - A new fusion gene (Bgl-licMB), encoding beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase both from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Bgl) and Clostridium thermocellum (licMB), was constructed via end-to-end fusion and expressed in Escherichia coli to improve hydrolytic activity and thermostability of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase. The results of enzymatic properties showed that the catalytic efficiency (K(cat)/K(m)) of the fusion enzyme for oat beta-glucan was 2.7 and 20-fold higher than that of the parental Bgl and licMB, respectively, and that the fusion enzyme can retain more than 50% of activity following incubation at 80 degrees C for 30 min, whereas the residual activities of Bgl and licMB were both less than 30%. These properties make this particular beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase a good candidate for application in brewing and animal-feed industries.
TI  - Expression of family 3 cellulose-binding module (CBM3) as an affinity tag for recombinant proteins in yeast.
AB  - Easy and low-cost protein purification methods for the mass production of commonly used enzymes that play important roles in biotechnology are in high demand. In this study, we developed a fast, low-cost recombinant protein purification system in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris using the family 3 cellulose-binding module (CBM3)-based affinity tag. The codon of the cbm3 gene from Clostridium thermocellum was optimized based on the codon usage of P. pastoris. The CBM3 tag was then fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (CBM3-EGFP) or with inulinase and expressed in P. pastoris to demonstrate its ability to function as an affinity tag in a yeast expression system. We also examined the effects of glycosylation on the secreted CBM3-tag. The secreted wild-type CBM3-EGFP was glycosylated; however, this had little influence on the adsorption of the fusion protein to the regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC; maximum adsorption capacity of 319 mg/g). Two CBM3-EGFP mutants lacking glycosylation sites were also constructed. The three CBM3-EGFPs expressed in P. pastoris and the CBM3-EGFP expressed in Escherichia coli all had similar RAC adsorption capacity. To construct a tag-free recombinant protein purification system based on CBM3, a CBM3-intein-EGFP fusion protein was expressed in P. pastoris. This fusion protein was stably expressed and the self-cleavage of intein was efficiently induced by DTT or L: -cysteine. In this study, we were able to purify the recombinant fusion protein with high efficiency using both intein and direct fusion-based strategies.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new cellulosome-producing Clostridium thermocellum strain.
AB  - The anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, is a potent cellulolytic microorganism that produces large extracellular multienzyme complexes called cellulosomes. To isolate C. thermocellum organisms that possess effective cellulose-degrading ability, new thermophilic cellulolytic strains were screened from more than 800 samples obtained mainly from agriculture residues in Thailand using microcrystalline cellulose as a carbon source. A new strain, C. thermocellum S14, having high cellulose-degrading ability was isolated from bagasse paper sludge. Cellulosomes prepared from S14 demonstrated faster degradation of microcrystalline cellulose, and 3.4- and 5.6-fold greater Avicelase activity than those from C. thermocellum ATCC27405 and JW20 (ATCC31449), respectively. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that S14 had unique cell surface features with few protuberances in contrast to the type strains. In addition, the cellulosome of S14 was resistant to inhibition by cellobiose that is a major end product of cellulose hydrolysis. Saccharification tests conducted using rice straw soaked with sodium hydroxide indicated the cellulosome of S14 released approximately 1.5-fold more total sugars compared to that of ATCC27405. This newly isolated S14 strain has the potential as an enzyme resource for effective lignocellulose degradation.
TI  - Ultra-stable phosphoglucose isomerase through immobilization of cellulose-binding module-tagged thermophilic enzyme on low-cost high-capacity cellulosic adsorbent.
AB  - One-step enzyme purification and immobilization were developed based on simple adsorption of a family 3 cellulose-binding module (CBM)-tagged protein on the external surface of high-capacity regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). An open reading frame (ORF) Cthe0217 encoding a putative phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9) from a thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum was cloned and the recombinant proteins with or without CBM were over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The rate constant (kcat ) and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km ) of CBM-free PGI at 60 degrees C were 2,765 s(-1) and 2.89 mM, respectively. PGI was stable at a high protein concentration of 0.1 g/L but deactivated rapidly at low concentrations. Immobilized CBM (iCBM)-PGI on RAC was extremely stable at approximately 60 degrees C, nearly independent of its mass concentration in bulk solution, because its local concentration on the solid support was constant. iCBM-PGI at a low concentration of 0.001 g/L had a half-life time of 190 h, approximately 80-fold of that of free PGI. Total turn-over number of iCBM-PGI was as high as 1.1x10(9) mole of product per mole of enzyme at 60 degrees C. These results suggest that a combination of low-cost enzyme immobilization and thermoenzyme led to an ultra-stable enzyme building block suitable for cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation that can implement complicated biochemical reactions in vitro.
TI  - Assembly of minicellulosomes on the surface of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - To cost-efficiently produce biofuels, new methods are needed to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. One promising approach is to degrade biomass using cellulosomes, which are surface-displayed multicellulase-containing complexes present in cellulolytic Clostridium and Ruminococcus species. In this study we created cellulolytic strains of Bacillus subtilis that display one or more cellulase enzymes. Proteins containing the appropriate cell wall sorting signal are covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan by coexpressing them with the Bacillus anthracis sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase. This approach was used to covalently attach the Cel8A endoglucanase from Clostridium thermocellum to the cell wall. In addition, a Cel8A-dockerin fusion protein was anchored on the surface of B. subtilis via noncovalent interactions with a cell wall-attached cohesin module. We also demonstrate that it is possible to assemble multienzyme complexes on the cell surface. A three-enzyme-containing minicellulosome was displayed on the cell surface; it consisted of a cell wall-attached scaffoldin protein noncovalently bound to three cellulase-dockerin fusion proteins that were produced in Escherichia coli. B. subtilis has a robust genetic system and is currently used in a wide range of industrial processes. Thus, grafting larger, more elaborate minicellulosomes onto the surface of B. subtilis may yield cellulolytic bacteria with increased potency that can be used to degrade biomass.
TI  - [Transgenic tomato plants expressing recA and NLS-recA-licBM3 genes as a model for studying meiotic recombination].
AB  - Homologous DNA recombination in eukaryotes is necessary to maintain genome stability and integrity and for correct chromosome segregation and formation of new haplotypes in meiosis. At the same time, genetic determination and nonrandomness of meiotic recombination restrict the introgression of genes and generation of unique genotypes. As one of the approaches to study and induce meiotic recombination in plants, it is recommended to use the recA gene of Escherichia coli. It is shown that the recA and NLS-recA-licBM3 genes have maternal inheritance and are expressed in the progeny of transgenic tomato plants. Plants expressing recA or NLS-recA-licBM3 and containing one T-DNA insertion do not differ in pollen fertility from original nontransgenic forms and can therefore be used for comparative studies of the effect of bacterial recombinases on meiotic recombination between linked genes.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Glutamate production from beta-glucan using endoglucanase-secreting Corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  - We demonstrate glutamate production from beta-glucan using endoglucanase (EG)-expressing Corynebacterium glutamicum. The signal sequence torA derived from Escherichia coli K12, which belongs to the Tat pathway, was suitable for secreting EG of Clostridium thermocellum using C. glutamicum as a host. Using the torA signal sequence, endoglucanase from Clostridium cellulovorans 743B was successfully expressed, and the secreted EG produced 123 mg of reducing sugar from 5 g of beta-glucan at 30 degrees C for 72 h, which is the optimal condition for C. glutamicum growth. Subsequently, glutamate fermentation from beta-glucan was carried out with the addition of Aspergillus aculeatus beta-glucosidase produced by recombinant Aspergillus oryzae. Using EG-secreting C. glutamicum, 178 mg/l of glutamate was produced from 15 g of beta-glucan. This is the first report of glutamate fermentation from beta-glucan using endoglucanase-secreting C. glutamicum.
TI  - The role of carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) repeat of a multimodular xylanase (XynX) from Clostridium thermocellum in cellulose and xylan binding.
AB  - A non-cellulosomal xylanase from Clostridium thermocellum, XynX, consists of a family-22 carbohydratebinding module (CBM22), a family-10 glycoside hydrolase (GH10) catalytic module, two family-9 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM9-I and CBM9-II), and an S-layer homology (SLH) module. E. coli BL21(DE3) (pKM29), a transformant carrying xynX', produced several truncated forms of the enzyme. Among them, three major active species were purified by SDS-PAGE, activity staining, gel-slicing, and diffusion from the gel. The truncated xylanases were different from each other only in their C-terminal regions. In addition to the CBM22 and GH10 catalytic modules, XynX(1) had the CBM9-I and most of the CBM9-II, XynX(2) had the CBM9-I and about 40% of the CBM9-II, and XynX(3) had about 75% of the CBM9-I. The truncated xylanases showed higher binding capacities toward Avicel than those toward insoluble xylan. XynX(1) showed a higher affinity toward Avicel (70.5%) than XynX(2) (46.0%) and XynX(3) (42.1%); however, there were no significant differences in the affinities toward insoluble xylan. It is suggested that the CBM9 repeat, especially CBM9-II, of XynX plays a role in xylan degradation in nature by strengthening cellulose binding rather than by enhancing xylan binding.
TI  - Construction and characterization of different fusion proteins between cellulases and beta-glucosidase to improve glucose production and thermostability.
AB  - A beta-glucosidase from Clostridium cellulovorans (CcBG) was fused with one of three different types of cellulases from Clostridium thermocellum, including a cellulosomal endoglucanase CelD (CtCD), a cellulosomal exoglucanase CBHA (CtCA) and a non-cellulosomal endoglucanase Cel9I (CtC9I). Six bifunctional enzymes were constructed with either beta-glucosidase or cellulase in the upstream. CtCD-CcBG showed the favorable specific activities on phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), an amorphous cellulose, with more glucose production (2 folds) and less cellobiose accumulation (3 folds) when compared with mixture of the single enzymes. Moreover, CtCD-CcBG had significantly improved thermal stability with a melting temperature (T(m)) of 10.9 degrees C higher than that of CcBG (54.5 degrees C) based on the CD unfolding experiments. This bifunctional enzyme is thus useful in industrial application to convert cellulose to glucose.
TI  - A novel bifunctional endo-/exo-type cellulase from an anaerobic ruminal bacterium.
AB  - An anaerobic microorganism termed AN-C16-KBRB was isolated from the bovine rumen  and demonstrated cellulolytic activity on a NB agar plate containing azo-carboxymethyl cellulose. The 16S rRNA gene of the strain was 98% similar to that of Clostridiaceae bacterium SK082 (AB298754) as the highest homology. A novel celEdx16 gene encoding a bifunctional endo-/exocellulase (CelEdx16) was cloned by the shotgun method from AN-C16-KBRB, and the enzyme was characterized. The celEdx16 gene had an open reading frame of 1,104-base pairs, which encoded 367 amino acids to yield a protein of molecular mass 40.4 kDa. The amino acid sequence was 53% identical to that of an endoglucanase from Clostridium thermocellum. CelEdx16 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The specific endocellulase and exocellulase activities of CelEdx16 were 15.9 and 3.6 x 10(-)(2) U mg(-)(1), respectively. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K (m) values) and the maximal reaction velocities (V(max) values) of CelEdx16 were 47.1 muM and 9.6 x 10(-)(3) mumole min(-)(1) when endocellulase activity was measured and 106.3 muM and 2.1 x 10(-)(5) mumol min(-)(1) when exocellulase activity was assessed. CelEdx16 was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 40 degrees C.
TI  - Characterization of a dockerin-based affinity tag: application for purification of a broad variety of target proteins.
AB  - Cellulose, a major component of plant matter, is degraded by a cell surface multiprotein complex called the cellulosome produced by several anaerobic bacteria. This complex coordinates the assembly of different glycoside hydrolases, via a high-affinity Ca(2+)-dependent interaction between the enzyme-borne dockerin and the scaffoldin-borne cohesin modules. In this study, we characterized a new protein affinity tag, DeltaDoc, a truncated version (48 residues) of the Clostridium thermocellum Cel48S dockerin. The truncated dockerin tag has a binding affinity (K(A)) of 7.7 x 10(8)M(-1), calculated by a competitive enzyme-linked assay system. In order to examine whether the tag can be used for general application in affinity chromatography, it was fused to a range of target proteins, including Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), C. thermocellum beta-glucosidase, Escherichia coli thioesterase/protease I (TEP1), and the antibody-binding ZZ-domain from Staphylococcus aureus protein A. The results of this study significantly extend initial studies performed using the Geobacillus stearothermophilus xylanase T-6 as a model system. In addition, the enzymatic activity of a C. thermocellum beta-glucosidase, purified using this approach, was tested and found to be similar to that of a beta-glucosidase preparation (without the DeltaDoc tag) purified using the standard His-tag. The truncated dockerin derivative functioned as an effective affinity tag through specific interaction with a cognate cohesin, and highly purified target proteins were obtained in a single step directly from crude cell extracts. The relatively inexpensive beaded cellulose-based affinity column was reusable and maintained high capacity after each cycle. This study demonstrates that deletion into the first Ca(2+)-binding loop of the dockerin module results in an efficient and robust affinity tag that can be generally applied for protein purification.
TI  - [Substrate-binding properties of family 54 module of laminarinase Lic16A of Clostridium thermocelwnum].
AB  - Endo beta-1.3-1.4-glucanase Lic16A of the moderate thermophilic anaerobe Clostridium thermocellum has a complex multimodular structure. In addition to the catalytic module it contains 8 auxiliary modules, 5 of which are substrate binding modules. The new family 54 substrate binding module CBM54 (25.2 kDa), localized at the N-terminus of the enzyme, owns a cleavage site, in its N-terminal part manifested by the appearance of a shortened module CBM54C (17.2 kDa) in vivo and in vito. CBM54C was cloned in Escherichia coli cells and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The binding constants of CBM54C to xylan, chitin, insoluble B-glucan of yeast cell wall and bacterial crystalline cellulose were in the same order of magnitude as for CBM54. However CBM54C, unlike CBM54, did not bind pustulan, avicel, and chitosan. Nevertheless the presence of calcium ions restored the ability of CBM54C to bind the latter three carbohydrates. CBM54 substrate binding promiscuity permits to suggest the presence of multiple binding sites, some of them calcium dependent. The collected data allow to localize Ca2+ -independent sites for avicel, pustulan an d chitosan binding inthe spontaneously split-off CBM54 N-terminal area (8 kDa). In this report the localization scheme of Ca2+ -dependent and Ca2+ -independent binding sites for various substrates has been suggested.
TI  - Influence of transposition and insertion of additional binding domain on expression and characteristics of xylanase C of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum encodes a xylanase gene (xynC) which is the major component of its cellulosome. XynC is a multidomain enzyme comprising of a substrate binding domain at the N-terminal followed by the catalytic domain and a dockerin domain. To study the influence of binding domain on activity, stability and expression of the enzyme the protein with the binding domain at C-terminal (XynC-CB), and the one with the binding domain at both N- and C-terminal (XynC-BCB) were expressed in E. coli. Recombinant plasmids, pXynC-CB and pXynC-BCB were constructed by inserting the corresponding gene in pET22b(+). XynC-CB and XynC-BCB were expressed at levels around 30% and 33% of the total E. coli cell proteins, respectively, while losing 40% and 20% of their activities at 70 degrees C for 120 min, respectively. The specific activities of XynC-CB, XynC-BCB were 76 and 98 U mg(-1), while the activities on equimolar basis were 4410 and 7450 U muM(-1) against birchwood xylan, respectively. Their overall activities produced in the culture were 3660 and 5430 U L(-1) OD(600)(-1). Substrate binding studies showed that in case of XynC-C 51% of the activity remained unbound to birchwood xylan, whereas in the cases of XynC-BC, XynC-CB and XynC-BCB the activities left unbound were 33%, 32% and 12%, respectively, under the assay conditions used. Similar binding values were obtained in the case of oat spelt xylan. K(m) values for XynC-CB and XynC-BCB against birchwood xylan were found to be 3.1 and 1.47 mg ml(-1), respectively. Thus addition of a second carbohydrate binding domain at the C-terminal of the catalytic domain enhances activity, substrate affinity as well as thermostability.
TI  - Effect of the C-terminal domains and terminal residues of catalytic domain on enzymatic activity and thermostability of lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - To elucidate the effects of C-terminal domains of LicMB (mature lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum) and terminal residues of LicMB-CD (catalytic domain of LicMB) on the properties of lichenase, a series of truncated genes were constructed and expressed in E. coli. The Thr-Pro box had a positive effect while the dockerin domain had a negative impact on the properties of LicMB. The N-terminal 10-25th and C-terminal 1-9th residues of LicMB-CD were necessary to retain high thermostability while the N-terminal 1-7th and C-terminal 1-3rd residues were not necessary to maintain enzymatic activity.
TI  - Escherichia coli expression and purification of LL37 fused to a family III carbohydrate-binding module from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The cathelicidin derived human peptide LL37 has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. The large variety of biological activities makes LL37 a very promising candidate for clinical applications. The production of biologically active LL37 in large amounts with reduced costs can only be achieved using recombinant techniques. In this work, LL37 has been cloned to the N- and C-termini of a family III carbohydrate-binding module fused to the linker sequence (LK-CBM3) from Clostridium thermocellum; both constructions (LL37-LK-CBM3 and LK-CBM3-LL37) were cloned into the pET-21a vector. A formic acid recognition site was introduced between the two modules, allowing the isolation of LL37 after chemical cleavage. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and solubilized with Triton X-100. The purification was achieved using cellulose CF11 fibers, taking advantage of the CBM3 specific affinity for cellulose; after hydrolysis with formic acid, LL37 was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC, as confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The production and purification methodology developed in this work compares advantageously to other protocols previously described, having fewer purification steps. Only the recombinant LL37 obtained from the C-terminally fused protein (LK-CBM3-LL37) showed antibacterial activity against E. coli K12, with a MIC of 180 microg/ml.
TI  - Functional assembly of minicellulosomes on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  - We demonstrated the functional display of a miniscaffoldin on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface consisting of three divergent cohesin domains from Clostridium thermocellum (t), Clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (f). Incubation with Escherichia coli lysates containing an endoglucanase (CelA) fused with a dockerin domain from C. thermocellum (At), an exoglucanase (CelE) from C. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from the same species (Ec), and an endoglucanase (CelG) from C. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from R. flavefaciens (Gf) resulted in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast cell surface. The displayed minicellulosome retained the synergistic effect for cellulose hydrolysis. When a beta-glucosidase (BglA) from C. thermocellum tagged with the dockerin from R. flavefaciens was used in place of Gf, cells displaying the new minicellulosome exhibited significantly enhanced glucose liberation and produced ethanol directly from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. The final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/liter was 2.6-fold higher than that obtained by using the same amounts of added purified cellulases. The overall yield was 0.49 g of ethanol produced per g of carbohydrate consumed, which corresponds to 95% of the theoretical value. This result confirms that simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol can be efficiently accomplished with a yeast strain displaying a functional minicellulosome containing all three required cellulolytic enzymes.
TI  - A highly active phosphoglucomutase from Clostridium thermocellum: cloning, purification, characterization and enhanced thermostability.
AB  - AIMS: Discovery and utilization of highly active and thermostable phosphoglucomutase (PGM) would be vital for biocatalysis mediated by multiple enzymes, for example, high-yield production of enzymatic hydrogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum was hypothesized to have a very active PGM because of its key role in microbial cellulose utilization. The Cl. thermocellum ORF Cthe1265 encoding a putative PGM was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme appeared to be a monomer with an estimated molecular weight of 64.9 kDa. This enzyme was found to be a dual-specificity enzyme - PGM/phosphomannomutase (PMM). Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) were activators. Ser144 was identified as an essential catalytic residue through site-directed mutagenesis. The k(cat) and K(m) of PGM were 190 s(-1) and 0.41 mmol l(-1) on glucose-1-phosphate and 59 s(-1) and 0.44 mmol l(-1) on mannose-1-phosphate, respectively, at 60 degrees C. Thermostability of PGM at a low concentration (2 nmol l(-1), 100 U l(-1)) was enhanced by 12-fold (i.e. t(1/2) = 72 h) at 60 degrees C with addition of bovine serum albumin, Triton X-100, Mg(2+)and Mn(2+). CONCLUSIONS: The ORF Cthe1265 was confirmed to encode a PGM with PMM activity. This enzyme was the most active PGM reported. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This highly active PGM with enhanced thermostability would be an important building block for in vitro synthetic biology projects (complicated biotransformation mediated by multiple enzymes in one pot).
TI  - Physical association of the catalytic and helper modules of a family-9 glycoside  hydrolase is essential for activity.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum cellulase 9I (Cel9I) is a non-cellulosomal tri-modular enzyme, consisting of a family-9 glycoside hydrolase (GH9) catalytic module and two family-3 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM3c and CBM3b). The presence of CBM3c was previously shown to be essential for activity, however the mechanism by which it functions is unclear. We expressed the three recombinant modules independently in Escherichia coli and examined their interactions. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and affinity purification of the GH9-CBM3c complex revealed a specific non-covalent binding interaction between the GH9 module and CBM3c. Their physical association was shown to recover 60-70% of the intact Cel9I endoglucanase activity.
TI  - Engineering of a multifunctional hemicellulase.
AB  - To engineer a multifunctional xylan-degrading enzyme, a chimera was created by fusing the xylanase domain of the Clostridium thermocellum xylanase (xynZ) and a dual functional arabinofuranosidase/xylosidase (DeAFc; from a compost starter mixture) through a flexible peptide linker. The xylanase domain of xynZ possesses previously unreported endoglucanase activity. The chimera, possessing the activities of xylanase, endoglucanase, arabinofuranosidase and xylosidase, was expressed in E. coli and purified. The chimera closely resembled the parental enzymes in pH, temperature optima and kinetics, and was more active than the parental enzyme mixture in the hydrolysis of natural xylans and corn stover.
TI  - Novel substrates of a ribose-5-phosphate isomerase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - A substrate specificity study of the recombinant D-ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RpiB) from Clostridium thermocellum was performed. Among all aldopentoses and aldohexoses, the RpiB enzyme displayed activity with L-talose, D-ribose, D-allose, L-allose, L-ribose, and D-talose in decreasing order. The products released were L-tagatose, D-ribulose, D-psicose, L-psicose, L-ribulose, and D-tagatose, respectively. The enzyme showed specificity for aldose substrates possessing hydroxyl groups oriented in the same direction at the C2, C3, and C4 positions. Molecular modeling of the enzyme suggests that the novel substrate specificity may be explained by substrate interactions with residues Tyr42, His98, and His9, which interact with the hydroxyl groups of C2, C3, and C4, respectively, oriented in the same direction. L-Talose and D-ribulose exhibited the highest activity among the aldoses and ketoses, respectively. Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase catalyzed the conversion of L-talose to L-tagatose with an 89% conversion yield after approximately 90 min, while D-ribulose was converted to D-ribose with a 38% conversion yield.
TI  - Bacterial CMP-sialic acid synthetases: production, properties, and applications.
AB  - Sialic acids are abundant nine-carbon sugars expressed terminally on glycoconjugates of eukaryotic cells and are crucial for a variety of cell biological functions such as cell-cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and in regulation of glycoproteins stability. In bacteria, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) polymers are important virulence factors. Cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (CSS; EC 2.7.7.43), the key enzyme that synthesizes CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, the donor molecule for numerous sialyltransferase reactions, is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic systems. Herein, we emphasize the source, function, and biotechnological applications of CSS enzymes from bacterial sources. To date, only a few CSS from pathogenic bacterial species such as Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Pasteurella hemolytica and an enzyme from nonpathogenic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, have been described. Overall, the enzymes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria share common catalytic properties such as their dependency on divalent cation, temperature and pH profiles, and catalytic mechanisms. The enzymes, however, can be categorized as smaller and larger enzymes depending on their molecular weight. The larger enzymes in some cases are bifunctional; they have exhibited acetylhydrolase activity in addition to their sugar nucleotidyltransferase activity. The CSSs are important enzymes for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of various sialooligosaccharides of significance in biotechnology.
TI  - Molecular characterization of polychlorinated biphenyl-dechlorinating populations in contaminated sediments.
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-dechlorinating microorganisms were characterized in PCB-contaminated sediments using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The sediments were prepared by spiking Aroclor 1248 into PCB-free sediments, and were inoculated with microorganisms eluted from St. Lawrence River sediments. PCB-free sediments inoculated with the same inoculum served as the control. Four restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) groups in the eubacterial and two in the archaeal domain were found exclusively in PCB-spiked sediment clone libraries. Sequence analysis of the four eubacterial clones showed homology to Escherichia coli, Lactosphaera pasteurii, Clostridium thermocellum, and Dehalobacter restrictus. The predominant archaeal sequence in the PCB-spiked sediment clone library was closely related to Methanosarcina barkeri, which appear to support earlier findings that methanogens are involved in PCB dechlorination. When the dot-blot hybridization was performed between the sediment DNA extract and the probes designed with eubacterial RFLP groups, the intensity of two of eubacterial RFLP groups, which showed high sequence homology to C. pascui and D. restrictus, was highly correlated with the number of dechlorinating microorganisms suggesting these two members intend to contribute to PCB dechlorination.
TI  - Escherichia coli expression and purification of four antimicrobial peptides fused to a family 3 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are molecules that act in a wide range of physiological defensive mechanisms developed to counteract bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Several hundreds of AMPs have been identified and characterized. These molecules are presently gaining increasing importance, as a consequence of their remarkable resistance to microorganism adaptation. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are non-catalytic domains that anchor glycoside hydrolases into complex carbohydrates. Clostridium thermocellum produces a multi-enzyme complex of cellulases and hemicellulases, termed the cellulosome, which is organized by the scaffoldin protein CipA. Binding of the cellulosome to the plant cell wall results from the action of CipA family 3 CBM (CBM3), which presents a high affinity for crystalline cellulose. Here CipA family 3 CBM was fused to four different AMPs using recombinant DNA technology and the fusion recombinant proteins were expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli cells. CBM3 does not present antibacterial activity and does not bind to the bacterial surface. However, the four recombinant proteins retained the ability to bind cellulose, suggesting that CBM3 is a good candidate polypeptide to direct the binding of AMPs into cellulosic supports. A comprehensive characterization of the antimicrobial activity of the recombinant fusion proteins is currently under evaluation.
TI  - Two proteins with diaphorase activity from Clostridium thermocellum and Moorella  thermoacetica.
AB  - Two high-molecular-weight rubredoxin genes (hrb) from Clostridium thermocellum and Moorella thermoacetica were expressed in Escherichia coli and their translated products (Hrb) were characterized. M. thermoacetica Hrb showed strong diaphorase activity. In contrast, C. thermocellum Hrb, containing neither FMN nor FAD in the molecule, showed flavin reductase activity with moderate diaphorase activity. Both enzymes were optimally active at about 50 degrees C.
TI  - Functional asymmetry in cohesin binding belies inherent symmetry of the dockerin  module: insight into cellulosome assembly revealed by systematic mutagenesis.
AB  - The cellulosome is an intricate multi-enzyme complex, known for its efficient degradation of recalcitrant cellulosic substrates. Its supramolecular architecture is determined by the high-affinity intermodular cohesin-dockerin interaction. The dockerin module comprises a calcium-binding, duplicated 'F-hand' loop-helix motif that bears striking similarity to the EF-hand loop-helix-loop motif of eukaryotic calcium-binding proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate by progressive truncation and alanine scanning of a representative type-I dockerin module from Clostridium thermocellum, that only one of the repeated motifs is critical for high-affinity cohesin binding. The results suggest that the near-symmetry in sequence and structure of the repeated elements of the dockerin is not essential to cohesin binding. The first calcium-binding loop can be deleted entirely, with almost full retention of binding. Likewise, significant deletion of the second repeated segment can be achieved, provided that its calcium-binding loop remains intact. Essentially the same conclusion was verified by systematically mutating the highly conserved residues in the calcium-binding loop. Mutations in one of the calcium-binding loops failed to disrupt cohesin recognition and binding, whereas a single mutation in both loops served to reduce the affinity significantly. The results are mutually compatible with recent crystal structures of the type-I cohesin-dockerin heterodimer, which demonstrate that the dockerin can bind in an equivalent manner to its cohesin counterpart through either its first or second repeated motif. The observed plasticity in cohesin-dockerin binding may facilitate cellulosome assembly in vivo or, alternatively, provide a conformational switch that promotes access of the tethered cellulosomal enzymes to their polysaccharide substrates.
TI  - Heterologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis of endoglucanase CelA from  Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The endoglucanase CelA from Clostridium thermocellum was strongly expressed in Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme was purified by Ni(2+)-affinity chromatography. Site-directed substitution of D278 with an asparagine or an alanine residue surprisingly did not decrease the apparent k(cat) value. Further substitutions of two other potentially critical residues, Y215 and D152, resulted in a 2-fold decrease in apparent k(cat) value for Y215P and complete loss of activity for D152N.
TI  - Characterization of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase of Clostridium thermocellum producing D-allose from D-psicose.
AB  - The rpiB gene, encoding ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RpiB) from Clostridium thermocellum, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. RpiB converted D-psicose into D-allose but it did not convert D-xylose, L-rhamnose, D-altrose or D-galactose. The production of D-allose by RpiB was maximal at pH 7.5 and 65 degrees C for 30 min. The half-lives of the enzyme at 50 degrees C and 65 degrees C were 96 h and 4.7 h, respectively. Under stable conditions of pH 7.5 and 50 degrees C, 165 g D-allose l(-1 ) was produced without by-products from 500 g D-psicose l(-1) after 6 h.
TI  - Induction of the celC operon of Clostridium thermocellum by laminaribiose.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum is an anaerobic, thermophilic, cellulolytic, and ethanogenic bacterium. It produces an extracellular multiprotein complex termed the cellulosome, which consists of >70 subunits, most of them glycosyl hydrolases. It also produces many free glycosyl hydrolases. How the organism commands such a large number of genes and proteins for biomass degradation is an intriguing yet unresolved question. We identified glyR3, which is cotranscribed with the cellulase/hemicellulase genes celC and licA, as a potential cellulase transcription regulator. The gel-shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the recombinant GlyR3 bound specifically to the celC promoter region. GlyR3 was also identified from the lysate of the lichenan-grown cells, which bound to the same sequence. DNase I footprinting and competitive EMSA showed the binding site to be an 18-bp palindromic sequence with one mismatch. The DNA-binding activity was specifically inhibited by laminaribiose, a beta-1-3 linked glucose dimer, in a dose-dependent manner. In in vitro transcription analysis, celC expression was repressed by rGlyR3 in a dose-dependent manner. The repression was relieved by laminaribiose, also in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that GlyR3 is a negative regulator of the celC operon consisting of celC, glyR3, and licA, and inducible by laminaribiose. Thus, the bacterium may modulate the biosynthesis of its enzyme components to optimize its activity on an available biomass substrate, in this case, beta-1-3 glucan, because both CelC and LicA are active on the substrate. The results further indicate that, despite the insolubility of the biomass substrate, regulation of the degradative enzymes can be accomplished through soluble sugars generated by the action of the enzymes.
TI  - Immobilization of mouse single-chain antibodies for affinity chromatography using the cellulose-binding protein.
AB  - A laboratory method for obtaining immunoaffinity medium for chromatographic purification of recombinant human interferon alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) is described. The method is based on oriented and non-covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody fragments on cellulose. The single-chain fragment variable (ScFv) against human IFN-alpha2b was genetically fused to cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome and expressed in Escherichia coli. After the isolation of the target protein in functionally active form from bacteria cells its bioaffinity immobilization on several forms of cellulose powders has been carried out. The crystalline microgranular cellulose with immobilized ScFv-CBD-fusion protein was used as affinity medium to perform the purification of recombinant human IFN-alpha2b directly from clarified extract of E. coli cells.
TI  - Two noncellulosomal cellulases of Clostridium thermocellum, Cel9I and Cel48Y, hydrolyse crystalline cellulose synergistically.
AB  - The genome of Clostridium thermocellum contains a number of genes for polysaccharide degradation-associated proteins that are not cellulosome bound. The list includes beta-glucanases, glycosidases, chitinases, amylases and a xylanase. One of these 'soluble'-enzyme genes codes for a second glycosyl hydrolase (GH)48 cellulase, Cel48Y, which was expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized. It is a cellobiohydrolyse with activity on native cellulose such as microcrystalline and bacterial cellulose, and low activity on carboxymethylcellulose. It is about 100 times as active on amorphic cellulose and mixed-linkage barley beta-glucan compared with cellulase Cel9I. The enzyme Cel48Y shows a distinct synergism of 2.1 times with the noncellulosomal processive endoglucanase Cel9I on highly crystalline bacterial cellulose at a 17-fold excess of Cel48Y over Cel9I. These data show that C. thermocellum has, besides the cellulosome, the genes for a second cellulase system for the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose that is not particle bound.
TI  - Application of gene-shuffling for the rapid generation of novel [FeFe]-hydrogenase libraries.
AB  - A gene-shuffling technique was identified, optimized and used to generate diverse libraries of recombinant [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Six native [FeFe]-hydrogenase genes from species of Clostridia were first cloned and separately expressed in Escherichia coli concomitantly with the assembly proteins required for [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation. All enzymes, with the exception of C. thermocellum HydA, exhibited significant activity when expressed. Single-stranded DNA fragments from genes encoding the two most active [FeFe]-hydrogenases were used to optimize a gene-shuffling protocol and generate recombinant enzyme libraries. Random sampling demonstrates that several shuffled products are active. This represents the first successful application of gene-shuffling using hydrogenases. Moreover, we demonstrate that a single set of [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation proteins is sufficient for the heterologous assembly of the bioinorganic active site of several native and shuffled [FeFe]-hydrogenases.
TI  - [Obtaining of ScFv-CBD fusion protein and its application for affinity purification of recombinant human interferon alpha2b].
AB  - The gene of ScFv-CBD-fusion protein has been designed using the DNA sequences encoding of single-chain antibody (ScFv) against human interferon alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) and cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. Biosynthesis of ScFv-CBD utilizing high-productive Escherichia coli system was carried out and the accumulation of target protein in bacterial inclusion bodies was shown. After the purification of the inclusion bodies and their subsequent in vitro refolding the soluble ScFv-CBD-fusion protein was directly immobilized on cellulose by bioaffinity coupling. The possibility to obtain the preparative quantities of ScFv-CBD in biologically-active form using different refolding schemes was accurately investigated in the paper. The general applicability of biologically immobilized ScFv-CBD-fusion proteins for affinity purification of recombinant IFN-alpha2b is shown.
TI  - Different binding specificities of S-layer homology modules from Clostridium thermocellum AncA, Slp1, and Slp2.
AB  - S-layer homology (SLH) module polypeptides were derived from Clostridium thermocellum S-layer proteins Slp1 and Slp2 and cellulosome anchoring protein AncA as rSlp1-SLH, rSlp2-SLH, and rAncA-SLH respectively. Their binding specificities were investigated using C. thermocellum cell-wall preparations. rAncA-SLH associated with native peptidoglycan-containing sacculi from C. thermocellum, including both peptidoglycan and secondary cell wall polymers (SCWP), but not to hydrofluoric acid-extracted peptidoglycan-containing sacculi (HF-EPCS) lacking SCWPs, suggesting that SCWPs are responsible for binding with SLH modules of AncA. On the other hand, rSlp1-SLH and rSlp2-SLH associated with HF-EPCS, suggesting that these polypeptides had an affinity for peptidoglycan. A binding assay using a peptidoglycan fraction prepared from Escherichia coli cells definitely confirmed that rSlp1-SLH and rSlp2-SLH specifically interacted with peptidoglycan but not with SCWP.
TI  - Characterization of an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - A gene encoding an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Clostridium thermocellum, Ct1,3Gal43A, was isolated. The sequence has similarity with an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pc1,3Gal43A). The gene encodes a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) module, a family 13 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM13), and a C-terminal dockerin domain. The gene corresponding to the GH43 module was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product was characterized. The recombinant enzyme shows optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 50 degrees C and catalyzes hydrolysis only of beta-1,3-linked galactosyl oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the hydrolysis products demonstrated that the enzyme produces galactose from beta-1,3-galactan in an exo-acting manner. When the enzyme acted on arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), the enzyme produced oligosaccharides together with galactose, suggesting that the enzyme is able to accommodate a beta-1,6-linked galactosyl side chain. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is very similar to that of Pc1,3Gal43A, suggesting that the enzyme is an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase. Affinity gel electrophoresis of the C-terminal CBM13 did not show any affinity for polysaccharides, including beta-1,3-galactan. However, frontal affinity chromatography for the CBM13 indicated that the CBM13 specifically interacts with oligosaccharides containing a beta-1,3-galactobiose, beta-1,4-galactosyl glucose, or beta-1,4-galactosyl N-acetylglucosaminide moiety at the nonreducing end. Interestingly, CBM13 in the C terminus of Ct1,3Gal43A appeared to interfere with the enzyme activity toward beta-1,3-galactan and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase-treated AGP.
TI  - Overexpression, purification and crystallization of the two C-terminal domains of the bifunctional cellulase ctCel9D-Cel44A from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum produces a highly organized multi-enzyme complex of cellulases and hemicellulases for the hydrolysis of plant cell-wall polysaccharides, which is termed the cellulosome. The bifunctional multi-modular cellulase ctCel9D-Cel44A is one of the largest components of the C. thermocellum cellulosome. The enzyme contains two internal catalytic domains belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 9 and 44. The C-terminus of this cellulase, comprising a polycystic kidney-disease module (PKD) and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM44), has been crystallized. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P4(3)2(1)2, containing a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. Native and seleno-L-methionine-derivative crystals diffracted to 2.1 and 2.8 A, respectively.
TI  - Structure and activity of two metal ion-dependent acetylxylan esterases involved  in plant cell wall degradation reveals a close similarity to peptidoglycan deacetylases.
AB  - The enzymatic degradation of plant cell wall xylan requires the concerted action  of a diverse enzymatic syndicate. Among these enzymes are xylan esterases, which hydrolyze the O-acetyl substituents, primarily at the O-2 position of the xylan backbone. All acetylxylan esterase structures described previously display a alpha/beta hydrolase fold with a "Ser-His-Asp" catalytic triad. Here we report the structures of two distinct acetylxylan esterases, those from Streptomyces lividans and Clostridium thermocellum, in native and complex forms, with x-ray data to between 1.6 and 1.0 A resolution. We show, using a novel linked assay system with PNP-2-O-acetylxyloside and a beta-xylosidase, that the enzymes are sugar-specific and metal ion-dependent and possess a single metal center with a chemical preference for Co2+. Asp and His side chains complete the catalytic machinery. Different metal ion preferences for the two enzymes may reflect the surprising diversity with which the metal ion coordinates residues and ligands in the active center environment of the S. lividans and C. thermocellum enzymes. These "CE4" esterases involved in plant cell wall degradation are shown to be closely related to the de-N-acetylases involved in chitin and peptidoglycan degradation (Blair, D. E., Schuettelkopf, A. W., MacRae, J. I., and Aalten, D. M. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 102, 15429-15434), which form the NodB deacetylase "superfamily."
TI  - Improving solubility of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Clostridium thermocellum JW-20 proteins expressed into Esherichia coli.
AB  - Low solubility of proteins overexpressed in E. coli is a frequent problem in high-throughput structural genomics. To improve solubility of proteins from mesophilic Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and thermophilic Clostridium thermocellum JW20, an approach was attempted that included a fusion of the target protein to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a decrease of induction temperature. The MBP was selected as the most efficient solubilizing carrier when compared to a glutathione S-transferase and a Nus A protein. A tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site was introduced between fused proteins using a double polymerase-chain reaction and four primers. In this way, 79 S. oneidensis proteins have been expressed in one case with an N-terminal 30-residue tag and in another case as a fusion protein with MBP. A foreign tag might significantly affect the properties of the target polypeptide. At 37 degrees C and 18 degrees C induction temperatures, only 5 and 17 tagged proteins were soluble, respectively. In fusion with MBP 4, 34, and 38 proteins were soluble upon induction at 37 degrees, 28 degrees, and 18 degrees C, respectively. The MBP is assumed to increase stability and solubility of a target protein by changing both the mechanism and the cooperativity of folding/unfolding. The 66 C. thermocellum proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with MBP. Induction at 37 degrees, 28 degrees, and 18 degrees C produced 34, 57, and 60 soluble proteins, respectively. The higher solubility of C. thermocellum proteins in comparison with the S. oneidensis proteins under similar conditions of induction correlates with the thermophilicity of the host. The two-factor Wilkinson-Harrison statistical model was used to identify soluble and insoluble proteins. Theoretical and experimental data showed good agreement for S. oneidensis proteins; however, the model failed to identify soluble/insoluble Clostridium proteins. A suggestion has been made that the Wilkinson-Harrison model is not applicable to C. thermocellum proteins because it did not account for the peculiarities of protein sequences from thermophiles.
TI  - Role of spontaneous current oscillations during high-efficiency electrotransformation of thermophilic anaerobes.
AB  - Current oscillations at about 24 MHz were observed during electrotransformation (ET) of the thermophilic anaerobes Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405, C. thermocellum DSM 1313, and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum YS 485, using a pulse gated by a square signal generated by a custom generator. In experiments in which only the field strength was varied, all three of these strains resulted in a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of current oscillations and successful ET. Oscillations accompanied ET of both C. thermocellum strains only at field strengths of > or =12 kV/cm, and ET was only observed above the same threshold. Similarly, for T. saccharolyticum, oscillations were only observed at field strengths of > or =10 kV/cm, and ET was only observed above the same threshold. When a passive electrical filter consisting of an inductor and resistor in parallel was added to the system to prevent the development of oscillations, ET efficiencies were reduced dramatically for all three strains at all field strengths tested. The maximum tested field strength, 25 kV/cm, resulted in the maximum measured transformation efficiency for all three strains. At this field strength, the efficiency of ET in the absence of oscillations was decreased compared to that observed in the presence of oscillations by 500-fold for C. thermocellum ATCC 27405, 2,500-fold for C. thermocellum DSM 1313, and 280-fold for T. saccharolyticum. Controls using the same apparatus with Escherichia coli cells or a resistor with a value representative of the direct current resistance of typical cell samples did not develop oscillations, and ET efficiencies obtained with E. coli were the same with or without the electrical filter included in the pulse generator circuit. The results are interpreted to indicate that spontaneously arising oscillations have a large beneficial effect on transformation efficiency in the system employed here and that the development of oscillations in this system is affected by the cell species present.
TI  - Xyloglucan is recognized by carbohydrate-binding modules that interact with beta-glucan chains.
AB  - Enzyme systems that attack the plant cell wall contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that mediate attachment to this composite structure and play a pivotal role in maximizing the hydrolytic process. Although xyloglucan, which includes a backbone of beta-1,4-glucan decorated primarily with xylose residues, is a key component of the plant cell wall, CBMs that bind to this polymer have not been identified. Here we showed that the C-terminal domain of the modular Clostridium thermocellum enzyme CtCel9D-Cel44A (formerly known as CelJ) comprises a novel CBM (designated CBM44) that binds with equal affinity to cellulose and xyloglucan. We also showed that accommodation of xyloglucan side chains is a general feature of CBMs that bind to single cellulose chains. The crystal structures of CBM44 and the other CBM (CBM30) in CtCel9D-Cel44A display a beta-sandwich fold. The concave face of both CBMs contains a hydrophobic platform comprising three tryptophan residues that can accommodate up to five glucose residues. The orientation of these aromatic residues is such that the bound ligand would adopt the twisted conformation displayed by cello-oligosaccharides in solution. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that the hydrophobic platform located on the concave face of both CBMs mediates ligand recognition. In contrast to other CBMs that bind to single polysaccharide chains, the polar residues in the binding cleft of CBM44 play only a minor role in ligand recognition. The mechanism by which these proteins are able to recognize linear and decorated beta-1,4-glucans is discussed based on the structures of CBM44 and the other CBMs that bind single cellulose chains.
TI  - Binding of S-layer homology modules from Clostridium thermocellum SdbA to peptidoglycans.
AB  - S-layer homology (SLH) module polypeptides were derived from Clostridium josui xylanase Xyn10A, Clostridium stercorarium xylanase Xyn10B, and Clostridium thermocellum scafoldin dockerin binding protein SdbA as rXyn10A-SLH, rXyn10B-SLH, and rSdbA-SLH, respectively. Their binding specificities were investigated using various cell wall preparations. rXyn10A-SLH and rXyn10B-SLH bound to native peptidoglycan-containing sacculi consisting of peptidoglycan and secondary cell wall polymers (SCWP) prepared from these bacteria but not to hydrofluoric acid-extracted peptidoglycan-containing sacculi (HF-EPCS) lacking SCWP, suggesting that SCWP are responsible for binding with SLH modules. In contrast, rSdbA-SLH interacted with HF-EPCS, suggesting that this polypeptide had an affinity for peptidoglycans but not for SCWP. The affinity of rSdbA-SLH for peptidoglycans was confirmed by a binding assay using a peptidoglycan fraction prepared from Escherichia coli cells. The SLH modules of SdbA must be useful for cell surface engineering in bacteria that do not contain SCWP.
TI  - How family 26 glycoside hydrolases orchestrate catalysis on different polysaccharides: structure and activity of a Clostridium thermocellum lichenase, CtLic26A.
AB  - One of the most intriguing features of the 90 glycoside hydrolase families (GHs)  is the range of specificities displayed by different members of the same family, whereas the catalytic apparatus and mechanism are often invariant. Family GH26 predominantly comprises beta-1,4 mannanases; however, a bifunctional Clostridium thermocellum GH26 member (hereafter CtLic26A) displays a markedly different specificity. We show that CtLic26A is a lichenase, specific for mixed (Glcbeta1,4Glcbeta1,4Glcbeta1,3)n oligo- and polysaccharides, and displays no activity on manno-configured substrates or beta-1,4-linked homopolymers of glucose or xylose. The three-dimensional structure of the native form of CtLic26A has been solved at 1.50-A resolution, revealing a characteristic (beta/alpha)8 barrel with Glu-109 and Glu-222 acting as the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile in a double-displacement mechanism. The complex with the competitive inhibitor, Glc-beta-1,3-isofagomine (Ki 1 microm), at 1.60 A sheds light on substrate recognition in the -2 and -1 subsites and illuminates why the enzyme is specific for lichenan-based substrates. Hydrolysis of beta-mannosides by GH26 members is thought to proceed through transition states in the B2,5 (boat) conformation in which structural distinction of glucosides versus mannosides reflects not the configuration at C2 but the recognition of the pseudoaxial O3 of the B2,5 conformation. We suggest a different conformational itinerary for the GH26 enzymes active on gluco-configured substrates.
TI  - [Comparative study of the expression of the native and modified cry3a genes of Bacillus thuringiensis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells].
AB  - The cry3a gene of Bacillus thuriengiensis was cloned. Based on sequence analysis  of this gene, a modified gene, cry3aM, was constructed, which has the optimal codon composition for effective expression in eukaryotic cells. Hybrid genes cry3a-licBM2 and cry3aM-licBM2 were constructed, in which the sequences of the native and modified genes are fusedfused with the reorter gene for thermostable lichenase in the reading frame. We have shown that the expression levels of hybrid genes cry3a-licBM2 and cry3aM-licBM2 in Escherichia coli are comparable, being 5% of those for reporter gene licBM2. In cells of a lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of hybrid gene cry3aM-licBM2? Which contains the modified gene, considerably exceeded the level of expression of cry3a-licBM2 containing the native gene. The presence of lichenase in the composition of hybrid proteins was shown to facilitate selection and analysis of the expression level of hybrid proteins in transgenic organisms.
TI  - Functions of family-22 carbohydrate-binding module in Clostridium thermocellum Xyn10C.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum xylanase Xyn10C (formerly XynC) is a modular enzyme, comprising a family-22 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), a family-10 catalytic module of the glycoside hydrolases, and a dockerin module responsible for cellulosome assembly consecutively from the N-terminus. To study the functions of the CBM, truncated derivatives of Xyn10C were constructed: a recombinant catalytic module polypeptide (rCM), a family-22 CBM polypeptide (rCBM), and a polypeptide composed of the family-22 CBM and CM (rCBM-CM). The recombinant proteins were characterized by enzyme and binding assays. Although the catalytic activity of rCBM-CM toward insoluble xylan was four times higher than that of rCM toward the same substrate, removal of the CBM did not severely affect catalytic activity toward soluble xylan or beta-1,3-1,4-glucan. rCBM showed an affinity for amorphous celluloses and insoluble and soluble xylan in qualitative binding assays. The optimum temperature of rCBM-CM was 80 degrees C and that of rCM was 60 degrees C. These results indicate that the family-22 CBM of C. thermocellum Xyn10C not only was responsible for the binding of the enzyme to the substrates, but also contributes to the stability of the CM in the presence of the substrate at high temperatures.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Clostridium thermocellum L-lactate dehydrogenase gene in Escherichia coli and enzyme characterization.
AB  - The structural gene for L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (EC.1.1.1.27) from Clostridium thermocellum 27405 was cloned in Escherichia coli by screening the Lambda Zap II phage library of C. thermocellum genomic DNA. In one positive clone, an open reading frame of 948 base pairs corresponded to C. thermocellum ldh gene encoding for the predicted 315-residue protein. The ldh gene was successfully expressed in E. coli FMJ39 (ldh mutant) under the lac promoter. The recombinant enzyme was partially purified from E. coli cell extracts and its kinetic properties were determined. Clostridium thermocellum LDH was shown to catalyze a highly reversible reaction and to be an allosteric enzyme that is activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP). For pyruvate, partially purified LDH had Km and Vmax values of 7.3 mmol/L and 87 micromol/min, respectively, and in the presence of FDP, a 24-fold decrease in Km and a 5.7-fold increase in Vmax were recorded. The enzyme exhibited no marked catalytic activity for lactate in the absence of FDP, whereas Km and Vmax values were 59.5 mmol/L and 52 micromol/min, respectively, in its presence. The enzyme did not lose activity when incubated at 65 degrees C for 5 min.
TI  - Expression, purification and structural characterization of the scaffoldin hydrophilic X-module from the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The cellulosome is a membrane-bound, extracellular multi-subunit complex responsible for the degradation of crystalline cellulose by a number of organisms including anaerobic bacteria and fungi. The hydrophilic X-module (CipA-X) from the modular scaffoldin subunit of Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome has been proposed to play various roles in cellulosomal function, including thermal and structural stability. Towards elucidating the function of CipA-X using structural and biophysical studies, the region comprising residues 1692-1785 from the C. thermocellum CipA cDNA encoding CipA-X was cloned into a pET21b expression vector. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the C-terminal His-tagged protein accumulated in the insoluble fraction. Cell fractionation experiments showed that the recombinant protein was localized to inclusion bodies. Refolding and purification involved denaturation of the whole cell lysate by addition of urea, followed by a nickel-Sepharose chromatography step and dialysis into native conditions (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EDTA). A final gel filtration step purified the protein to homogeneity, yielding 40 mg/L. The two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectrum of uniformly 15N-labelled CipA-X showed the characteristics of a well-folded protein comprising significant beta-structure, which is in agreement with the circular dichroism data.
TI  - Protein splicing and auto-cleavage of bacterial intein-like domains lacking a C'-flanking nucleophilic residue.
AB  - Bacterial intein-like (BIL) domains are newly identified homologs of intein protein-splicing domains. The two known types of BIL domains together with inteins and hedgehog (Hog) auto-processing domains form the Hog/intein (HINT) superfamily. BIL domains are distinct from inteins and Hogs in sequence, phylogenetic distribution, and host protein type, but little is known about their biochemical activity. Here we experimentally study the auto-processing activity of four BIL domains. An A-type BIL domain from Clostridium thermocellum showed both protein-splicing and auto-cleavage activities. The splicing is notable, because this domain has a native Ala C'-flanking residue rather than a nucleophilic residue, which is absolutely necessary for intein protein splicing. B-type BIL domains from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus cleaved their N' or C' ends. We propose an alternative protein-splicing mechanism for the A-type BIL domains. After an initial N-S acyl shift, creating a thioester bond at the N' end of the domain, the C' end of the domain is cleaved by Asn cyclization. The resulting amino end of the C'-flank attacks the thioester bond next at the N' end of the domain. This aminolysis step splices the two flanks of the domain. The B-type BIL domain cleavage activity is explained in the context of the canonical intein protein-splicing mechanism. Our results suggest that the different HINT domains have related biochemical activities of proteolytic cleavages, ligation and splicing. Yet the predominant reactions diverged in each HINT type according to their specific biological roles. We suggest that the BIL domain cleavage and splicing reactions are mechanisms for post-translationally generating protein variability, particularly in extracellular bacterial proteins.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Electrotransformation of several strains of Clostridium thermocellum was achieved using plasmid pIKm1 with selection based on resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin. A custom-built pulse generator was used to apply a square 10-ms pulse to an electrotransformation cuvette consisting of a modified centrifuge tube. Transformation was verified by recovery of the shuttle plasmid pIKm1 from presumptive transformants of C. thermocellum with subsequent PCR specific to the mls gene on the plasmid, as well as by retransformation of Escherichia coli. Optimization carried out with strain DSM 1313 increased transformation efficiencies from <1 to (2.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(5) transformants per micro g of plasmid DNA. Factors conducive to achieving high transformation efficiencies included optimized periods of incubation both before and after electric pulse application, chilling during cell collection and washing, subculture in the presence of isoniacin prior to electric pulse application, a custom-built cuvette embedded in an ice block during pulse application, use of a high (25-kV/cm) field strength, and induction of the mls gene before plating the cells on selective medium. The protocol and preferred conditions developed for strain DSM 1313 resulted in transformation efficiencies of (5.0 +/- 1.8) x 10(4) transformants per micro g of plasmid DNA for strain ATCC 27405 and approximately 1 x 10(3) transformants per micro g of plasmid DNA for strains DSM 4150 and 7072. Cell viability under optimal conditions was approximately 50% of that of controls not exposed to an electrical pulse. Dam methylation had a beneficial but modest (7-fold for strain ATCC 27405; 40-fold for strain DSM 1313) effect on transformation efficiency. The effect of isoniacin was also strain specific. The results reported here provide for the first time a gene transfer method functional in C. thermocellum that is suitable for molecular manipulations involving either the introduction of genes associated with foreign gene products or knockout of native genes.
TI  - Cohesin-dockerin interactions within and between Clostridium josui and Clostridium thermocellum: binding selectivity between cognate dockerin and cohesin domains and species specificity.
AB  - The cellulosome components are assembled into the cellulosome complex by the interaction between one of the repeated cohesin domains of a scaffolding protein and the dockerin domain of an enzyme component. We prepared five recombinant cohesin polypeptides of the Clostridium thermocellum scaffolding protein CipA, two dockerin polypeptides of C. thermocellum Xyn11A and Xyn10C, four cohesin polypeptides of Clostridium josui CipA, and two dockerin polypeptides of C. josui Aga27A and Cel8A, and qualitatively and quantitatively examined the cohesin-dockerin interactions within C. thermocellum and C. josui, respectively, and the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interactions between these two bacteria. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis indicated that there was a certain selectivity, with a maximal 34-fold difference in the K(D) values, in the cohesin-dockerin interactions within a combination of C. josui, although this was not detected by qualitative analysis. Affinity blotting analysis suggested that there was at least one exception to the species specificity in the cohesin-dockerin interactions, although species specificity was generally conserved among the cohesin and dockerin polypeptides from C. thermocellum and C. josui, i.e. the dockerin polypeptides of C. thermocellum Xyn11A exceptionally bound to the cohesin polypeptides from C. josui CipA. SPR analysis confirmed this exceptional binding. We discuss the relationship between the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin binding and the conserved amino acid residues in the dockerin domains.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and cell surface localization of Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 5, a multidomain xylanase.
AB  - We have shown that a xylan-degrading bacterium, W-61, excretes multiple xylanases, including xylanase 5 with a molecular mass of 140 kDa. Here, we emend the previously used classification of the bacterium (i.e., Aeromonas caviae W-61) to Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, and we clone and express the xyn5 gene encoding xylanase 5 (Xyn5) in Escherichia coli and study the subcellular localization of Xyn5. xyn5 encodes 1,326 amino acid residues, including a 27-amino-acid signal sequence. Sequence analysis indicated that Xyn5 comprises two family 22 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases, a family 9 CBM, a domain similar to the lysine-rich region of Clostridium thermocellum SdbA, and three S-layer-homologous (SLH) domains. Recombinant Xyn5 bound to a crystalline cellulose, Avicel PH-101, while an N-terminal 90-kDa fragment of Xyn5, which lacks the C-terminal half of the family 9 CBM, did not bind to Avicel PH-101. Xyn5 was cell bound, and the cell-bound protein was digested by exogenous trypsin to produce immunoreactive and xylanolytic fragments with molecular masses of 80 and 60 kDa. Xyn5 was exclusively distributed in the cell envelope fraction consisting of a peptidoglycan-containing layer and an associated S layer. Thus, Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 Xyn5 is a cell surface-anchored modular xylanase possessing a functional cellulose-binding module and SLH domains. Possible cooperative action of multiple xylanases produced by strain W-61 is discussed on the basis of the modular structure of Xyn5.
TI  - [Bifunctional reporter genes: construction and expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells].
AB  - Bifunctional reporter proteins were constructed to combine Clostridium thermocellum lichenase (LicBM2) with Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) or with Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS). The major properties of the initial proteins were preserved in the hybrid ones: LicBM2 was active at 65 degrees C, GFP fluoresced, and GUS hydrolyzed its substrates. LicBM2 remained active after extension of its C of N end. Bifunctional reporter systems were shown to provide a convenient tool for studying the gene expression regulation in prokaryotic (E. coli) and eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammalian) cells, advantages of one reporter compensating for drawbacks of the other.
TI  - Lic16A of Clostridium thermocellum, a non-cellulosomal, highly complex endo-beta-1,3-glucanase bound to the outer cell surface.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum produces one major beta-1,3-glucanase. Genomic DNA fragments containing the gene were cloned from two strains, DSM1237(T) (6848 bp) and F7 (9766 bp). Overlapping sequences were 99.9 % identical. The nucleotide sequences contained reading frames for a putative transposase, endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase CelC, a putative transcription regulator of the LacI type, beta-1,3-glucanase Lic16A and a putative membrane protein. The licA genes of both strains encoded an identical protein of 1324 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 148 kDa. Lic16A is an unusually complex protein consisting of a leader peptide, a threefold repeat of an S-layer homologous module (SLH), an unknown module, a catalytic module of glycosyl hydrolase family 16 and a fourfold repeat of a carbohydrate-binding module of family CBM4a. The recombinant Lic16A protein was characterized as an endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase with a specific activity of 2680 and 340 U mg(-1) and a K(m) of 0.94 and 2.1 mg ml(-1) towards barley beta-glucan and laminarin, respectively. It was specific for beta-glucans containing beta-1,3-linkages with an optimum temperature of 70 degrees C at pH 6.0. The N-terminal SLH modules were cleaved from the protein as well in Escherichia coli as in C. thermocellum, but nevertheless bound tightly to the rest of the protein. Lic16A was located on the cell surface from which it could be purified after fractionated solubilization. Its inducible production allowed C. thermocellum to grow on beta-1,3- or beta-1,3-1,4-glucan.
TI  - Isolation of fusion proteins containing SecY and SecE, components of the protein  translocation complex from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii.
AB  - By exploiting the salt-insensitive interaction of the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome with cellulose, purification of CBD-fused versions of SecY and SecE, components of the translocation apparatus of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii, was undertaken. Following transformation of Haloferax volcanii cells with CBD-SecY- or -SecE-encoding plasmids, cellulose-based purification led to the capture of stably expressed, membrane-bound 68 and 25 kDa proteins, respectively. Both fusion proteins were recognized by antibodies raised against the CBD. Thus, CBD-cellulose interactions can be employed as a salt-insensitive affinity purification system for the capture of complexes containing the Haloferax volcanii translocation apparatus components SecY and SecE.
TI  - [A thermostable Clostridium thermocellum lichenase-based reporter system for studying the gene expression regulation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells].
AB  - A new reporter system was developed to study the gene expression regulation in prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian) cells. The system was based on the modified bacterial lichenase gene (licBM2), which was shown to meet the requirements for a reporter. The gene product was active and did not undergo modification in heterologous hosts. Simple and sensitive methods were used to detect and to quantitate the lichenase activity. Inducible licBM2 expression was demonstrated with E. coli and yeast cells, allowing the system to be employed in dynamic studies.
TI  - Clostridium thermocellum cellulase CelT, a family 9 endoglucanase without an Ig-like domain or family 3c carbohydrate-binding module.
AB  - The celT gene of Clostridium thermocellum strain F1 was found downstream of the mannanase gene man26B [Kurokawa J et al. (2001) Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 65:548-554] in pKS305. The open reading frame of celT consists of 1,833 nucleotides encoding a protein of 611 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 68,510. The mature form of CelT consists of a family 9 cellulase domain and a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly, but lacks a family 3c carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, which are often found with family 9 catalytic domains. CelT devoid of the dockerin domain (CelTDeltadoc) was constructed and purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli, and its enzyme properties were examined. CelTDeltadoc showed strong activity toward carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and barley beta-glucan, and low activity toward xylan. The V(max) and K(m) values were 137 micro mol min(-1) mg(-1) and 16.7 mg/ml, respectively, for CMC. Immunological analysis indicated that CelT is a catalytic component of the C. thermocellum F1 cellulosome. This is the first report describing the characterization of a family 9 cellulase without an Ig-like domain or family 3c CBM.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - Kinetic studies of a recombinant cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP) of the Clostridium thermocellum YM4 strain expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP) cloned from the Clostridium thermocellum YM4 strain was purified to homogeneity, and the reaction mechanisms of both the phosphorolytic and synthetic reactions were studied in detail. The enzyme reaction proceeded via an ordered bi bi mechanism, in which P(i) bound to the enzyme prior to D-cellobiose and then G 1-P was released after D-glucose. The order of substrate binding was different from that of CBP from Cellvibrio gilvus, which bound to cellobiose prior to P(i). In the synthetic reaction, the enzyme showed three times higher activity with beta-D-glucose than with alpha-D-glucose, and also showed weak activity with 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, indicating that the beta-anomeric hydroxyl group of D-glucose is highly required. However, even when it is removed enzyme activity remains. The substrate specificity and kinetic studies revealed that the configurations of the C3 and C4 hydroxyl groups were strictly required for the enzyme activity, whereas those of C2 and C6 could be substituted or deleted. The mechanism of substrate inhibition by D-glucose was studied in detail and it was concluded that D-glucose competed with G 1-P for its binding site in the synthetic reaction.
TI  - A reporter system for prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on the thermostable  lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The coding region of the licB gene from Clostridium thermocellum was truncated at the 3' end. The modified lichenase encoded by the construct (LicBM2) retained the most important properties of the enzyme - its high activity and thermostability. LicBM2 consists of the catalytic domain and part of the Pro-Thr-box. We demonstrated the application of the licBM2 gene as a reporter system for prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian) cells by expressing it either as a transcriptional fusion with selected promoters or as a translational fusion with the E. coli uidA gene. The assays available for LicB activity are sensitive, accurate and simple, and can be used for the analysis of various gene fusion systems or for screening of transformants.
TI  - New E. coli cloning vector using a cellulase gene (celA) as a screening marker.
AB  - The extracellular endoglucanase A gene of Clostridium thermocellum (celA) was used as a screening marker for E. coli cloning vector A 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment containing celA from pTvec/celA was isolated and cloned into a pUC18 deleting beta-galactosidase gene fragment. The constructed vectors, pCEL1, pCEL10, pCEL11, and pCEL20, have different multiple cloning sites within celA. If the cellulase, CelA, is inactivated by insertion of a foreign DNA fragment into multiple cloning sites, the recombinant transformants show no clear halos on an agar plate containing cellulose. This process overcomes the ambiguity of color screening in the X-gal/beta-galactosidase system, and over 90% of the recombinant transformants with no halos have foreign DNA inserts. Several E. coli strains were transformed successfully with pCEL series vectors regardless of mutation for alpha-complementation. Because E. coli strains do not have a cellulase gene, a vector using a cellulase gene screening marker can be used in any E. coli strain without limit. The new cloning system is very efficient, convenient, and cost effective.
TI  - Do domain interactions of glycosyl hydrolases from Clostridium thermocellum contribute to protein thermostability?
AB  - Cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes usually have a domain composition. The  mutual influence of a cellulose-binding domain and a catalytic domain was investigated with cellobiohydrolase CelK and xylanase XynZ from Clostridium thermocellum. CelK is composed of an N-terminal family IV cellulose-binding domain (CBDIV(CelK)), a family 9 glycosyl hydrolase domain (Gh9(CelK)) and a dockerin domain (DD). CelK without the DD, (CBDIV-Gh9)(CelK) and CBDIV(CelK) bound cellulose. The thermostability of (CBDIV-Gh9)(CelK) was significantly higher than that of CBDIV(CelK) and Gh9(CelK). The temperature optima of (CBDIV-Gh9)(CelK) and Gh9(CelK) were 65 and 45 degrees C, respectively. XynZ consists of an N-terminal feruloyl esterase domain (FAE(XynZ)), a linker (L), a family VI CBD (CBDVI(XynZ)), a DD and a xylanase domain. FAE(XynZ) and (FAE-L-CBDVI)(XynZ), used in the present study did not bind cellulose, but both were highly thermostable. Replacement of CBDVI(XynZ) with CBDIV(CelK) resulted in chimeras with feruloyl esterase activity and the ability to bind cellulose. CBDIV(CelK)-FAE(XynZ) bound cellulose with parameters similar to that of (CBDIV-Gh9)(CelK). (FAE-L)(XynZ)-CBDIV(CelK) and FAE(XynZ)-CBDIV(CelK) had lower relative affinities and binding capacities than those of (CBDIV-Gh9)(CelK). The three chimeras were much less thermostable than FAE(XynZ) and (FAE-L-CBDVI)(XynZ). The results indicate that domains of glycosyl hydrolases are not randomly combined and that domain interactions affect properties of these domain-structured enzymes.
TI  - Sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum mannanase gene man26B and characterization of the translated product.
AB  - The man26B gene of Clostridium thermocellum strain F1 was found in pKS305, which  had been selected as a recombinant plasmid conferring endoglucanase activity on Escherichia coli. The open reading frame of man26B consists of 1,773 nucleotides encoding a protein of 591 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 67,047. Man26B is a modular enzyme composed of an N-terminal signal peptide and three domains in the following order: a mannan-binding domain, a family 26 mannanase domain, and a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly. We found that this gene was a homologue of the man26A gene of C. thermocellum strain YS but that there were insertion or deletion mutations that caused a frame-shift mutation affecting a stretch of 26 amino acids in the catalytic domain. Man26B devoid of the dockerin domain was constructed and purified from a recombinant E. coli, and its enzyme properties were examined. Immunological analysis indicated that Man26B was a catalytic component of the C. thermocellum F1 cellulosome.
TI  - Properties and mutation analysis of the CelK cellulose-binding domain from the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - The family IV cellulose-binding domain of Clostridium thermocellum CelK (CBD(CelK)) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. It binds to acid-swollen cellulose (ASC) and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) with capacities of 16.03 and 3.95 micromol/g of cellulose and relative affinities (K(r)) of 2.33 and 9.87 liters/g, respectively. The CBD(CelK) is the first representative of family IV CBDs to exhibit an affinity for BMCC. The CBD(CelK) also binds to the soluble polysaccharides lichenin, glucomannan, and barley beta-glucan, which are substrates for CelK. It does not bind to xylan, galactomannan, and carboxymethyl cellulose. The CBD(CelK) contains 1 mol of calcium per mol. The CBD(CelK) has three thiol groups and one disulfide, reduction of which results in total loss of cellulose-binding ability. To reveal amino acid residues important for biological function of the domain and to investigate the role of calcium in the CBD(CelK) four highly conserved aromatic residues (Trp(56), Trp(94), Tyr(111), and Tyr(136)) and Asp(192) were mutated into alanines, giving the mutants W56A, W94A, Y111A, Y136A, and D192A. In addition 14 N-terminal amino acids were deleted, giving the CBD-N(CelK). The CBD-N(CelK) and D192A retained binding parameters close to that of the intact CBD(CelK), W56A and W94A totally lost the ability to bind to cellulose, Y136A bound to both ASC and BMCC but with significantly reduced binding capacity and K(r) and Y111A bound weakly to ASC and did not bind to BMCC. Mutations of the aromatic residues in the CBD(CelK) led to structural changes revealed by studying solubility, circular-dichroism spectra, dimer formation, and aggregation. Calcium content was drastically decreased in D192A. The results suggest that Asp192 is in the calcium-binding site of the CBD(CelK) and that calcium does not affect binding to cellulose. The 14 amino acids from the N terminus of the CBD(CelK) are not important for binding. Tyr136, corresponding to Cellulomonas fimi CenC CBD(N1) Y85, located near the binding cleft, might be involved in the formation of the binding surface, while Y111, W56A, and W94A are essential for the binding process by keeping the CBD(CelK) correctly folded.
TI  - Advances in development of a genetic system for Thermoanaerobacterium spp.: expression of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, development of a second shuttle vector, and integration of genes into the chromosome.
AB  - Despite recent success in transforming various thermophilic gram-type-positive anaerobes with plasmid DNA, use of shuttle vectors for the expression of genes other than antibiotic resistance markers has not previously been described. We constructed new vectors in order to express heterologous hydrolytic enzymes in our model system, Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum JW/SL-YS485. Transformed Thermoanaerobacterium expressed active enzyme, indicating that this system may function as an alternate expression host, especially for genes with a thermophilic origin. To develop further the genetic system for T. saccharolyticum JW/SL-YS485, two improved Escherichia coli-Thermoanaerobacterium shuttle vectors, pRKM1 and pRUKM, were constructed. Furthermore, the kanamycin resistance cassette alone and the kanamycin resistance cassette plus the cellobiohydrolase gene (cbhA) from Clostridium thermocellum JW20 were integrated into the xylanase gene (xynA) region of the Thermoanaerobacterium chromosome via homologous recombination using pUC-based suicide vectors pUXK and pUXKC.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome xylanase Z feruloyl esterase domain.
AB  - Feruloyl esterases cleave ferulic acid from arabinoxylan and pectin. Feruloyl groups are believed to crosslink the polysaccharide chain within the polymer and to link hemicellulose to lignin, which may play a role in controlling the growth of plants. The Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome xylanase Z feruloyl esterase was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystals diffract to 2.4 A resolution and belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 43.14, b = 63.77, c = 79.57 A. Assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient is calculated to be 1.87 A(3) Da(-1), which corresponds to a solvent content of 34%.
TI  - Feruloyl esterase activity of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome can be attributed to previously unknown domains of XynY and XynZ.
AB  - The cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum is a multiprotein complex with endo-  and exocellulase, xylanase, beta-glucanase, and acetyl xylan esterase activities. XynY and XynZ, components of the cellulosome, are composed of several domains including xylanase domains and domains of unknown function (UDs). Database searches revealed that the C- and N-terminal UDs of XynY and XynZ, respectively, have sequence homology with the sequence of a feruloyl esterase of strain PC-2 of the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces. Purified cellulosomes from C. thermocellum were found to hydrolyze FAXX (O-(5-O-[(E)-feruloyl]-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->3)-O-beta-D- xyl opyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-xylopyranose) and FAX(3) (5-O-[(E)-feruloyl]-[O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-O-alpha-L- arabinofuranosyl-[1-->3])-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-xylopyranose) , yielding ferulic acid as a product, indicating that they have feruloyl esterase activity. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the UDs of XynY and XynZ were cloned into Escherichia coli, and the expressed proteins hydrolyzed FAXX and FAX(3). The recombinant feruloyl esterase domain of XynZ alone (FAE(XynZ)) and with the adjacent cellulose binding domain (FAE-CBD(XynZ)) were characterized. FAE-CBD(XynZ) had a molecular mass of 45 kDa that corresponded to the expected product of the 1,203-bp gene. K(m) and V(max) values for FAX(3) were 5 mM and 12.5 U/mg, respectively, at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C. PAX(3), a substrate similar to FAX(3) but with a p-coumaroyl group instead of a feruloyl moiety was hydrolyzed at a rate 10 times slower. The recombinant enzyme was active between pH 3 to 10 with an optimum between pH 4 to 7 and at temperatures up to 70 degrees C. Treatment of Coastal Bermuda grass with the enzyme released mainly ferulic acid and a lower amount of p-coumaric acid. FAE(XynZ) had similar properties. Removal of the 40 C-terminal amino acids, residues 247 to 286, of FAE(XynZ) resulted in protein without activity. Feruloyl esterases are believed to aid in a release of lignin from hemicellulose and may be involved in lignin solubilization. The presence of feruloyl esterase in the C. thermocellum cellulosome together with its other hydrolytic activities demonstrates a powerful enzymatic potential of this organelle in plant cell wall decomposition.
TI  - Identification of the cellulose-binding domain of Fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase F.
AB  - The cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of Fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase F (EGF) has been determined. The gene encoding EGF (celF) and its derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli. We were able to obtain eight recombinant proteins and examine their cellulose-binding ability and endoglucanase activity. Because four recombinant proteins, which contain the first N-terminal reiterated region of EGF, bound to cellulose, the region has been identified as the CBD. Although the CBD did not show significant sequence similarity with any other CBDs, it did show significant similarity with a part of endoglucanase J (CelJ) of Clostridium thermocellum F1. Moreover, a large part of the C-terminal catalytic region of EGF showed sequence similarity with alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases of glycosyl hydrolase family 51.
TI  - A family 26 mannanase produced by Clostridium thermocellum as a component of the  cellulosome contains a domain which is conserved in mannanases from anaerobic fungi.
AB  - Cellulosomes prepared by the cellulose affinity digestion method from Clostridium thermocellum culture supernatant hydrolysed carob galactomannan during incubation at 60 degrees C and pH 6.5. A recombinant phage expressing mannanase activity was isolated from a library of C. thermocellum genomic DNA constructed in lambdaZAPII. The cloned fragment of DNA containing a putative mannanase gene (manA) was sequenced, revealing an ORF of 1767 nt, encoding a protein (mannanase A; Man26A) of 589 aa with a molecular mass of 66816 Da. The putative catalytic domain (CD) of Man26A, identified by gene sectioning and sequence comparisons, displayed up to 32% identity with other mannanases belonging to family 26. Immediately downstream of the CD and separated from it by a short proline/threonine linker was a duplicated 24-residue dockerin motif, which is conserved in all C. thermocellum cellulosomal enzymes described thus far and mediates their attachment to the cellulosome-integrating protein (CipA). Man26A consisting of the CD alone (Man26A") was hyperexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified. The truncated enzyme hydrolysed soluble and insoluble mannan, displaying a temperature optimum of 65 degrees C and a pH optimum of 6.5, but exhibited no activity against other plant cell wall polysaccharides. Antiserum raised against Man26A" cross-reacted with a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 70000 Da that is part of the C. thermocellum cellulosome. A second variant of Man26A containing the N-terminal segment of 130 residues and the CD (Man26A") bound to ivory-nut mannan and weakly to soluble Carob galactomannan and insoluble cellulose. Man26A" consisting of the CD alone did not bind to these polysaccharides. These results indicate that the N-terminal 130 residues of mature Man26A may constitute a weak mannan-binding domain. Sequence comparisons revealed a lack of identity between this region of Man26A and other polysaccharide-binding domains, but significant identity with a region conserved in the three family 26 mannanases from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi.
TI  - Phage display of a cellulose binding domain from Clostridium thermocellum and its application as a tool for antibody engineering.
AB  - Phage display of antibody fragments has proved to be a powerful tool for the isolation and in vitro evolution of these biologically important molecules. However, the general usefulness of this technology is still limited by some technical difficulties. One of the most debilitating obstacles to the widespread application of the technology is the accumulation of "insert loss" clones in the libraries; phagemid clones from which the DNA encoding part or all of the cloned antibody fragment had been deleted. Another difficulty arises when phage technology is applied for cloning hybridoma-derived antibody genes, where myeloma derived light chains, irrelevant to the hybridoma's antibody specificity may be fortuitously cloned. Here, we report the construction of a novel phage-display system designed to address these problems. In our system a single-chain Fv (scFv) is expressed as an in-frame fusion protein with a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) derived from the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The CBD domain serves as an affinity tag allowing rapid phage capture and concentration from crude culture supernatants, and immunological detection of both displaying phage and soluble scFv produced thereof. We demonstrate the utility of our system in solving the technical difficulties described above, and in speeding up the process of scFv isolation from combinatorial antibody repertoires.
TI  - Matrix-assisted refolding of single-chain Fv- cellulose binding domain fusion proteins.
AB  - We describe a method for the isolation of recombinant single-chain antibodies in  a biologically active form. The single-chain antibodies are fused to a cellulose binding domain as a single-chain protein that accumulates as insoluble inclusion bodies upon expression in Escherichia coli. The inclusion bodies are then solubilized and denatured by an appropriate chaotropic solvent, then reversibly immobilized onto a cellulose matrix via specific interaction of the matrix with the cellulose binding domain (CBD) moiety. The efficient immobilization that minimizes the contact between folding protein molecules, thus preventing their aggregation, is facilitated by the robustness of the Clostridium thermocellum CBD we use. This CBD is unique in retaining its specific cellulose binding capability when solubilized in up to 6 M urea, while the proteins fused to it are fully denatured. Refolding of the fusion proteins is induced by reducing with time the concentration of the denaturing solvent while in contact with the cellulose matrix. The refolded single-chain antibodies in their native state are then recovered by releasing them from the cellulose matrix in high yield of 60% or better, which is threefold or higher than the yield obtained by using published refolding protocols to recover the same scFvs. The described method should have general applicability for the production of many protein-CBD fusions in which the fusion partner is insoluble upon expression.
TI  - Characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2.
AB  - A 1,067-bp cDNA, designated axeA, coding for an acetyl xylan esterase (AxeA) was  cloned from the anaerobic rumen fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2. The gene had an open reading frame of 939 bp encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 34,845 Da. An active esterase using the original start codon of the cDNA was synthesized in Escherichia coli. Two active forms of the esterase were purified from recombinant E. coli cultures. The size difference of 8 amino acids was a result of cleavages at two different sites within the signal peptide. The enzyme released acetate from several acetylated substrates, including acetylated xylan. The activity toward acetylated xylan was tripled in the presence of recombinant xylanase A from the same fungus. Using p-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate, the enzyme had a K(m) of 0.9 mM and a V(max) of 785 micromol min(-1) mg(-1). It had temperature and pH optima of 30 degrees C and 9.0, respectively. AxeA had 56% amino acid identity with BnaA, an acetyl xylan esterase of Neocallimastix patriciarum, but the Orpinomyces AxeA was devoid of a noncatalytic repeated peptide domain (NCRPD) found at the carboxy terminus of the Neocallimastix BnaA. The NCRPD found in many glycosyl hydrolases and esterases of anaerobic fungi has been postulated to function as a docking domain for cellulase-hemicellulase complexes, similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum. The difference in domain structures indicated that the two highly similar esterases of Orpinomyces and Neocallimastix may be differently located, the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex. Sequence data indicate that AxeA and BnaA might represent a new family of hydrolases.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of a new cellulase gene encoding CelK, a major cellulosome component of Clostridium thermocellum: evidence for gene duplication and recombination.
AB  - The cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic complex of Clostridium thermocellum, termed cellulosome, consists of up to 26 polypeptides, of which at least 17 have been sequenced. They include 12 cellulases, 3 xylanases, 1 lichenase, and CipA, a scaffolding polypeptide. We report here a new cellulase gene, celK, coding for CelK, a 98-kDa major component of the cellulosome. The gene has an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,685 nucleotides coding for a polypeptide of 895 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 100,552 Da. A signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues is cut off during secretion, resulting in a mature enzyme of 97,572 Da. The nucleotide sequence is highly similar to that of cbhA (V. V. Zverlov et al., J. Bacteriol. 180:3091-3099, 1998), having an ORF of 3,690 bp coding for the 1,230-amino-acid-residue CbhA of the same bacterium. Homologous regions of the two genes are 86.5 and 84.3% identical without deletion or insertion on the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Both have domain structures consisting of a signal peptide, a family IV cellulose binding domain (CBD), a family 9 glycosyl hydrolase domain, and a dockerin domain. A striking distinction between the two polypeptides is that there is a 330-amino-acid insertion in CbhA between the catalytic domain and the dockerin domain containing a fibronectin type 3-like domain and family III CBD. This insertion, missing in CelK, is responsible for the size difference between CelK and CbhA. Upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the two genes show no homology. The data indicate that celK and cbhA in the genome of C. thermocellum have evolved through gene duplication and recombination of domain coding sequences. celK without a dockerin domain was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The enzyme had pH and temperature optima at 6.0 and 65 degrees C, respectively. It hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside with a Km and a Vmax of 1.67 microM and 15.1 U/mg, respectively. Cellobiose was a strong inhibitor of CelK activity, with a Ki of 0.29 mM. The enzyme was thermostable, after 200 h of incubation at 60 degrees C, 97% of the original activity remained. Properties of the enzyme indicated that it is a cellobiohydrolase.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences of two contiguous and highly homologous xylanase genes xynA  and xynB and characterization of XynA from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - A 5.7-kbp region of the Clostridium thermocellum F1 DNA was sequenced and found to contain two contiguous and highly homologous xylanase genes, xynA and xynB. The xynA gene encoding the xylanase XynA consists of 2049 bp and encodes a protein of 683 amino acids with a molecular mass of 74,511 Da, and the xynB gene encoding the xylanase XynB consists of 1371 bp and encodes a protein of 457 amino acids with a molecular mass of 49,883 Da. XynA is a modular enzyme composed of a typical N-terminal signal peptide and four domains in the following order: a family-II xylanase domain, a family-VI cellulose-binding domain, a dockerin domain, and a NodB domain. XynB exhibited extremely high overall sequence homology with XynA (identity 96.9%), while lacking the NodB domain present in the latter. These facts suggested that the xynA and xynB genes originated from a common ancestral gene through gene duplication. XynA was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain and characterized. The purified enzyme was highly active toward xylan; the specific activity on oat-spelt xylan was 689 units/mg protein. Immunological and zymogram analyses suggested that XynA and XynB are components of the C. thermocellum F1 cellulosome.
TI  - Thermostable aminopeptidase from Pyrococcus horikoshii.
AB  - From the genome sequence data of the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, an open reading frame was found which encodes a protein (332 amino acids) homologous with an endoglucanase from Clostridium thermocellum (42% identity), deblocking aminopeptidase from Pyrococcus furiosus (42% identity) and an aminopeptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica (18% identity). This gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the characteristics of the expressed protein were examined. Although endoglucanase activity was not detected, this protein was found to have aminopeptidase activity to cleave the N-terminal amino acid from a variety of substrates including both N-blocked and non-blocked peptides. The enzyme was stable at 90 degrees C, with the optimum temperature over 90 degrees C. The metal ion bound to this enzyme was calcium, but it was not essential for the aminopeptidase activity. Instead, this enzyme required the cobalt ion for activity. This enzyme is expected to be useful for the removal of N(alpha)-acylated residues in short peptide sequence analysis at high temperatures.
TI  - Involvement of both dockerin subdomains in assembly of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum produces an extracellular cellulase complex termed the cellulosome. It consists of a scaffolding protein, CipA, containing nine cohesin domains and a cellulose-binding domain, and at least 14 different enzymatic subunits, each containing a conserved duplicated sequence, or dockerin domain. The cohesin-dockerin interaction is responsible for the assembly of the catalytic subunits into the cellulosome structure. Each duplicated sequence of the dockerin domain contains a region bearing homology to the EF-hand calcium-binding motif. Two subdomains, each containing a putative calcium-binding motif, were constructed from the dockerin domain of CelS, a major cellulosomal catalytic subunit. These subdomains, called DS1 and DS2, were cloned by PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding of DS1 and DS2 to R3, the third cohesin domain of CipA, was analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. A stable complex was formed only when R3 was combined with both DS1 and DS2, indicating that the two halves of the dockerin domain interact with each other and such interaction is required for effective binding of the dockerin domain to the cohesin domain.
TI  - Properties of exgS, a gene for a major subunit of the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of P70, one of the three major subunits of the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome, has been determined. The gene designated as exgS (Genbank Accession No. U34793) consists of 2112 bp and encodes a protein containing 703 amino acids with a molecular mass of 77.7 kDa. ExgS has a putative signal peptide sequence of 32 amino acids. The N-terminal region is separated from the C-terminal region by a short-Pro-Thr-Pro linker. The C-terminal region of ExgS contains a duplicated sequence (DS), each sequence consisting of 22 amino acids. exgS, located 67 bp downstream of cbpA in the chromosome, is immediately upstream of a gene encoding a family 9 type endoglucanase that we have designated as EngH. This gene cluster to date consists of regA-cbpA-exgS-engH. Recombinant ExgS (rExgS) containing no signal peptide was expressed in E. coli. The rExgS actively digested several forms of cellulose, including Avicel, Sigmacell101, crystalline cellulose, and xylan, but not carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Cellotetraose was the smallest oligosaccharide substrate for rExgS. The enzymatic studies indicated that ExgS was an exoglucanase and had some properties similar to that of CelS from C. thermocellum and CelF from C.cellulolyticum. An exoglucanase has now been found to be a component of the C. cellulovorans cellulosome as well as the previously reported endoglucanases.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Clostridium thermocellum xylanase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A Clostridium thermocellum xylanase gene, designated xynX, was cloned in Escherichia coli and was categorized a novel gene as a result of the comparison of restriction patterns of the C. thermocellum xylanase genes so far reported. The xynX gene encodes a xylanase having the molecular weight of 105 kilodaltons. A number of smaller truncated proteins with activities towards 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside and xylan were also produced. The enzyme hydrolyzed xylan to xylo-oligosaccharide, indicating typical activity of endo-beta-1,4-xylanase. This endoxylanase hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose without notable reduction of the viscosity as an exo-beta-1,4-glucanase, even though the enzyme exhibited very low levels of activity against other soluble and insoluble cellulosic substrates.
TI  - Synergistic interaction of the cellulosome integrating protein (CipA) from Clostridium thermocellum with a cellulosomal endoglucanase.
AB  - Activity of a cellulosomal endoglucanase (endoglucanase E; EGE) from Clostridium  thermocellum against two crystalline forms of cellulose was enhanced by combination with the cellulosome integrating protein (CipA), but CipA did not enhance EGE activity against amorphous cellulose, even though it was able to bind to it. Similarly, CipA added in trans to genetically truncated EGE that was unable to combine with it nevertheless enhanced EGE activity against crystalline cellulose. These results indicate that the CipA cellulose binding domain does not mediate an increase in activity solely by bringing the catalytic subunits of the cellulosome complex into intimate contact with the substrate.
TI  - Synergism between the cellulosome-integrating protein CipA and endoglucanase CelD of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The cellulosome-integrating protein CipA of Clostridium thermocellum was produced from a recombinant clone of Escherichia coli and purified by cellulose affinity and anion exchange chromatography. Two active forms of C. thermocellum endoglucanase CelD were tested for binding and hydrolytic activity on Avicel in the presence and in the absence of CipA. One was 68 kDa CelD, which contains an intact dockerin domain. The other was 65 kDa CelD, in which the dockerin domain is partially deleted. CipA promoted quantitative binding of 68 kDa CelD to Avicel and enhanced its Avicelase activity by at least ten-fold. By contrast, CipA had no effect on the activity nor on the cellulose-binding affinity of the truncated 65 kDa form. These results show that interaction between CipA and the catalytic component CelD is needed for the degradation of cellulose and confirm that the interaction is mediated by the dockerin domain of CelD.
TI  - Sequence of xynC and properties of XynC, a major component of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum F1 xynC gene, which encodes the xylanase XynC, consists of 1,857 bp and encodes a protein of 619 amino acids with a molecular weight of 69,517. XynC contains a typical N-terminal signal peptide of 32 amino acid residues, followed by a 165-amino-acid sequence which is homologous to the thermostabilizing domain. Downstream of this domain was a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolase. The C terminus separated from the catalytic domain by a short linker sequence contains a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of XynC-II, the enzyme purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain, was in agreement with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence although XynC-II suffered from proteolytic truncation by a host protease(s) at the C-terminal region. Immunological and N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses disclosed that the full-length XynC is one of the major components of the C. thermocellum cellulosome. XynC-II was highly active toward xylan and slightly active toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and carboxymethyl cellulose. The Km and Vmax values for xylan were 3.9 mg/ml and 611 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. This enzyme was optimally active at 80 degrees C and was stable up to 70 degrees C at neutral pHs and over the pH range of 4 to 11 at 25 degrees C.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the family J catalytic domain derived from the Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelJ.
AB  - The Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelJ contains two different catalytic  domains in a polypeptide, i.e., a subfamily E1 catalytic domain and a family J catalytic domain [J. Bacteriol., 178, 5732-5740 (1996)]. The family J catalytic domain (CDJ-CelJ) was produced by a recombinant Escherichia coli and purified. The purified CDJ-CelJ gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the molecular weight of this enzyme (60,000) was consistent with the value (60,333) calculated from the DNA sequence. CDJ-CelJ hydrolyzed various cellulosic substrates, xylan, and lichenan but not p-nitrophenyl (PNP)-cellobioside, PNP-glucoside, or PNP-xyloside at all. CDJ-CelJ was active on Avicel, a microcrystalline cellulose, and the specific activity of CDJ-CelJ on Avicel (0.0078 U/mg protein) was comparable to that of CelS, which is recognized as the most important catalytic subunit of the C. thermocellum, cellulosome, suggesting that CelJ is also an important catalytic subunit in the cellulosome of this bacterium, in addition to CelS.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional analysis of groES and groEL genes from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The groESL operon from Clostridium thermocellum (Ct) has been isolated and sequenced, revealing two ORFs of 285 and 1626 nt, separated by 48 nt. The first ORF encoded a 94-aa 10.6-kDa GroES homologue; the second encoded a 541-aa polypeptide of 57.6 kDa, that exhibited 61% and 77% sequence identity with GroEL from Escherichia coli (Ec) and Clostridium acetobutylicum (Ca), respectively. A putative tsp, preceded by -10 and -35 consensus promoters, was identified upstream of groES. This was followed by an inverted repeat observed previously in bacterial heat shock genes. A 15-nt palindrome characteristic of a Rho-independent transcription terminator, was located downstream of groEL. The first nt of the groES translational start codon was preceded (7 nt) by a putative RBS (AGGAGG); a second RBS sequence was located 8 nt upstream of the groEL start. Production of GroE homologues by Ct was constitutive, but was enhanced significantly during a temperature upshift from 60 degrees C to 70 degrees C. The Ct GroEL, expressed in Ec as a fusion protein with GST, was purified, free of contaminating Ec GroEL.
TI  - Expression of a bacterial endo beta-1,3-glucanase gene under the control of CAMV  35S promoter in Nicotiana plumbaguinifolia protoplasts.
AB  - A gene which codes for a thermostable endo beta-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) from  a Gram positive anaerobic thermophilic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum F7, was fused to 35S promoter and polyadenylation signal of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) strain Cabb B-D. This chimaeric gene fusion was introduced into Nicotiana plumbaguinifolia protoplasts using PEG-mediated DNA transfer method of transformation. Transient expression of the thermostable endo beta-1,3-glucanase was carried out in the protoplasts and was assayed at 70 degrees C pH 8.0, suggesting that the chimaeric gene fusion: (i) is correctly transcribed and translated in plant cells; (ii) the product of translation (the thermostable endo beta-1,3-glucanase protein) is easy to assay since most of the plants' enzymes have their optimal reaction temperature at 40-60 degrees C and at neutral or weak-acidic condition which is a characteristic of plant cells; (iii) can be used as a model for studying and understanding some of the mechanisms of plant defence systems at the enzyme protein level, in case of stress conditions.
TI  - Expression, purification and crystallization of a cohesin domain from the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The cellulosome of the cellulolytic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, is a multi-enzyme complex in which the enzymatic (cellulolytic) subunits are attached to a unique nonhydrolytic subunit called scaffoldin. The attachment is mediated by two mutually interacting domains: namely multiple cohesin domains on the scaffoldin subunit and a dockerin domain on each of the enzymatic subunits. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of each of the interacting components would be critical to a better understanding of the cohesin-dockerin interaction at the molecular level. In this report, we describe the purification of one of the nine cohesin domains of the scaffoldin subunit from C. thermocellum. A DNA segment containing the cohesin 2 sequence was fused to a hexa-histidine tag, and the resultant construct was expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed peptide was efficiently isolated by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant form of the cohesin was crystallized pending determination of its structure.
TI  - Cloning of a gene encoding cinnamoyl ester hydrolase from the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14 by a novel method.
AB  - A gene (cinI) encoding a cinnamoyl ester hydrolase (CEH) has been isolated from the ruminal bacterium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14, using a model substrate, MUTMAC [4-methylumbelliferoyl (p-trimethylammonium cinnamate chloride)]. CinI has significant amino-acid similarities with members of a large and diverse family of hydrolases with a serine/aspartic acid/histidine catalytic triad. Our analyses identified two previously unclassified amino acid sequences, the amino-terminal domain of unknown function in XynZ from Clostridium thermocellum and XynC, an acetylxylan esterase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, as members of the same family of hydrolases. A previously described esterase with CEH activity, XylD from Pseudomonas fluorescens ssp. cellulosa, is not similar to CinI. CinI was expressed at high levels in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli TOPP2 and released ferulic acid from Fara [5-O-(trans-feruloyl)-arabinofuranose] prepared from wheat bran.
TI  - Subcloning of a DNA fragment encoding a single cohesin domain of the Clostridium  thermocellum cellulosome-integrating protein CipA: purification, crystallization, and preliminary diffraction analysis of the encoded polypeptide.
AB  - An Escherichia coli clone encoding a single cohesin domain of the cellulosome-integrating protein CipA from Clostridium thermocellum was constructed, and the corresponding polypeptide was purified, treated with papain, and crystallized from a PEG 8000 solution. Crystals exhibit orthorhombic symmetry, space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with cell dimensions a = 37.7 A, b = 80.7 A, c = 93.3 A, and four or eight molecules in the unit cell. The crystals diffract X-rays to beyond 2 A resolution and are suitable for further crystallographic studies.
TI  - Thermostable chaperonin from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Homologues of the chaperonins Cpn60 and Cpn10 have been purified from the Gram-positive cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum. The Cpn60 protein was purified by ATP-affinity chromatography and the Cpn10 protein was purified by gel-filtration, ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. The identities of the proteins were confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis and antigenic cross-reactivity. The Cpn60 homologue is a weak, thermostable ATPase (t1/2 at 70 decrees C more than 90 min) with optimum activity (Kcat 0.07 S-1) between 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C. The ATPase activity of the authentic Cpn60 was inhibited by Escherichia coli GroES. The catalytic properties of a recombinant C. thermocellum Cpn60 purified from a GST-Cpn60 fusion protein expressed in E. coli [Ciruela (1995) Ph.D. Thesis, University of Kent] were identical with those of the authentic C. thermocellum Cpn60. Gel-filtration studies show that at room temperature the Cpn60 migrates mainly as a heptamer. Electron microscopy confirms the presence of complexes showing 7-fold rotational symmetry and also reveals a small number of particles that seem to be tetradecamers with a similar structure to E. coli GroEL complexes.
TI  - Crystallization of a family 8 cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The catalytic domain of cellulase CelA, a family 8 glycohydrolase from C. thermocellum, has been crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions a = 50.12 A, b = 63.52 A, c = 104.97 A. The diffraction pattern extends beyond 1.5 A resolution.
TI  - Restriction endonuclease activity in Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum cell extracts exhibit specific endonuclease activity with very little non-specific exonuclease activity at 55 degrees C. The Dam methylation system of Escherichia coli offers complete protection from digestion by C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 cell extracts for all DNA tested (totaling > 100 kb, insuring that most potential restriction sequences have been exposed). Based on both the Dam recognition sequence and the similarity of cell extract and MboI DNA digests, the C. thermocellum restriction enzyme recognition sequence appears to be 5' GATC 3'. Cell extracts made from a second thermophile, C. thermosaccharolyticum ATCC 31960 do not exhibit specific endonuclease activity under the conditions tested. Genomic DNA from C. thermocellum exhibits a Dam+ phenotype while genomic DNA from C. thermosaccharolyticum exhibits a Dam- phenotype.
TI  - [Construction and analysis of transgenic plants of Nicotiana tabacum L. expressing a bacterial gene for beta-1,3-glucanase. I. Construction of vector plasmids for transfer into plants and expression of a modified gene for beta-1,3-glucanase from Clostridium thermocellum in tobacco protoplasts].
AB  - We constructed two vectors, pC27-glc and pC29-glc, that allow expression of the beta-1,3-glucanase gene (glc) in plant cells. The glc gene was previously cloned from anaerobic thermophilous bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. To increase the efficiency of expression, the N-terminal fragment of the glc gene encoding bacterial transient peptide was deleted, and hybrid variants of lacZ-glc were obtained. Analysis of expression of the hybrid genes in Escherichia coli showed that deletion of the fragment corresponding to 31 amino acids (a.a.) of beta-glucanase affected neither activity nor thermostability of the enzyme. The modified gene was subcloned into two vectors, pC27 and pC29, in which its expression was controlled by the TR2' promoter of the 2' gene of T-DNA and the rbcS promoter from Arabidopsis, respectively. Each of the resulting plasmids, pC27-glc and pC29-glc, was transfected into protoplasts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Both the plasmids were shown to allow a high level of activity of the thermostable beta-1,3-glucanase. We plan to use the vectors obtained for transformation of agrobacteria and construction of transgenic plants.
TI  - Interactions of the CelS binding ligand with various receptor domains of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosomal scaffolding protein, CipA.
AB  - The Clostridium thermocellum cellulosomal scaffolding protein, CipA, acts as an anchor on the cellulose surface for the various catalytic subunits of the cellulosome, a large extracellular cellulase complex. CipA contains nine repeated domains that serve as receptors for the cellulosomal catalytic subunits, each of which carries a conserved, duplicated ligand sequence (DS). Four representative CipA receptor domains with sequence dissimilarity were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The interaction of these cloned receptor domains with the duplicated ligand sequence of CelS (expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein, TRX-DSCelS), was studied by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TRX-DSCelS formed a stable complex with each of the four receptor domains, indicating that CelS, the most abundant cellulosomal catalytic subunit, binds nonselectively to all of the CipA receptors. Conversely, the duplicated sequence of CipA (in the form of TRX-DSCipA), which is homologous to that of CelS, did not bind to any of the receptors under the experimental conditions.
TI  - Product inhibition of the recombinant CelS, an exoglucanase component of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - CelS is the most abundant subunit and an exoglucanase component of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome, multicomponent cellulase complex. The product inhibition pattern of CelS was examined using purified recombinant CelS (rCelS) produced in Escherichia coli. The rCelS activity on cellopentaose was strongly inhibited by cellobiose. The rCelS activity was also inhibited by lactose. Glucose was only marginally inhibitory. Cellobiose appeared to inhibit the rCelS activity through a competitive mechanism. The inhibition was relieved when beta-glucosidase was added, presumably because of the conversion of cellobiose into glucose. These hydrolysis product inhibition patterns are consistent with those of the crude enzyme (cellulosome), suggesting that CelS is a rate-limiting factor in the activity of the cellulosome.
TI  - The anchorage function of CipA (CelL), a scaffolding protein of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - Enzymatic cellulose degradation is a heterogeneous reaction requiring binding of  soluble cellulase molecules to the solid substrate. Based on our studies of the cellulase complex of Clostridium thermocellum (the cellulosome), we have previously proposed that such binding can be brought about by a special "anchorage subunit." In this "anchor-enzyme" model, CipA (a major subunit of the cellulosome) enhances the activity of CelS (the most abundant catalytic subunit of the cellulosome) by anchoring it to the cellulose surface. We have subsequently reported that CelS contains a conserved duplicated sequence at its C terminus and that CipA contains nine repeated sequences with a cellulose binding domain (CBD) in between the second and third repeats. In this work, we reexamined the anchor-enzyme mechanism by using recombinant CelS (rCelS) and various CipA domains, CBD, R3 (the repeat next to CBD), and CBD/R3, expressed in Escherichia coli. As analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, rCelS, through its conserved duplicated sequence, formed a stable complex with R3 or CBD/R3 but not with CBD. Although R3 or CBD alone did not affect the binding of rCelS to cellulose, such binding was dependent on CBD/R3, indicating the anchorage role of CBD/R3. Such anchorage apparently increased the rCelS activity toward crystalline cellulose. These results substantiate the proposed anchor-enzyme model and the expected roles of individual CipA domains and the conserved duplicated sequence of CelS.
TI  - Direct isolation of functional genes encoding cellulases from the microbial consortia in a thermophilic, anaerobic digester maintained on lignocellulose.
AB  - Gene libraries ("zoolibraries") were constructed in Escherichia coli using DNA isolated from the mixed liquor of thermophilic, anaerobic digesters, which were in continuous operation with lignocellulosic feedstocks for over 10 years. Clones expressing cellulase and xylosidase were readily recovered from these libraries. Four clones that hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose and methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobiopyranoside were characterized. All four cellulases exhibited temperature optima (60-65 degrees C) and pH optima (pH 6-7) in accordance with conditions of the enrichment. The DNA sequence of the insert in one clone (plasmid pFGH1) was determined. This plasmid encoded an endoglucanase (celA) and part of a putative beta-glucosidase (celB), both of which were distinctly different from all previously reported homologues. CelA protein shared limited homology with members of the A3 subfamily of cellulases, being similar to endoglucanase C from Clostridium thermocellum (40% identity). The N-terminal part of CelB protein was most similar to beta-glucosidase from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa (28% homology). The use of zoolibraries constructed from natural or laboratory enrichment cultures offers the potential to discover many new enzymes for biotechnological applications.
TI  - OlpB, a new outer layer protein of Clostridium thermocellum, and binding of its S-layer-like domains to components of the cell envelope.
AB  - Several proteins of Clostridium thermocellum possess a C-terminal triplicated sequence related to bacterial cell surface proteins. This sequence was named the SLH domain (for S-layer homology), and it was proposed that it might serve to anchor proteins to the cell surface (A. Lupas, H. Engelhardt, J. Peters, U. Santarius, S. Volker, and W. Baumeister, J. Bacteriol. 176:1224-1233, 1994). This hypothesis was investigated by using the SLH-containing protein ORF1p from C. thermocellum as a model. Subcellular fractionation, immunoblotting, and electron microscopy of immunocytochemically labeled cells indicated that ORF1p was located on the surface of C. thermocellum. To detect C. thermocellum components interacting with the SLH domains of ORF1p, a probe was constructed by grafting these domains on the C terminus of the MalE protein of Escherichia coli. The SLH domains conferred on the chimeric protein (MalE-ORF1p-C) the ability to bind noncovalently to the peptidoglycan of C. thermocellum. In addition, 125I-labeled MalE-ORF1p-C was shown to bind to SLH-bearing proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose, and to a 26- to 28-kDa component of the cell envelope. These results agree with the hypothesis that SLH domains contribute to the binding of exocellular proteins to the cell surface of bacteria. The gene carrying ORF1 and its product, ORF1p, are renamed olpB and OlpB (for outer layer protein B), respectively.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of the cellulose-binding domain of the scaffoldin subunit from the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The major cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum YS was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was purified efficiently by a modification of a novel procedure termed affinity digestion. The properties of the purified polypeptide were compared with those of a related CBD derived from a cellulosome-like complex of a similar (but mesophilic) clostridial species, Clostridium cellulovorans. The binding properties of the two proteins with their common substrate were found to be very similar. Despite the similarity in the amino acid sequences of the two CBDs, polyclonal antibodies raised against the CBD from C. thermocellum failed to interact with the protein from C. cellulovorans. Chemical modification of the single cysteine of the CBD had little effect on the binding to cellulose. Biotinylation of this cysteine allowed the efficient binding of avidin to cellulose, and the resultant matrix is appropriate for use as a universal affinity system.
TI  - The resistance of cellulases and xylanases to proteolytic inactivation.
AB  - The sensitivity of a range of cellulases and xylanases to proteolytic inactivation was investigated. The xylanases, all the Clostridium thermocellum cellulases and cellulase E from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa exhibited no decrease in catalytic activity during a 3-h incubation with proteinases of the small intestine. Under these conditions, the control Escherichia coli enzymes analysed had half-lives of 4.3-13.5 min. The addition of substrate significantly decreased the sensitivity of proteinase-labile enzymes to inactivation. The significance of these data in relation to the use of cellulases and xylanases for improving animal nutrition is discussed.
TI  - Evidence for a general role for non-catalytic thermostabilizing domains in xylanases from thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium thermocellum DNA constructed in lambda ZAPII was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. Cross-hybridization experiments revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was designated xyn Y. The encoded enzyme, xylanase Y (XYLY), displayed features characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees C respectively, and the recombinant XYLY, expressed by Escherichia coli had a maximum Mr of 116000. The nucleotide sequence of xyn Y contained an open reading frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted Mr 120 105. The encoded enzyme contained a typical N-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 amino acid sequence, designated domain A, that was not essential for catalytic activity. Downstream of domain A was a 351-residue xylanase Family F catalytic domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity with a thermostable domain of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase A. The C-terminal portion of XYLY comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking sequence found in all other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are constituents of the bacterium's multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the N-terminal region of C. thermocellum xylanase Z. The enzyme did not contain linker sequences found in other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. Analysis of truncated forms of XYLY and hybrid proteins, comprising segments of XYLY fused to the E. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that XYLY contained a central catalytic domain and an adjacent thermostable domain. The C-terminal domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against XYLY showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and did not appear to be extensively glycosylated. The non-catalytic domains of XYLY are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases.
TI  - Expression, purification and subunit-binding properties of cohesins 2 and 3 of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - The enzymatic subunits of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum are integrated into the complex by a major non-catalytic polypeptide, called scaffoldin. Its numerous functional domains include a single cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and nine subunit-binding domains, or cohesin domains. Two of the cohesin domains, together with the adjacent CBD, have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant constructs were purified by affinity chromatography on a cellulosic matrix. Both cohesin domains, which differ by about 30% in their primary structure, showed a similar binding profile to the cellulosomal subunits. Calcium ions enhanced dramatically this binding. Under the conditions of the assay, only one major catalytic subunit of the cellulosome failed to bind to either cohesin domain. The results indicate a lack of selectivity in the binding of cohesin domains to the catalytic subunits and also suggest that additional mechanisms may be involved in cellulosome assembly.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the major cellulose-binding domain of the cellulosome from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The cellulose-binding domain from the scaffoldin subunit of the cellulosome from  Clostridium thermocellum strain YS has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion using polyethylene glycol as precipitant. They belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 64.68 A, b = 50.36 A, c = 96.27 A; beta = 99.43 degrees, and density packing considerations suggest that the asymmetric unit contains two molecules. The crystals diffract beyond 2.0 A resolution using a laboratory rotating anode source.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Clostridium thermocellum celS gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 produces an extremely complicated multi-component cellulase aggregate (cellulosome) highly active on crystalline cellulose. From the cellulosome, two subunits, CelS (or Ss; M(r) = 82,000) and CelL (or SL, CipA; M(r) = 250,000), have been identified as essential for crystalline cellulose degradation [Wu et al. (1988) Biochemistry 27:1703]. We have determined the DNA sequence of the celS gene from four cloned DNA fragments encompassing this gene [Wang et al. (1993) J Bacteriol 175:1293]. To express the entire celS gene in Escherichia coli, the celS structural gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing the PCR primers corresponding to sequences flanking the desired gene. This PCR product (2.1 x 10(3) bases; 2.1 kb) was cloned into an E. coli expression vector pRSET B. Subsequent expression of the cloned gene resulted in a fusion protein (rCelS; M(r) = 86,000) as inclusion bodies. The rCelS protein was recognized specifically by an anti-CelS antiserum in a Western blot analysis. The inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in 5 M urea. The refolded rCelS produced very little reducing sugar from carboxymethylcellulose. However, it showed a higher activity on the crystalline cellulose (Avicel) and an even higher activity on phosphoric-acid-swollen Avicel. These results indicate that the CelS is an exoglucanase.
TI  - Features of the cellodextrinase gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb DNA fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (cedA) from the ruminal anaerobe Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 was determined. Activity was expressed from this fragment when it was cloned in both orientations in pBluescript KS+ and SK-, indicating a functional F. succinogenes promoter in Escherichia coli. Promoter sequences (TTGAACA and AATAA) were identified upstream of the ATG initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site. The cedA open reading frame of 1071 base pairs encoded a protein of 357 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41.9 kDa, similar to the 40-kDa size of the native protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography. CedA is proposed to belong to family 5 (family A) of the glycosyl hydrolases. The primary structure of the cellodextrinase showed over 40% similarity with endoglucanase 3 from F. succinogenes S85. Short regions of similarity were also demonstrated with endoglucanase C from Clostridium thermocellum, CelA from Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and two exoglucanases from yeast.
TI  - Characterization of two crystal forms of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelC.
AB  - Endoglucanase CelC from Clostridium thermocellum expressed in Escherichia coli has been crystallized in two different crystal forms by the hanging drop method. Crystals of form I were grown with polyethylene glycol as a precipitant. They are orthorhombic, space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with cell dimensions a = 51.4 A, b = 84.3 A, and c = 87.5 A. Crystals of form II, obtained in ammonium sulfate solutions, belong to the tetragonal space group P4(1)2(1)2 (or P4(3)2(1)2) with cell dimensions of a = b = 130.7 A and c = 69.6 A. Diffraction data to 2.8 A resolution were observed for both crystal forms with a rotating anode generator. Preliminary oscillation images of the orthorhombic form I crystals using a synchrotron radiation source show diffraction to 2.2 A resolution, indicating that these crystals are suitable for high resolution crystallographic analysis.
TI  - Recognition specificity of the duplicated segments present in Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelD and in the cellulosome-integrating protein CipA.
AB  - The binding specificity of the duplicated segments borne by Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelD and by the cellulosome-integrating protein CipA was investigated. The fusion protein CelC-DSCelD, in which the duplicated segment of CelD was fused to the COOH terminus of endoglucanase CelC, bound with an affinity of 4.7 x 10(7) M-1 to the fusion protein MalE-RDCipA, in which the seventh receptor domain of CipA was grafted onto the COOH terminus of the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein MalE. The affinity of CelC-DSCelD for the homologous chimeric protein MalE-RDORF3p, carrying the receptor of the surface protein ORF3p, was 6.9 x 10(6) M-1. The fusion protein CelC-DSCipA, in which the duplicated segment of CipA was grafted onto the COOH terminus of CelC, did not bind detectably to MalE-RDCipA or MalE-RDORF3p. However, Western blotting (immunoblotting) experiments indicated that the duplicated segment of CipA was able to bind to a set of C. thermocellum proteins which are different from those recognized by the duplicated segment of CelD. These results argue against the hypothesis that ORF3p interacts with the duplicated segment of CipA. More probably, ORF3p binds to individual cellulases and hemicellulases harboring duplicated segments.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a complex forming hydrophilic endoglucanase of  Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - An endoglucanase (EG5) of Clostridium thermocellum was purified to the homogeneity from the recombinant strains of Escherichia coli. The elution pattern of EG5 on gel filtration column showed the Mr of 100 kDa. However, the SDS-PAGE of the same protein showed the Mr of 35 kDa. This indicates the formation of a soluble trimeric complex by EG5 in non-denaturing conditions. The complex was found to be stable in 100 mM Na-taurocholate or 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. The hydrophilic nature of EG5 was confirmed by its unretarded elution at high salt concentrations from gel filtration columns. pI of EG5 was determined as 4.75. The EG5 was shown to possess high thermostability (stable at 65 degrees C for several days) and a broad pH range of activity from 5.5 to 7.5. The EG5 was capable of degrading a variety of soluble cellulosic substrates, and was able to enhance the rate and extent of soluble and natural crystalline cellulose hydrolysis by a cellobiohydrolase (CBH3) of C. thermocellum. The combination of properties, like intramolecular complex formation, high thermostability and positive synergistic effect offered by a cellulolytic component of C. thermocellum is being reported for the first time.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary diffraction analysis of the catalytic domain of xylanase Z from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The catalytic domain of a thermostable xylanase from Clostridium thermocellum has been expressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized from a polyethylene glycol 2000 solution by the hanging drop method. Crystals belong to the triclinic space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 46.8 A, b = 50.8 A, c = 70.3 A, alpha = 100.7 degrees, beta = 83.8 degrees, gamma = 101.6 degrees, and two molecules in the unit cell. These crystals diffract X-rays to at least 1.8 A resolution and are suitable for high-resolution X-ray analysis.
TI  - Properties conferred on Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelC by grafting the duplicated segment of endoglucanase CelD.
AB  - The DNA sequence encoding the duplicated 22 amino acid segment of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelD was fused to the 3'-terminus of the celC gene encoding C.thermocellum endoglucanase CelC. The presence of the duplicated segment endowed CelC with the capacity to form cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing active enzyme when the hybrid gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. Inclusion body formation prevented proteolytic cleavage of the duplicated segment. The intact hybrid protein CelC-Cel'D was purified from inclusion bodies and characterized. In contrast to CelC, CelC-Cel'D was able to bind to CipA, a protein acting as a scaffolding component of the C.thermocellum cellulase complex (cellulosome). However, the catalytic properties of CelC-Cel'D were similar to those of CelC. These results suggest that foreign proteins tagged with the duplicated segment could be incorporated into the cellulosome in order to modify the enzymatic properties of the complex. The formation of inclusion bodies by proteins carrying the duplicated segment may also prove a convenient means of purifying cloned gene products that are sensitive to proteolytic degradation.
TI  - DNA sequences and expression in Streptomyces lividans of an exoglucanase gene and an endoglucanase gene from Thermomonospora fusca.
AB  - Two genes encoding cellulases E1 and E4 from Thermomonospora fusca have been cloned in Escherichia coli, and their DNA sequences have been determined. Both genes were introduced into Streptomyces lividans, and the enzymes were purified from the culture supernatants of transformants. E1 and E4 were expressed 18- and 4-fold higher, respectively, in S. lividans than in E. coli. Thin-layer chromatography of digestion products showed that E1 digests cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose to cellobiose and a trace of glucose. E4 is poor at degrading cellotriose and cleaves cellopentaose to cellotetraose and glucose or cellotriose and cellobiose. It readily cleaves cellotetraose to cellobiose. E1 shows 59% identity to Cellulomonas fumi CenC in a 689-amino-acid overlap, and E4 shows 80% identity to the N terminus of C. fimi CenB in a 441-amino-acid overlap; all of these proteins are members of cellulase family E. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of Clostridium thermocellum celD, E1, E4, and four other members of family E demonstrates a clear relationship between their catalytic domains, although there is as little as 25% identity between some of them. Residues in celD that have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification to be important for catalytic activity are conserved in all seven proteins. The catalytic domains of E1 and E4 are not similar to those of T. fusca E2 or E5, but all four enzymes share similar cellulose-binding domains and have the same 14-bp inverted repeat upstream of their initiation codons. This sequence has been identified previously as the binding site for a protein that regulates induction.
TI  - [Purification and some properties of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase, formed by a recombinant Escherichia coli strain].
AB  - The endoglucanase (EG5) has been isolated from the recombinant strain of E. coli  TG1 carrying a plasmid with C. thermocellum F7 chromosomal DNA insertion. Using high performance ion-exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing, the enzyme was 98-fold purified with a 27% yield. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 35 kDa (SDS-PAGE data) and is represented by three isoforms with pI 4.4-4.8 (isoelectrofocusing data). The activity of EG5 was determined by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose, amorphous cellulose, xylan, lichenan and avicel. The optimal conditions for these substrates hydrolysis are: pH 6.0-6.5, 80 degrees C (60 degrees C for avicel).
TI  - Purification and properties of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase 5 produced  in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Endoglucanase 5 (EG5) has been isolated from the strain of E. coli TG1 harboring  recombinant plasmid pCU108, which contains the cel5 gene of C. thermocellum. The enzyme has been produced with 98-fold purification and a final yield of 27% by using subsequent twofold high performance ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q and high performance chromatofocusing on Mono P. The protein has a mol mass of 35 kDa and includes 3 multiple forms with pI 4.4-4.8 as evidenced by analytical gel isoelectrofocusing. EG5 cleaves CMC (Km = 0.097 g/L, Vmax = 8.2 mg/min.mg of protein), amorphous cellulose, xylan, lichenan as a substrate with an optimum temperature of 80 degrees C and pH 6.0 and Avicel (Km = 18.2 g/L, Vmax = 0.035 mg/min.mg of protein) with an optimum temperature of 60 degrees C and pH 6.0. Cellobiose in concentrations up to 200 micrograms/mL do not inhibit the hydrolysis of CMC by EG5, but 10-30 micrograms/mL of glucose significantly decrease the activity of this enzyme. The stimulating role of calcium chloride and concentration of protein in the system has been demonstrated for Avicel hydrolysis by EG5.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the celG gene of Clostridium thermocellum and characterization of its product, endoglucanase CelG.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the celG gene of Clostridium thermocellum, encoding endoglucanase CelG, was determined. The open reading frame extended over 1,698 bp and encoded a 566-amino-acid polypeptide (molecular weight of 63,128) similar to the C. thermocellum endoglucanase CelB (51.5% identical residues). The N terminus displayed a typical signal peptide, followed by a catalytic domain. The C terminus, which was separated from the catalytic domain by a 25-amino-acid segment rich in Pro, Thr, and Ser, contained two conserved stretches of 22 amino acids closely similar to those previously described in other cellulases from the same organism. Expression of the gene in Escherichia coli was increased by fusing the fragment coding for the catalytic domain in frame with the start of the lacZ' gene present in the vector. A low- and a high-M(r) form of the protein were purified. The two forms displayed identical enzymatic properties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that both forms consist of a major polypeptide of M(r) 50,000 and two minor polypeptides of M(r)s 49,000 and 48,000, resulting from heterogeneous proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus. An antiserum raised against the forms purified from E. coli reacted with an immunoreactive polypeptide of M(r) 66,000, which was associated with the extracellular cellulolytic complex of C. thermocellum known as the cellulosome.
TI  - Isolation of a cellobiohydrolase of Clostridium thermocellum capable of degrading natural crystalline substrates.
AB  - A cellobiohydrolase (CBH3) of Clostridium thermocellum was isolated from the recombinant strains of Escherichia coli. The enzyme was shown to have a Mr of 78 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.75. The hydrophilic nature of the enzyme was confirmed by its unretarded elution on gel filtration column. The enzyme had a binding affinity for the microcrystalline substrate (Avicel). The pH and temperature optimum were determined as 6.5 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme was found to be active on p-nitrophenyl cellobioside, carboxymethyl cellulose, Avicel, amorphous cellulose, lichenan and xylan. The most distinguishing feature of CBH3 was the degradation of a variety of natural crystalline substrates, with maximum activity on filter paper. The enzyme was tolerant to high levels of cellobiose, susceptible to heavy metals and was protected by DTT and calcium at higher temperatures. This is the first report of a highly active cellobiohydrolase produced in C. thermocellum.
TI  - Purification and properties of the Clostridium thermocellum bglB gene product expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Clostridium thermocellum beta-glucosidase B was purified to homogeneity in its recombinant form from Escherichia coli. The purification protocol included ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction and hydroxyapatite chromatography. The polypeptide was found to have a molecular mass of 84,000 daltons and a pI of 4.4. There was a differential effect of temperature on the aryl-beta-glucosidase and cellobiase activities of the purified protein. The cellobiase activity had an optimum of 45 degrees C, and aryl-beta-glucosidase 60 degrees C. Both activities had an optimum pH of 5.6, although the aryl-beta-glucosidase had a secondary peak at 7.0. Both activities were stimulated by divalent cations and DTT, but inhibited by thiol reagents. The enzyme was found to have a broad substrate specificity. Using cellobiose as substrate and a temperature of 45 degrees C, the Km and Vmax values were 1.6 mM and 5.5 U mg-1 respectively. The aryl-beta-glucosidase when assayed against pNP glucopyranoside and a temperature of 60 degrees C had Km and Vmax of 2.9 mM and 1.1 U mg-1 respectively. The enzyme was very stable at 45 degrees C, but rapidly inactivated at 60 degrees C.
TI  - Analysis of the Rhizobium meliloti exoH/exoK/exoL fragment: ExoK shows homology to excreted endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases and ExoH resembles membrane proteins.
AB  - Nucleotide sequencing of a 4.15 kb DNA fragment from megaplasmid 2 of Rhizobium meliloti 2011 revealed the location of the genes exoH, exoK and exoL. The putative proteins encoded by these genes have molecular weights of 41, 30, and 44 kDa, respectively. The hydrophobicity profile of the ExoH amino acid sequence resembles that of transmembrane proteins. The predicted exoL gene product does not contain hydrophobic regions, indicating a cytoplasmic localization. The exoK gene product is characterized by a putative signal peptide and exhibits significant homology to endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases of bacilli and Clostridium thermocellum. R. meliloti exoK mutants induced pink nodules and synthesized a reduced amount of exopolysaccharide (EPS). Colonies of this mutant showed a delay in the appearance of the Calcofluor white fluorescence. In addition, the formation of the characteristic halo was strongly delayed. R. meliloti exoL and exoH mutants induced pseudonodules. The exoH, but not the exoL mutant, synthesized an EPS that could be precipitated by cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) and also by ethanol. Plasmid integration mutagenesis revealed promoter regions preceding exoH, exoK and exoL.
TI  - Secretion of a prokaryotic cellulase in bacterial and mammalian cells.
AB  - The catalytic domain of mature Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase E (EGE') and derivatives of the enzyme fused to prokaryote and eukaryote signal peptides (SP), were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Escherichia coli. All three forms of the endoglucanase were secreted into the periplasm of Escherichia coli, but only derivatives of the enzyme containing an N-terminal SP were exported from CHO cells. Extracellular EGE', purified from E. coli and CHO cultures, displayed similar properties suggesting that glycosylation of the enzyme in the eukaryote did not significantly alter the protein's properties. Data presented in this report indicate that mature EGE' contains secretion signals which are recognised only by the E. coli protein export apparatus, suggesting that there are differences in the recognition of certain secretion signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. As mature EGE' does not contain secretion signals recognised by the mammalian cell, membrane translocation of the bacterial cellulase in a higher eukaryote is directed by an N-terminal prokaryotic SP.
TI  - [Specific proteolysis of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase upon heterologous expression in Escherichia coli cells].
AB  - The cel(1) gene of Clostridium thermocellum encoding endoglucanase cloned earlier in Escherichia coli was deleted at specific sites and fused with the E. coli gene lacZ'. Analysis of heterologous expression of the produced variants was performed. It was established that the post-translational modification of the clostridial endoglucanase in E. coli involves a membrane-linked N-terminal cleavage of 6 kDa polypeptide during secretion through the cytoplasmic membrane and a C-terminal cleavage of 4 kDa protein not related to the secretion. A comparative study of the authors' and literature data supports the suggestions that: (i) the cel(1) cloned in this laboratory is a deleted variant of the cloned cel(1) gene of C. thermocellum described previously by other authors, and (ii) the C-terminal proteolysis of the endoglucanase precursor takes place in a linker region connecting the catalytic and cellulose binding domains. An account of similar kind of proteolysis responsible for multiple forms of cellulolytic enzymes is given.
TI  - Gene sequence and properties of CelI, a family E endoglucanase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The Clostridium thermocellum celI gene, coding for endoglucanase I (CelI), consists of an open reading frame (ORF) of 2640 nucleotides and codes for a protein of M(r) 98531. The ORF was confirmed as celI by comparing the N-terminal sequence of purified recombinant CelI with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence. CelI hydrolysed lichenan and carboxymethylcellulose, but was principally active against barley beta-glucan. It exhibited significant sequence identity with subfamily E2 endoglucanases, and by analogy with others in this group contains a catalytic domain of around 500 residues located in the N-terminal half of the protein. The C-terminal region of CelI was highly homologous with the cellulose-binding domain of the non-catalytic cellulosome subunit, S1. A repeated segment, previously shown to be highly conserved in xylanase Z and in other endoglucanases from C. thermocellum, was absent from CelI. Antiserum raised against purified recombinant CelI cross-reacted with proteins contained in the cellulosomes of two strains of C. thermocellu, suggesting that CelI is either a component of the cellulosome or is homologous to other cellulosome proteins. A second gene, located upstream of celI, consisted of an ORF of 1671 nucleotides, coding for a protein of M(r) 61042. Based on its homology with the Escherichia coli tar gene product, the polypeptide encoded by the second gene is tentatively identified as a sensory transducer.
TI  - The gene encoding the cellulase (Avicelase) Cel1 from Streptomyces reticuli and analysis of protein domains.
AB  - Streptomyces reticuli produces an unusual cellulase (Avicelase), with an apparent molecular weight of 82 kDa, which is solely sufficient to degrade crystalline cellulose. During cultivation the processing of the Avicelase to a truncated enzyme (42 kDa) and an inactive protein (40 kDa) correlated with the occurrence of an extracellular protease. After its purification this 36 kDa protease cleaved the S. reticuli Avicelase in vitro in the same manner. Using antibodies raised against the Avicelase and its truncated form (42 kDa) and gene libraries of S. reticuli DNA in the Escherichia coli phage vectors lambda gt11 and Charon 35, the Avicelase gene (cel1) was identified. Further subcloning and DNA-sequencing revealed a G+C rich (72%) reading frame of 2238 bp encoding a protein of 746 amino acids. The transcriptional start site was mapped about 180 bp upstream from the GTG start codon. A signal sequence of 29 amino acids was identified by aligning the deduced amino acids with the characterized N-terminus of the 82 kDa Avicelase. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acids from the purified proteins with the amino acid sequence derived from the Avicelase gene revealed that the truncated enzyme (42 kDa) corresponds to the C-terminal region whereas the inactive proteolytically derived protein (40 kDa) represents the N-terminal part of the 82 kDa Avicelase. Comparisons with amino acid sequences deduced from known cellulase genes indicated the presence of three putative protein domains: (i) an N-terminal part showing significant similarity with a repeat region of endoglucanase C from Cellulomonas fimi, recently shown to be a cellulose-binding domain; (ii) an adjoining region sharing homology with the N-terminal domains with unknown function of endoglucanase A from Pseudomonas fluorescens, endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum and a cellodextrinase from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and (iii) a C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to cellulase family E.
TI  - Synergism between Clostridium thermocellum cellulases cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We have obtained a synergistic effect during degradation of Avicel and filter paper by Clostridium thermocellum cellulases (two endoglucanases and one cellobiohydrolase) cloned in Escherichia coli. The highest degree of synergism was found at early stages of reaction, during the first 20 h: 2.5 and 2.9 on Avicel and filter paper, respectively. During combined action of all three cellulases the main product is cellobiose.
TI  - Development of Thermus-Escherichia shuttle vectors and their use for expression of the Clostridium thermocellum celA gene in Thermus thermophilus.
AB  - We describe the self-selection of replication origins of undescribed cryptic plasmids from Thermus aquaticus Y-VII-51B (ATCC 25105) and a Thermus sp. strain (ATCC 27737) by random insertion of a thermostable kanamycin adenyltransferase cartridge. Once selected, these autonomous replication origins were cloned into the Escherichia coli vector pUC9 or pUC19. The bifunctional plasmids were analyzed for their sizes, relationships, and properties as shuttle vectors for Thermus-Escherichia cloning. Seven different vectors with diverse kanamycin resistance levels, stabilities, transformation efficiencies, and copy numbers were obtained. As a general rule, those from T. aquaticus (pLU1 to pLU4) were more stable than those from the Thermus sp. (pMY1 to pMY3). To probe their usefulness, we used one of the plasmids (pMY1) to clone in E. coli a modified form of the cellulase gene (celA) from Clostridium thermocellum in which the native signal peptide was replaced in vitro by that from the S-layer gene of T. thermophilus HB8. The hybrid product was expressed and exported by E. coli. When the gene was transferred by transformation into T. thermophilus, the cellulase protein was also expressed and secreted at 70 degrees C.
TI  - Characterization of the gene celD and its encoded product 1,4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase D from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.
AB  - A genomic library of Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa DNA constructed in  pUC18 and expressed in Escherichia coli was screened for recombinants expressing 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucoside hydrolysing activity (MUGase). A single MUGase-positive clone was isolated. The MUGase hydrolysed cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose and cellohexaose to glucose, by sequentially cleaving glucose residues from the non-reducing end of the cello-oligosaccharides. The Km values for cellobiose and cellohexaose hydrolysis were 1.2 mM and 28 microM respectively. The enzyme exhibited no activity against soluble or insoluble cellulose, xylan and xylobiose. Thus the MUGase is classified as a 1,4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.74) and is designated 1,4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase D (CELD). When expressed by E. coli, CELD was located in the cell-envelope fraction; a significant proportion of the native enzyme was also associated with the cell envelope when synthesized by its endogenous host. The nucleotide sequence of the gene, celD, which encodes CELD, revealed an open reading frame of 2607 bp, encoding a protein of M(r) 92,000. The deduced primary structure of CELD was confirmed by the M(r) of CELD (85,000) expressed by E. coli and P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa, and by the experimentally determined N-terminus of the enzyme purified from E. coli, which showed identity with residues 52-67 of the celD translated sequence. The structure of the N-terminal region of full-length CELD was similar to the signal peptides of P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa plant-cell-wall hydrolases. Deletion of the N-terminal 47 residues of CELD solubilized MUGase activity in E. coli. CELD exhibited sequence similarity with beta-glucosidase B of Clostridium thermocellum, particularly in the vicinity of the active-site aspartate residue, but did not display structural similarity with the mature forms of cellulases and xylanases expressed by P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.
TI  - Conversion of xylan to ethanol by ethanologenic strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - A two-stage process was evaluated for the fermentation of polymeric feedstocks to ethanol by a single, genetically engineered microorganism. The truncated xylanase gene (xynZ) from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum was fused with the N terminus of lacZ to eliminate secretory signals. This hybrid gene was expressed at high levels in ethanologenic strains of Escherichia coli KO11 and Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1(pLOI555). Large amounts of xylanase (25 to 93 mU/mg of cell protein) accumulated as intracellular products during ethanol production. Cells containing xylanase were harvested at the end of fermentation and added to a xylan solution at 60 degrees C, thereby releasing xylanase for saccharification. After cooling, the hydrolysate was fermented to ethanol with the same organism (30 degrees C), thereby replenishing the supply of xylanase for a subsequent saccharification. Recombinant E. coli metabolized only xylose, while recombinant K. oxytoca M5A1 metabolized xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose but not xylotetrose. Derivatives of this latter organism produced large amounts of intracellular xylosidase, and the organism is presumed to transport both xylobiose and xylotriose for intracellular hydrolysis. By using recombinant M5A1, approximately 34% of the maximal theoretical yield of ethanol was obtained from xylan by this two-stage process. The yield appeared to be limited by the digestibility of commercial xylan rather than by a lack of sufficient xylanase or by ethanol toxicity. In general form, this two-stage process, which uses a single, genetically engineered microorganism, should be applicable for the production of useful chemicals from a wide range of biomass polymers.
TI  - Inclusion bodies of the thermophilic endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum are made of native enzyme that resists 8 M urea.
AB  - Endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum was purified from inclusion bodies  formed upon its overproduction in Escherichia coli, using 5 M urea as a solubilizing solution. We examined the effects of denaturing agents upon the stability of the pure soluble enzyme as a function of the temperature. At room temperature, guanidinium chloride induces an irreversible denaturation. By comparison, we observed no structural or functional effects at room temperature using high concentrations of urea as denaturing agent. The irreversible denaturation process observed with guanidinium chloride also occurs with urea but only at elevated temperature (greater than or equal to 60 degrees C); in 6 M urea, the activation energy of the denaturation reaction is decreased by a factor of only 1.8. We interpret the high resistance of this protein to urea as reflecting a reduced flexibility of its structure at normal temperatures which should be correlated to the thermophilic origin of this protein.
TI  - Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa: an alternative model for bacterial cellulase.
AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa, a Gram-negative soil bacterium, can utilize crystalline cellulose or xylan as main sources of carbon and energy. Synthesis of endoglucanases and xylanases is induced by Avicel, filter paper, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan and is repressed by cellobiose, glucose or xylose. These enzymes are secreted into the culture supernatant fluid and do not form aggregates or associate with the cell surface. Cells of Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa do not adhere to cellulose. In cultures containing Avicel or filter paper, a significant proportion of the secreted cellulase and xylanase activities becomes tightly bound to the insoluble cellulose. Western blotting has revealed that endoglucanase B, xylanase A and a cellodextrinase encoded by genes previously isolated from Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and expressed in Escherichia coli, are synthesized by the pseudomonad under a variety of conditions. These enzymes appear to be post-translationally modified, probably through glycosylation. Overall, it appears that the cellulase/hemicellulase system of Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa differs from the model established for celluloytic anaerobes such as Clostridium thermocellum.
TI  - Characterization and comparison of Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanases-xylanases EngB and EngD hyperexpressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - By the use of a T7 expression system, endoglucanases-xylanases EngB and EngD from Clostridium cellulovorans were hyperexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The two enzymes demonstrated both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. The substrate specificities of both endoglucanases were similar except that EngD had four-times-greater p-nitrophenyl beta-1,4-cellobiosidase activity. The two proteins were very homologous (80%) up to the Pro-Thr-Thr region which divided the protein into -NH2- and -COOH-terminals. The -COOH- region of EngB has high homology to the endoglucanases and a xylanase from Clostridium thermocellum and to an endoglucanase from Clostridium cellulolyticum and did not show strong binding to cellulose (Avicel). However, the -COOH- region of EngD, which had homology to the cellulose-binding domains of Cellulomonas fimi exo- and endoglucanases and to Pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase, demonstrated binding ability to cellulose even when the domain was fused to the N-terminal domain of EngB. By probing the Avicel-purified cellulase complex (F8) with anti-EngB and anti-EngD antibodies, both EngB and EngD were shown to be present on the cellulase complex of C. cellulovorans. Many proteins homologous to EngB and EngD were also present on the complex.
TI  - Two beta-glycanase genes are clustered in Bacillus polymyxa: molecular cloning, expression, and sequence analysis of genes encoding a xylanase and an endo-beta-(1,3)-(1,4)-glucanase.
AB  - Two genes, xynD and gluB, encoding a xylanase and an endo-beta-(1,3)-(1,4)-glucanase (lichenase) from Bacillus polymyxa have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. A sequenced DNA fragment of 4,466 bp contains both genes, which are separated by 155 bp. The xynD and gluB genes encode proteins of 67.8 kDa (XYND) and 27 kDa (GLUB). Two peptides with molecular masses of 62 and 53 kDa appear in cell extracts of E. coli and culture supernatants of B. subtilis clones containing the xynD gene. Both peptides show xylanase activity in zymogram analysis. The XYND enzyme also shows alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activity. The XYND peptide and the xylanase XYNZ from Clostridium thermocellum (O. Grepinet, M. C. Chebrou, and P. Beguin, J. Bacteriol. 170:4582-4588, 1988) show 64% homology in a stretch of about 280 amino acids.
TI  - Characterization of endoglucanase A from Clostridium cellulolyticum.
AB  - A construction was carried out to obtain a high level of expression in Escherichia coli of the gene celCCA, coding for the endoglucanase A from Clostridium cellulolyticum (EGCCA). The enzyme was purified in two forms with different molecular weights, 51,000 and 44,000. The smaller protein was probably the result of proteolysis, although great care was taken to prevent this process from occurring. Evidence was found for the loss of the conserved reiterated domains which are characteristic of C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum cellulases. The two forms were extensively studied, and it was demonstrated that although they had the same pH and temperature optima, they differed in their catalytic properties. The truncated protein gave the more efficient catalytic parameters on carboxymethyl cellulose and showed improved endoglucanase characteristics, whereas the intact enzyme showed truer cellulase characteristics. The possible role of clostridial reiterated domains in the hydrolytic activity toward crystalline cellulose is discussed.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Clostridium thermocellum DNA fragment that encodes a  protein related to cellulosome component SL.
AB  - Antibodies raised against the SL subunit of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome were used to screen a library of C. thermocellum chromosomal DNA fragments constructed in the vector lambda gt11. A DNA fragment that encoded a polypeptide that crossreacted with the anti-SL antibodies was isolated and its restriction map elucidated. No similarity with other previously cloned DNA fragments has been found. The anti-SL crossreacting polypeptide was isolated from recombinant Escherichia coli and found to have a mol mass of 37,000 Da and to possess low levels of CMCase and Avicelase activity. Using CMC as the substrate, a temperature optimum of 55 degrees C and a pH optimum of 6.6 were observed. These properties were compared to those of C. thermocellum SL isolated by electroelution from an SDS gel, which was also found to possess low levels of CMCase and Avicelase activities. In addition, the SL proteins produced in C. thermocellum and E. coli were able to interact positively against Avicel with an endoglucanase (Ss) purified from the C. thermocellum crude cellulase preparation, and with a recombinant protein that crossreacted with anti-Ss antibodies.
TI  - [Cellobiohydrolase from Clostridium thermocellum, synthesized by a recombinant E. coli strain].
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase was isolated in preparative amounts from the recombinant strain of E. coli K12 C600 carrying plasmid pCU 304 with a C. thermocellum chromosomal DNA insertion. The isolation procedure included chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 44, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, rechromatography on Ultrogel and FPLC on Mono Q resulting in a 17.6% yield and 1530-fold purification. According to data from sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under nondenaturing conditions and analytical gel isoelectrofocusing, the enzyme preparation contains only one active protein band with Mr 56.2 +/- 1.0 kDa and pI 4.15. The enzyme does not reduce the viscosity of the CM-cellulose solution but forms reducing sugars from this soluble substrate. Cellobiose (93-97%) is the major component produced by the enzyme from crystalline and amorphous cellulose (specific activity 2.3 x 10(-3) and 2.8 x 10(-2) U/mg, respectively). The activity optimum of the enzyme is at pH 5.6, 60 degrees C. The half-inactivation time at 60 degrees C and 65 degrees C is 450 and 15.5 min, respectively. The action pattern of the enzyme on the low molecular fluorogenic cellooligosaccharides suggests that the enzyme pertains to typical cellobiohydrolases.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330.
AB  - The gene encoding an acid endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330 was cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The recombinant plasmid contained a 3.1 kb HindIII insert, 1.8 kb of which was sufficient for the expression of endoglucanase activity in E. coli HB101. Nucleotide sequencing of this region (1816 bp) revealed an open reading frame of 1389 bp. The protein deduced from this sequence was composed of 463 amino acids with an Mr of 51882. The deduced amino acid sequence from amino acids 56 through 75 coincided with the amino-terminal sequence of the endoglucanase, Endo-K, purified from culture of Bacillus sp. KSM-330. The deduced amino acid sequence of Endo-K had 30% homology with that of the celA enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum NCIB 10682 and 25% homology with that of the enzyme from Cellulomonas uda CB4. However, the Endo-K protein exhibited no homology with respect to either the nucleotide or the amino acid sequences of other endoglucanases from Bacillus that had been previously characterized. These results indicate that the gene for Endo-K in Bacillus sp. KSM-330 has evolved from an ancestral gene distinct from that of other Bacillus endoglucanases.
TI  - Structure of the beta-glucosidase gene bglA of Clostridium thermocellum. Sequence analysis reveals a superfamily of cellulases and beta-glycosidases including human lactase/phlorizin hydrolase.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum gene bglA, coding for the thermostable beta-glucosidase A, has been determined. The coding region of 1344 bp was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid squence of recombinant beta-glucosidase A purified from Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to a protein of 51,482 Da. The coding region is flanked by putative promoter and transcription terminator sequences. The protein is unrelated to beta-glucosidase B of C. thermocellum, but has a high level of similarity with other bacterial beta-glucosidases and phospho-beta-glucosidases. Similarity is also observed with the beta-galactosidase of the archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus. Unexpectedly, it was found that human lactase-phlorizin hydrolase contains three copies of a sequence closely related to C. thermocellum beta-glucosidase A (up to 40% sequence identity). These diverse beta-glucosidases can therefore be grouped into an enzyme family (BGA) of common structural design. Sequence comparison by hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed that all BGA enzymes share a well conserved region which is homologous to the catalytic domain of the widely distributed cellulase family A. A distinctive feature of this domain is the sequence motif His-Asn-Glu-Pro in which the catalytic residues His and Glu are separated by 35-55 amino acid residues. The cellulase family A and the beta-glucosidase family BGA might thus be considered as members of a protein super-family comprising beta-glucanases and beta-glycosidases from all three primary kingdoms of living organisms.
TI  - Identification of a histidyl residue in the active center of endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Diethylpyrocarbonate modification of endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum, cloned in Escherichia coli, resulted in a rapid but partial (maximally 70-80%) loss of activity. The second-order rate constant of inactivation proved to be exceptionally high (3210 M-1.min-1). A 3-fold reduction of the kcat and a 2-fold increase of the Km for 2'-chloro-4'-nitrophenyl beta-cellobioside were observed. Spectrophotometric analysis indicate the presence of one rapidly (k = 0.45 min-1) and two slower (k = 0.23 min-1) reacting histidyl residues. In the presence of 50 mM methyl beta-cellotrioside, the rate of inactivation was reduced 16-fold, and the kinetics of modification were compatible with the protection of 1 histidyl residue. Since peptide analysis was inconclusive, identification of the critical residue was attempted by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the 12 histidyl residues present in the endoglucanase D sequence was mutated into either Ala or Ser. Seven of the mutant enzymes had specific activities lower than 50% of the wild-type. Only in the case of the Ser-516 mutant, however, was the residual activity not affected by diethyl pyrocarbonate. These findings suggest an important functional or structural role for His-516 in the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - Properties of a thermoactive beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) from Clostridium  thermocellum expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A Clostridium thermocellum gene (licB) encoding a thermoactive 1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase (lichenase) with a molecular weight of about 35,000 was localized on a 1.5-kb DNA fragment by cloning and expression in E. coli. The enzyme acts on beta-glucans with alternating beta-1,3- and beta-1,4-linkages such as barley beta-glucan and lichenan, but not on beta-glucans containing only 1,3- or 1,4-glucosidic bonds. It is active over a broad pH range (pH 5-12) and has a temperature optimum around 80 degrees C. The C. thermocellum lichenase is unusually resistant against inactivation by heat, ethanol or ionic detergents. These properties make the enzyme highly suitable for industrial application in the mashing process of beer brewing.
TI  - High activity of inclusion bodies formed in Escherichia coli overproducing Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase D.
AB  - The formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by Escherichia coli overproducing Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase D (EGD) was investigated. EGD was found in inclusion bodies as a 68 kDa form, whereas the size of the cytoplasmic form was 65 kDa. Upon solubilization with urea followed by dialysis, the 68 kDa form was converted to the 65 kDa species. Proteolysis occurred within the COOH-terminal, reiterated region of the 68 kDa form, which is conserved among most C. thermocellum endoglucanases, but is not required for catalytic activity. The specific activity of the enzyme embedded in inclusion bodies was close to that of the purified protein. Thus, inclusion body formation does not involve denaturation of the catalytic domain of EGD, but, more likely, the participation of the reiterated, conserved region in intermolecular interactions.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of celC307 encoding endoglucanase C307 of Clostridium sp. strain F1.
AB  - The celC gene, encoding endoglucanase C, of Clostridium thermocellum was recently sequenced while a promoter region was not identified. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of celC307 of Clostridium sp. strain F1 was identified and compared with that of the C. thermocellum gene. The open reading frame was composed of 1029 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a protein of a molecular weight of 40,905. We identified promoter sequences (TGGACA and TATAAT) at a position about 150 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. Six substitutions were found in the coding region, 3 leading to amino acid replacements. Five substitutions and 1 deletion of a nucleotide were found in the region upstream of the initiation codon, 1 present at the promoter sequence. Overproduction of endoglucanase C307 (EGC307) in Escherichia coli strongly inhibited the cell growth of the host strain. Around 50% of EGC307 produced in E. coli was detected in the periplasmic fraction. The N-terminal amino acid sequence suggested that this protein was exported into the periplasm without processing of a signal peptide.
TI  - [Isolation and certain properties of the thermostable endoglucanase from E. coli  C600 (pKNE-102) coded by a Clostridium thermocellum gene].
AB  - A previously unknown endoglucanase encoded by the C. thermocellum gene was isolated from the recombinant strain of E. coli (pKNE-102). The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation, heat treatment, chromatography on a polyvinyl matrix (Toyopearl HW-50F) and chromatofocusing on a high performance Mono P HR 5/20 column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis analysis of the Toyopearl HW-50F effluent revealed two protein bands with Mr of 41 kDa and 42 kDa. These protein components differed also by their pI values (4.45, and 4.40, respectively) and could be separated by chromatofocusing. Both components were found to be active and exhibited similar enzymatic properties as well as high thermal stability.
TI  - Sequencing and expression of a cellodextrinase (ced1) gene from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.314 kb DNA segment containing a gene (ced1) expressing cellodextrinase activity from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was determined. The B. fibrisolvens H17c gene was expressed from a weak internal promoter in Escherichia coli and a putative consensus promoter sequence was identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and a GTG start codon. The complete amino acid sequence (547 residues) was deduced and homology was demonstrated with the Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase D (EGD), Pseudomonas fluorescens var. cellulosa endoglucanase (EG), and a cellulase from the avocado fruit (Persea americana). The ced1 gene product Ced1 showed cellodextrinase activity and rapidly hydrolysed short-chain cellodextrins to yield either cellobiose or cellobiose and glucose as end products. The Ced1 enzyme released cellobiose from p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside and the enzyme was not inhibited by methylcellulose, an inhibitor of endoglucanase activity. Although the major activity of the Ced1 enzyme was that of a cellodextrinase it also showed limited activity against endoglucanase specific substrates [carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), lichenan, laminarin and xylan]. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with incorporated CMC showed a major activity band with an apparent Mr of approximately 61,000. The calculated Mr of the ced1 gene product was 61,023.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the Clostridium stercorarium celZ gene encoding a thermoactive cellulase (Avicelase I): identification of catalytic and cellulose-binding domains.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the celZ gene coding for a thermostable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (Avicelase I) of Clostridium stercorarium was determined. The structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 2958 bp which encodes a preprotein of 986 amino acids with an Mr of 109,000. The signal peptide cleavage site was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of Avicelase I purified from C. stercorarium culture supernatants. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli is proteolytically cleaved into catalytic and cellulose-binding fragments of about 50 kDa each. Sequence comparison revealed that the N-terminal half of Avicelase I is closely related to avocado (Persea americana) cellulase. Homology is also observed with Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase D and Pseudomonas fluorescens cellulase. The cellulose-binding region was located in the C-terminal half of Avicelase I. It consists of a reiterated domain of 88 amino acids flanked by a repeated sequence about 140 amino acids in length. The C-terminal flanking sequence is highly homologous to the non-catalytic domain of Bacillus subtilis endoglucanase and Caldocellum saccharolyticum endoglucanase B. It is proposed that the enhanced cellulolytic activity of Avicelase I is due to the presence of multiple cellulose-binding sites.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Ruminococcus albus SY3 endoglucanase genes celA and celB.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Ruminococcus albus genes celA and celB coding for endoglucanase A (EGA) and endoglucanase B (EGB), respectively, have been determined. The celA structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1095 bp. Confirmation of the nucleotide sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by N-terminal analysis of purified EGA. The celB structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1227 bp; 7 bp upstream of the translational start codon of celB is a typical gram-positive Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The deduced N-terminal region of EGB conforms to the general pattern for the signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. The complete celB gene, cloned into pUC vectors, caused lethality in Escherichia coli. In contrast, celA cloned in pUC18, under the control of lacZp, directed high-level synthesis of EGA in E. coli JM83. EGA in cell-free extract, purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, had a Mr of 44.5 kDa. Gene deletion and subcloning studies with celA revealed that EGA hydrolysed both CMC and xylan, and did not contain discrete functional domains. EGA and EGB showed considerable homology with each other, in addition to exhibiting similarity with Eg1 (R. albus), EGE (Clostridium thermocellum) and End (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens).
TI  - Multiple endo-beta-1,4-glucanase-encoding genes from Bacillus lautus PL236 and characterization of the celB gene.
AB  - A Bacillus lautus strain was isolated from compost by its ability to degrade microcrystalline Avicel cellulose and acid-swollen cellulose. Three DNA fragments cloned in Escherichia coli encoded at least four endo-beta-1,4-glucanases (EG), of which at least two were contained on one DNA fragment. Another fragment, of 2.5 kb and carrying celB, was cloned in the shuttle-vector plasmid, pJKK3-1, and expressed in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. The fragment was sequenced and shown to encode a 62-kDa protein, which was found as a 56-kDa mature and active EG in extracts of E. coli and in the supernatant of B. subtilis. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence has a homology of 37% identical aa on a stretch of 295 aa to EG-E of Clostridium thermocellum. A low level of homology is detected with the Bacillus-type EG.
TI  - Endoglucanase E, produced at high level in Escherichia coli as a lacZ' fusion protein, is part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  - The Clostridium thermocellum celE gene was expressed at high level in Escherichia coli TG1 when placed under the transcriptional and translational control of lacZ' in pUC18; in the presence of a multicopy plasmid (pNM52) containing the lacIq gene, expression of full-length and truncated forms of celE was regulated by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Catalytically active endoglucanase E (EGE) produced by E. coli was subject to proteolytic processing. The main protein species produced from full-length and truncated forms of celE was around 40 kDa in size and had an N-terminal amino acid sequence corresponding to that derived for mature EGE from the nucleotide sequence; in addition, larger species of about 75 kDa, presumably corresponding to full-size EGE, were produced by E. coli containing the full-length celE gene. Even after removal of the signal peptide sequence, EGE produced by E. coli was secreted into the periplasm. Up to 157 bp could be deleted from the 5' end of the celE gene without affecting the catalytic activity of EGE produced by E. coli. A polypeptide of Mr 86 kDa, immunoreactive with anti-EGE antiserum, was demonstrated in the high-molecular-weight, cellulose-binding multiprotein aggregate recoverable from C. thermocellum culture supernatant.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and analysis of expression of a Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens gene encoding a beta-glucosidase.
AB  - The cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3.74 kb DNA segment on pLS215 containing a beta-glucosidase gene (bglA) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was investigated. The B. fibrisolvens bglA open reading frame (ORF) of 2490 bp encoded a beta-glucosidase of 830 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 91,800. In Escherichia coli C600(pLS215) cells the beta-glucosidase was localized in the cytoplasm and these cells produced an additional protein with an apparent Mr of approximately 94,000. The bglA gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in E. coli and a single mRNA initiation point was identified upstream of the bglA ORF and adjacent to a promoter consensus sequence. The primary structure of the beta-glucosidase showed greater than 40% similarity with a domain of 237 amino acids present in the beta-glucosidases of Kluyveromyces fragilis and Clostridium thermocellum. The B. fibrisolvens beta-glucosidase hydrolysed cellobiose to a limited extent, cellotriose to cellobiose and glucose, and cellotetraose and cellopentaose to predominantly glucose.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of Clostridium thermocellum F7 endoglucanase gene in gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The endoglucanase gene of Clostridium thermocellum F7 was cloned in Escherichia coli cells using pKM4 vector. Both the physical mapping and analysis of the gene products in the E. coli mini-cells system suggest cloning of a new cel gene different from those described earlier. The activity of endoglucanase in E. coli cells is localized in the periplasm, which correlates with secretion of enzymes of this type in C. thermicellum. Apart from 2 major components with Mr 42.5 and 43 kDa, corresponding to mature protein forms, we observed the formation of minor products of various electrophoretic motilities. Cloning of the endoglucanase gene on bhr vector pBS954 controlled by its own regulatory signal yielded high level of the endoglucanase activity in the recombinant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Erwinia carotovora comparable with the level of the gene expression in E. coli cells.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of Clostridium thermocellum F7 cellulase genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells].
AB  - The Clostridium thermocellum total DNA Sau 3A fragments' library was constructed  on the basis of shuttle vector pMK4 for the Escherichia coli - Bacillus subtilis. 14 clones with endoglucanase activity and one with beta-glucosidase activity were selected in E. coli cells. Recombinant plasmids pCE were characterized by structural instability of various degree in B. subtilis cells. The results of the physical mapping, analysis of gene products in E. coli mini-cells as well as the DNA-DNA blot hybridization have led to conclusion on cloning of 7 individual genes for endoglucanases. Up to 3 polypeptides of various molecular weight corresponding to the products of cel gene were revealed in E. coli mini-cells containing the recombinant plasmids. The hybridization analysis demonstrated considerable homology of the majority of cel genes.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a Bacteroides ruminicola B(1)4 endoglucanase gene.
AB  - Bacteroides ruminicola B(1)4, a noncellulolytic rumen bacterium, produces an endoglucanase (carboxymethylcellulase [CMCase]) that is excreted into the culture supernatant. Cultures grown on glucose, fructose, maltose, mannose, and cellobiose had high specific activities of CMCase (greater than 3 mmol of reducing sugar per mg of protein per min), but its synthesis was repressed by sucrose. B. rumincola did not grow on either ball-milled or acid-swollen cellulose even though the CMCase could hydrolyze swollen cellulose. The CMCase gene was cloned into Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for a protein of 40,481 daltons. The enzyme was overproduced in E. coli under the control of the tac promoter and purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and molecular weight of the purified enzyme were similar to the values predicted from the open reading frame of the DNA sequence. However, the CMCase present in B. ruminicola was found to have a monomer molecular weight of 88,000 by Western immunoblotting. This discrepancy appeared to have resulted from our having cloned only part of the CMCase gene into E. coli. The amino acid sequence of the CMCase showed homology to sequences of beta-glucanases from Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum.
TI  - DNA sequence of a Fibrobacter succinogenes mixed-linkage beta-glucanase (1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase) gene.
AB  - The DNA sequence of a mixed-linkage beta-glucanase (1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.73]) gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes cloned in Escherichia coli was determined. The general features of this gene are very similar to the consensus features for other gram-negative bacterial genes. The gene product was processed for export in E. coli. There is a high level of sequence homology between the structure of this glucanase and the structure of a mixed-linkage beta-glucanase from Bacillus subtilis. The nonhomologous region of the amino acid sequence includes a serine-rich region containing five repeats of the sequence Pro-Xxx-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser-(Ala or Val) which may be functionally related to the serine-rich region observed in Pseudomonas fluorescens cellulase and the serine- and/or threonine-rich regions observed in Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase and exoglucanase, in Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases A and B, and in Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, cellobiohydrolase II, and endoglucanase I.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Clostridium thermocellum genes coding for thermostable  exoglucanases (cellobiohydrolases) in Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - By special screening approach two independent Cl. thermocellum genes directing the synthesis of thermostable glucanases with an exo-mode of action have been isolated from pUC19-based gene bank in E. coli TG1. The genes are located on 3.4 and 11.3 kb DNA fragments showing no homology. E. coli-derived exoglucanases, presumably, cellobiohydrolases, are able to cleave lichenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, xylan and p-nitrophenyl derivatives of cellobioside and lactoside. Cellobiose is the main degradation product of carboxymethyl cellulose, treated with the identified exoglucanases. With p-nitrophenil-beta-D-cellobioside as substrate the enzymes had a pH optimum around 6.5 and a temperature optimum at 65 degrees C. The identified and expressed enzymes differ from all other Cl. thermocellum proteins known to date.
TI  - [Various kinetic properties of beta-glucosidase cloned from Clostridium thermocellum in E. coli].
AB  - The kinetics of pNPG, pNPX and cellobiose hydrolysis by beta-glucosidase cloned from C. thermocellum into E. coli was studied. The V values for these substrate hydrolysis are 102, 357 and 6.7 mumols/min/mg protein, respectively; Km are 0.44 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM, respectively, sigma-Gluconolactone inhibits the hydrolysis of all substrates according to a competitive mechanism with Ki of 0.032 mM, 6.0 mM and 0.25 mM, respectively. Glucose inhibits the hydrolysis of pNPG and pNPX also via a competitive mechanism with Ki of 10 mM and 37 mM, while cellobiose--via a mixed type mechanism with Ki of 110 mM and 350 mM. The existence of separate adsorption sites for each substrate and of a common catalytic site for pNPG and pNPX hydrolysis is supposed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and deletion analysis of the cellulase-encoding gene celH of  Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the celH gene of Clostridium thermocellum was determined. The open reading frame extended over 2.7-kb DNA fragment and encoded a 900-amino acid (aa) protein (Mr 102,301) which hydrolyzes carboxymethylcellulose, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside, methylumbelliferyl- beta-D-cellobioside, barley beta-glucan, and larchwood xylan. The N terminus showed a typical signal peptide, and a cleavage site after Ser44 was predicted. Two Pro-Thr-Ser-rich regions divided the protein into three approximately equal domains. The central 328-aa region was similar to the N-terminal part, carrying the active site, of C. thermocellum endoglucanase E (EGE; 30.2%). The C-terminal region ended with two conserved 24-aa stretches showing close similarity with those previously described in EGA, EGB, EGD, EGE, EGX, and xylanase from C. thermocellum. Deletions of celH removing up to 327 codons from the 5' end and up to 245 codons from the 3' end of the coding sequence did not affect enzyme activity, confirming that the central domain was indeed responsible for catalytic activity. Production of truncated EGH in Escherichia coli was increased up to 120-fold by fusing fragments containing the 3' portion of the gene with the start of lacZ' present in pTZ19R.
TI  - Cloning of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Six independent and distinct cel genes coding endoglucanases have been selected from C. thermocellum pUC19-based gene bank in E. coli TG1. E. coli-derived Cel-proteins possessing Mr from 39,000 to 61,000 are able to cleave lichenan, as well as xylan and carboxymethyl cellulose. Cel 7- and Cel 8-endoglucanases are characterized by cellobiohydrolase type substrate specificity, being able to cleave model fluorogenic aryldisaccharide substrate MU-G2. The clone pCU110 (cel 7) produces about 10-fold more endoglucanase activity than other clones.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of endo-beta-1,4-glucanase genes from Bacillus polymyxa and Bacillus circulans.
AB  - Endo-beta-1,4-glucanase genes from Bacillus circulans and from B. polymyxa were cloned by direct expression by using bacteriophage M13mp9 as the vector. The enzymatic activity of the gene products was detected by using either the Congo red assay or hydroxyethyl cellulose dyed with Ostazin Brilliant Red H-3B. The B. circulans and B. subtilis PAP115 endo-beta-1,4-glucanase genes were shown to be homologous by the use of restriction endonuclease site mapping, DNA-DNA hybridization, S1 nuclease digestion after heteroduplex formation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein products. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of 3.1 kilobase pairs of cloned B. polymyxa DNA revealed two convergently transcribed open reading frames (ORFs) consisting of 398 codons (endoglucanase) and 187 codons (ORF2) and separated by 374 nucleotides. The coding region of the B. polymyxa endoglucanase gene would theoretically produce a 44-kilodalton preprotein. Expression of the B. polymyxa endoglucanase in Escherichia coli was due to a fusion of the endoglucanase gene at codon 30 with codon 9 of the lacZ alpha-peptide gene. The B. polymyxa endoglucanase has 34% amino acid similarity to the Clostridium thermocellum celB endoglucanase sequence but very little similarity to endoglucanases from other Bacillus species. ORF2 has 28% amino acid similarity to the NH2-terminal half of the E. coli lac repressor protein, which is responsible for DNA binding.
TI  - Identification and nucleotide sequence of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus encoded trpE gene.
AB  - The trpE gene from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus encoding the anthranilate synthase component I was cloned, identified by deletion analysis and sequenced. It encodes a predicted polypeptide of 497 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 55,323. Its primary structure shows 49% identical amino acids with the enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum, 45% with that of Thermus thermophilus and only 35% with that of Escherichia coli. The codon usage of the trpE genes encoding the most homologous enzymes differs greatly indicating selection for amino acid maintainance. The homologies are clustered in the C-terminal 200 amino acids of the sequences indicating that this part is important for enzymic activity.
TI  - Structure of a Ruminococcus albus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase gene.
AB  - A chromosomal DNA fragment encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase I (Eg I) gene from Ruminococcus albus cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli with pUC18 was fully sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method. The sequence contained a consensus promoter sequence and a structural amino acid sequence. The initial 43 amino acids of the protein were deduced to be a signal sequence, since they are missing in the mature protein (Eg I). High homology was found when the amino acid sequence of the Eg I was compared with that of endoglucanase E from Clostridium thermocellum. Codon usage of the gene was not biased. These results suggested that the properties of the Eg I gene from R. albus was specified from the known beta-glucanase genes of the other organisms.
TI  - Structure of the cel-3 gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and characteristics of the encoded gene product, endoglucanase 3.
AB  - The cel-3 gene cloned from Fibrobacter succinogenes into Escherichia coli coded for the enzyme EG3, which exhibited both endoglucanase and cellobiosidase activities. The gene had an open reading frame of 1,974 base pairs, coding for a protein of 73.4 kilodaltons (kDa). However, the enzyme purified from the osmotic shock fluid of E. coli was 43 kDa. The amino terminus of the 43-kDa protein matched amino acid residue 266 of the protein coded for by the open reading frame, indicating proteolysis in E. coli. In addition to the 43-kDa protein, Western immunoblotting revealed a 94-kDa membranous form of the enzyme in E. coli and a single protein of 118 kDa in F. succinogenes. Thus, the purified protein appears to be a proteolytic degradation product of a native protein which was 94 kDa in E. coli and 118 kDa in F. succinogenes. The discrepancy between the molecular weight expected on the basis of the DNA sequence and the in vivo form may be due to anomalous migration during electrophoresis, to glycosylation of the native enzyme, or to fatty acyl substitution at the N terminus. One of two putative signal peptide cleavage sites bore a strong resemblance to known lipoprotein leader sequences. The purified 43-kDa peptide exhibited a high Km (53 mg/ml) for carboxymethyl cellulose but a low Km (3 to 4 mg/ml) for lichenan and barley beta-glucan. The enzyme hydrolyzed amorphous cellulose, and cellobiose and cellotriose were the major products of hydrolysis. Cellotriose, but not cellobiose, was cleaved by the enzyme. EG3 exhibited significant amino acid sequence homology with endoglucanase CelC from Clostridium thermocellum, and as with both CelA and CelC of C. thermocellum, it had a putative active site which could be aligned with the active site of hen egg white lysozyme at the highly conserved amino acid residues Asn-44 and Asp-52.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of an endoglucanase (end1) gene from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.8 kb DNA segment containing an endoglucanase gene  (end1) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was determined. The B. fibrisolvens H17c gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in Escherichia coli and three putative consensus promoter sequences were identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and an ATG start codon. The complete amino acid sequence (547 residues) was deduced and homology with the Clostridium thermocellum celE gene product (EGE) was demonstrated. The endoglucanase contained a typical amino-terminal signal sequence and five repeated sequences (PDPTPVD) between amino acids 412-447. The endoglucanase showed relatively high endoglucanase activity against endoglucanase-specific substrates with beta 1-4 linkages but low activity against xylan and an exoglucanase-specific substrate, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside.
TI  - Integration and expression of alpha-amylase and endoglucanase genes in the Lactobacillus plantarum chromosome.
AB  - A commercial grass silage starter strain of Lactobacillus plantarum was transformed by high-frequency electroporation with plasmids containing an alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus stearothermophilus and an endoglucanase gene from Clostridium thermocellum. Both genes were expressed from their native regulatory signals, and active enzymes were found in the supernatant. However, the segregational stability of the transforming plasmids was rather low. Therefore, the transforming genes were inserted in the L. plantarum chromosome by means of single homologous recombination. In the majority of the transformants, this led to extremely stable segregation and expression of the transforming genes, without generating secondary mutations in the host. Increased selective pressure led to tandem amplification of the transforming DNA. The transformed strains demonstrated the ability of L. plantarum to express heterologous gene products; they can be used to detect the inoculum in silage ecology studies; and they demonstrate the feasibility of engineering truly cellulolytic silage starter bacteria.
TI  - Addition of cloned beta-glucosidase enhances the degradation of crystalline cellulose by the Clostridium thermocellum cellulose complex.
AB  - A thermostable beta-glucosidase from Clostridium thermocellum which is expressed  in Escherichia coli was used to determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme. A restriction map of the beta-glucosidase gene cloned in plasmid pALD7 was determined. Addition of the E. coli cell extract (containing the beta-glucosidase) to the cellulase complex from C. thermocellum increased the conversion of crystalline cellulose (Avicel) to glucose. The increase was specifically due to hydrolysis of the accumulated cellobiose. A cellulose degradation process using beta-glucosidase to assist the potent cellulase complex of C. thermocellum, as shown here can open the way for industrial saccharification of cellulose to glucose.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum bgIB gene encoding thermostable beta-glucosidase B: homology to fungal beta-glucosidases.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the bglB gene, coding for the thermostable beta-glucosidase B of Clostridium thermocellum was determined. The coding region of 2265 bp was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of beta-glucosidase B purified from Escherichia coli. The derived amino acid sequence corresponding to a polypeptide of Mr 84,100 was confirmed by sequencing of the C-terminal peptide generated by cleavage with cyanogen bromide. The protein bears no resemblance to other bacterial beta-glucosidase sequences. However, extensive regions of homology were identified between the C. thermocellum enzyme and fungal beta-glucosidases. The N-terminal homologous region contains an amino acid sequence very similar to the active site of beta-glucosidase A3 from Aspergillus wentii. The striking sequence similarities between C. thermocellum beta-glucosidase B and Kluyveromyces fragilis beta-glucosidase suggest the possibility of a genetic exchange between thermophilic anaerobic bacteria and yeasts.
TI  - Molecular cloning and the nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum trpE gene.
AB  - The trpE gene of Clostridium thermocellum, a moderately thermophilic and absolutely anaerobic bacterium, was cloned by its ability to complement growth of an Escherichia coli tryptophan auxotroph (trpE) deficient in anthranilate synthase I. The nucleotide sequence of trpE and its flanking region was determined. The trpE gene overlapped at the termination codon with a putative initiation codon of trpG (trp[G]D), as deduced from the amino acid sequence homology with anthranilate synthase II of Serratia marcescens. S1-nuclease mapping of the trpE transcript produced in E. coli cells suggested that the promoter of C. thermocellum was utilized by E. coli. The amino acid sequence of anthranilate synthase I of C. thermocellum predicted from the nucleotide sequence is more similar to that of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8, than that of mesophilic bacteria.
TI  - [A new type of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase produced by the recombinant strain of E. coli. Some properties and identification in donor cells].
AB  - The properties of endoglucanase produced by the recombinant strain of E. coli carrying plasmid pCU 104 with a 2.9 kb insert of chromosomal DNA of C. thermocellum encoding the multiple forms of the 35.5 kD polypeptide (pI 4.3-4.7) were studied. The enzyme has a broad pH optimum of activity (6.0-7.5). The half-inactivation time for different forms of the enzyme at 65 degrees C is similar and is equal to 25-30 minutes. The enzyme is related to endoglucanases weakly adsorbed on cellulose (Kp = 0.065 1/g). Hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose is completed within 7 days (7-9%) and is accompanied by the formation of cellobiose and cellotriose. The enzyme splits dyed lichenan (mixed 1,3-1,4-beta-glucane) at a higher rate than the dyed CM-cellulose. A guinea pig antiserum to enzyme isoforms with a pI of 4.46-4.54 was obtained. Using direct solid phase immunoenzymatic analysis, it was demonstrated that all the enzyme isoforms under study (pI 4.3-4.7) are immunologically related (serum titers for different enzyme isoforms vary from 1:20,000 to 1:50,000). In the original culture fluid of C. thermocellum, the antigen related to the enzyme isolated from the recombinant strain was unobserved. However, SDS-PAAG electrophoresis of SDS- and mercaptoethanol-treated culture fluids revealed among 11 protein bands at least 4 antigens interacting with antibodies (Mr = 107, 76, 67 and 37 kD), although their antibody titers were far lower and did not exceed 1:300-1:500. The cumulative data suggest that the endoglucanase under study is not identical to the earlier described enzymes encoded by the cel A- and ceI B-genes of C. thermocellum.
TI  - Identification of three distinct Clostridium thermocellum xylanase genes by molecular cloning.
AB  - Three genes coding for xylanase synthesis in Clostridium thermocellum were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Genomic DNA from Clostridium thermocellum was digested to completion with HindIII, BamHI, and SalI. The fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of pUC19 and transformed into Escherichia coli. Two of the genes encoded for xylanases which depolymerized xylans but were unable to extensively convert these substrates to reducing sugar. The third gene encoded for an enzyme that extensively hydrolyzed xylan. The insert containing the latter gene was subjected to extensive mapping and was found to encode for a xylanase with a molecular weight of approximately 25,000. The protein product of the cloned gene was obtained in a relatively pure form by heat treatment, ion exchange and gel permeation steps. The enzyme was quite stable to high temperatures with a half-life of 24 h at 70 degrees C.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and deletion analysis of the xylanase gene (xynZ) of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the xynZ gene, encoding the extracellular xylanase Z of Clostridium thermocellum, was determined. The putative xynZ gene was 2,511 base pairs long and encoded a polypeptide of 837 amino acids. A region of 60 amino acids containing a duplicated segment of 24 amino acids was found between residues 429 and 488 of xylanase Z. This region was strongly similar to the conserved domain found at the carboxy-terminal ends of C. thermocellum endoglucanases A, B, and D. Deletions removing up to 508 codons from the 5' end of the gene did not affect the activity of the encoded polypeptide, showing that the active site was located in the C-terminal half of the protein and that the conserved region was not involved in catalysis. Expression of xylanase activity in Escherichia coli was increased up to 220-fold by fusing fragments containing the 3' end of the gene with the start of lacZ present in pUC19. An internal translational initiation site which was efficiently recognized in E. coli was tentatively identified 470 codons downstream from the actual start codon.
TI  - Purification of Clostridium thermocellum xylanase Z expressed in Escherichia coli and identification of the corresponding product in the culture medium of C. thermocellum.
AB  - An endoxylanase encoded by the xynZ gene of Clostridium thermocellum was purified from Escherichia coli harbouring a fragment of the gene cloned in pUC8. The purified enzyme showed two active bands of Mr 41,000 and 39,000, the latter one presumably derived from the former through proteolysis. The enzyme was highly active on xylan and para-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylobioside. The major end product of xylan hydrolysis was xylobiose. With an antiserum raised against the enzyme purified from E. coli, an immunoreactive polypeptide of Mr 90,000, corresponding to the entire xynZ gene product, was detected in a culture supernatant from C. thermocellum grown on cellulose. By immunological detection, xylanase Z was shown to be associated with a cellulose-binding, high-molecular-weight fraction whose properties coincided with those described previously for the cellulose-degrading complex of C. thermocellum known as the cellulosome.
TI  - Conserved reiterated domains in Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases are not essential for catalytic activity.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum celE gene, coding for an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (endoglucanase E; EGE) with xylan-hydrolysing activity has been determined. The structural gene consists of an open reading frame (ORF) of 2442 bp commencing with a GTG start codon and followed by a TAA stop codon. The nucleotide sequence obtained has been confirmed by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein. The EGE sequence contains a region homologous to the reiterated domain found at the C terminus of other endoglucanases from the same organism. BAL 31 deletions of the structural gene have revealed the extent to which this conserved sequence is necessary for endoglucanase and xylanase activity. A region of DNA, upstream from the structural gene has also been sequenced and a ribosome-binding site and putative promoter sequences have been identified. A second ORF which ends 349 bp 5' to the GTG start codon of the celE gene has also been identified. The encoded product contains a C terminus homologous to other C. thermocellum endoglucanases.
TI  - Cloning and expression of two cellulase genes of Clostridium cellulolyticum in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Two cellulase genes isolated from Clostridium cellulolyticum strain ATCC3519 were cloned in Escherichia coli using plasmid pACYC184. Plasmids pB52 and pB43 were isolated from the transformants producing carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and the two cloned CMCase-coding genes were found to be included in two EcoRI fragments of 5.7 kb and 2.6 kb, respectively. These two genes showed no homology. The CMCase-coding genes were found to be contained in a 1.8-kb KpnI-HindIII fragment and a 2.05-kb HindIII-PvuII fragment of the DNA donor strain. Expression of these genes in E. coli was found not to depend on their orientation in the cloning vector. Hybridization experiments between these two fragments and Clostridium thermocellum NCIB10682 DNA fragments carrying genes celA, celB, celC and celD were carried out and some homologies were detected.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the celC gene encoding endoglucanase C of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the cellulase gene celC, encoding endoglucanase C of Clostridium thermocellum, has been determined. The coding region of 1032 bp was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence of endoglucanase C purified from Escherichia coli. The ATG start codon is preceded by an AGGAGG sequence typical of ribosome-binding sites in Gram-positive bacteria. The derived amino acid sequence corresponds to a protein of Mr 40,439. Amino acid analysis and apparent Mr of endoglucanase C are consistent with the amino acid sequence as derived from the DNA sequencing data. A proposed N-terminal 21-aa residue leader (signal) sequence differs from other prokaryotic signal peptides and is non-functional in E. coli. Most of the protein bears no resemblance to the endoglucanases A, B, and D of the same organism. However, a short region of homology between endoglucanases A and C was identified, which is similar to the established active sites of lysozymes and to related sequences of fungal cellulases.
TI  - The cloned cel (cellulose degradation) genes of Clostridium thermocellum and their products.
AB  - More than 10 cel genes of Clostridium thermocellum were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Four of them, celA, celB, celC and celD, were studied in detail. The corresponding endoglucanases were purified from E. coli and characterized. The over-produced endoglucanase D, purified from cytoplasmic granules, was crystallized.
TI  - Synthesis and secretion of a heat-stable carboxymethylcellulose from Clostridium  thermocellum in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus.
AB  - The cellulase gene celA of Clostridium thermocellum coding for the thermostable endoglucanase A was transferred from Escherichia coli to Bacillus subtilis 168 and B. stearothermophilus CU21 using plasmids derived from the Bacillus vector pUB110. When the structural part of the gene was joined to a pUB110 promoter the recombinant plasmids (pSE102, pSE105) were stably maintained and expressed carboxymethylcellulose (CMCase) activity. In B. stearothermophilus CU21 (pSE105) the clostridial CMCase was produced over a wide temperature range up to the maximal growth temperature (68 degrees C). In contrast to E. coli, all of the CMCase synthesized in bacilli was released into the culture medium. About 50% of the extracellular protein secreted by B. subtilis 168 (pSE102) carrying the celA gene consisted of endoglucanase A. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of producing cellulolytic enzymes from thermophilic anaerobes in bacilli.
TI  - Molecular cloning of Clostridium thermocellum DNA and the expression of further novel endo-beta-1,4-glucanase genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Sau3A fragments of Clostridium thermocellum (NCIB 10682) DNA were ligated into the BamHI site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 and a Lac- mutant thereof. Twenty-eight clones with carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) activity were selected from two libraries by means of the Congo Red plate assay. Restriction enzyme analysis indicated that the CMCase+ clones contained a total of 13 unique DNA inserts. Hybridization of recombinant plasmids with chromosomal DNA confirmed the physical maps in all but one case and was further used to demonstrate the absence of homology between the HindIII restriction fragments of similar size which occurred in many of the clones. Without exception, CMCase+ E. coli clones expressed endoglucanase activity, but differed with respect to the amount and nature of the enzyme activity produced; additionally, some clones had exoglucanase activity which, in at least one case, was not attributable to the production of a second enzyme. For a few selected clones, the partially purified CMCase was analysed by electrophoresis. A temperature profile characteristic of a thermostable enzyme was demonstrated for the endoglucanase of one of the most active clones. Based on the evidence presented here, it is probable that the 13 unique DNA fragments described do not contain any of the C. thermocellum endoglucanase genes previously cloned.
TI  - Structure of a Bacillus subtilis endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the portion of a Bacillus subtilis (strain PAP115) 3 kb Pst I fragment which contains an endo-beta-1, 4-glucanase gene has been determined. This gene encodes a protein of 499 amino acid residues (Mr = 55,234) with a typical B. subtilis signal peptide. Escherichia coli which has been transformed with this gene produces an extracellular endoglucanase with an amino-terminus corresponding to the thirtieth encoded amino acid residue. The gene is preceded by a cryptic reading frame with a rho-independent terminator structure, and itself has such a structure in the immediate 3'-flanking region. We have also identified, in the 5'-flanking region, nucleotide sequences which resemble promoter elements recognized by Bacillus RNA polymerase E sigma 43. Comparison of the encoded amino acid sequence to other known beta-glucanases reveals a small region of similarity to the encoded protein of the Clostridium thermocellum celB gene. These similar regions may contain substrate-binding and/or catalytic sites.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the cellulase gene celD encoding endoglucanase D of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the celD gene, encoding the previously crystallized endoglucanase D of Clostridium thermocellum, is reported. The enzyme shares a conserved, reiterated domain with the COOH-terminal end of endoglucanases A and B from the same organism. The overexpression in Escherichia coli of celD subcloned in pUC8 appears to result from a translational fusion of the NH2-terminal end of the endoglucanase with the NH2-terminal end of beta-galactosidase.
TI  - Properties of a Clostridium thermocellum Endoglucanase Produced in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A cellulase gene of Clostridium thermocellum was transferred to Escherichia coli  by molecular cloning with bacteriophage lambda and plasmid vectors and shown to be indentical with the celA gene. The celA gene product was purified from extracts of plasmid-bearing E. coli cells by heat treatment and chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl. It was characterized as a thermophilic endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, the properties of which closely resemble those of endoglucanase A previously isolated from C. thermocellum supernatants. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the enzyme purified from E. coli exhibited two protein bands with molecular weights of 49,000 and 52,000. It had a temperature optimum at 75 degrees C and was stable for several hours at 60 degrees C. Endoglucanase activity was optimal between pH 5.5 and 6.5. The enzyme was insensitive against end product inhibition by glucose and cellobiose and remarkably resistant to the denaturing effects of detergents and organic solvents. It was capable of degrading, in addition to cellulosic substrates, glucans with alternating beta-1,4 and beta-1,3 linkages such as barley beta-glucan and lichenan.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction study of an endoglucanase from  Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Endoglucanase D, a cellulose degradation enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum has been cloned in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystals are trigonal, space group P3(1)12 (or P3(2)12) with a = 57.7 (+/- 0.1) A, c = 192.1 (+/- 0.2) A, and diffract X-rays to a resolution of 2.8 A. They are suitable for a high-resolution X-ray diffraction analysis.
TI  - Purification and properties of the endoglucanase C of Clostridium thermocellum produced in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The celC gene, which codes for a new endoglucanase of Clostridium thermocellum, termed endoglucanase C, was found to be expressed when cloned in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneneity from E. coli and its biochemical properties were studied. It differs from the previously studied endoglucanases A and B. In particular, endoglucanase C displays features common to endo- and exoglucanases, since it had a high activity on carboxymethylcellulose and on p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside where only the agluconic bond was split. In addition, the enzyme was able to release cellobiose units from G3, G4 and G5 cellodextrins. Endoglucanase C was characterized by Western blot in a culture supernatant from C. thermocellum grown on cellulose, using an antiserum raised against the enzyme produced by E. coli.
TI  - Mapping of mRNA encoding endoglucanase A from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The size and location of the 5' end of celA mRNA encoding endoglucanase A of Clostridium thermocellum were investigated in C. thermocellum and in an Escherichia coli clone that carries and expresses the celA gene. In E. coli, the 5' end of celA mRNA was located 134 bp upstream from the initiation codon and 10 bp downstream from a sequence homologous to the consensus sequence of E. coli sigma 70 and Bacillus subtilis sigma 43 (formerly sigma 55) vegetative promoters. In C. thermocellum, a minor transcript appeared to start from the same site, but a major species started 57 bp upstream from the coding sequence. The 5' end of this mRNA was preceded by a sequence reminiscent of B. subtilis sigma 28 vegetative promoters. In both organisms, the size of the transcript suggested that celA belongs to a monocistronic unit of transcription.
