TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  == the microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation  to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and prevotella intermedia (15.7%). the prevalence of p. gingivalis was 91.7%, fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and b. forsythus, 53.4%. significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (p < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for p. intermedia, campylobacter concisus, selenomonas sputigena, and peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for streptococcus  sanguis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus (p < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (p < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for p. intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, and a. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for f. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.

TI  == aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  == phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium omiz-w1. none of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, selenomonas sputigena, treponema pectinovorum, t. socranskii, or wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine  methylester). phenylalanine was essential for the growth of capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium timidum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. with the exception of e. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow  when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum, selenomonas flueggei, selenomonas infelix, selenomonas noxia, and selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  == twenty-eight strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 selenomonas strains, including s. sputigena (24 strains), s. flueggei (10 strains), s. infelix (5 strains), and s. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate  with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing actinobacillus, actinomyces, bacteroides, capnocytophaga, gemella, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas, propionibacterium, rothia, streptococcus, and  veillonella species. selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with actinomyces naeslundii pk984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. in contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. each fusobacterium  strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by edta, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. heating the fusobacteria at 85  degrees c for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of  fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective.  the strains of f. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. the contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.

TI  == api zym and api an-ident reactions of fastidious oral gram-negative species.
AB  == api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests were done on six oral species  which are difficult to characterize with conventional biochemical tests. "bacteroides forsythus, the "fusiform" bacteroides species (a. c. r. tanner, m. a. listgarten, m. n. strzempko, and j. l. ebersole, manuscript in preparation), is difficult to cultivate in broth media, yet it gave 15 positive tests in these  series. the tests were able to separate this new species from species of capnocytophaga and fusobacterium. "b. forsythus" reactions were similar but not identical to those of reference bacteroides species. positive reactions for alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and alpha-glucuronidase suggest that "b. forsythus" may be saccharolytic. it was the only species tested  which was trypsin positive. wolinella species, campylobacter concisus, b. gracilis, and eikenella corrodens are asaccharolytic, and characterization relies heavily on sensitivities to inhibitory agents. these species reacted weakly in the api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests, and the reactions were not useful for separating these species. the enzyme reactions differentiated wolinella recta and c. concisus from selenomonas sputigena, another oral motile but saccharolytic organism.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  == clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. the subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on  probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. using attachment level measurements  and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. subgingival plaque samples  were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation  before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. the control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. the proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. sputigena and eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of b. intermedius and e. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga species had increased.  multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. the proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of streptococcus sanguis ii and campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. humoral antibody response to a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. sputigena significantly increased in  a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the objective of this research was to determine whether gram-negative bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites contained polyclonal b-cell activators. polyclonal b-cell activation, which results in nonspecific activation of multiple b-cell clones was analyzed by a hemolysis-in-gel assay designed to detect a broad range of antibody specificities. extracts from numerous bacterial  strains, including bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum,  selenomonas sputigena, capnocytophaga ochracea, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were tested. extracts of the above organisms were found to stimulate polyclonal antibody responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, although the magnitude of stimulation varied among the extracts. optimal antibody-forming cell responses were found at stimulator doses  between 5 and 1,000 micrograms/ml. we conclude that the resident gram-negative subgingival flora associated with periodontal lesions possesses potent polyclonal b-cell activators. these activators may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing b lymphocytes to produce antibody, osteolytic factors, or both and possibly other mediators of inflammation.

TI  == ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  == this study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 gram-negative and two gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, and aliquots  dispersed for 0-180 s, using an mse sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% n2, 10% h2 and 10% co2. viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. breakage of t. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than gram-negative. a. viscous was more resistant than strep sanguis. gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by f. nucleatum b asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of group iv bacteroides, and b melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' bacteroides and oral campylobacter. t. denticola, selenomonas sputigena and wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
