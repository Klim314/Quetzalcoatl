TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  == this work was to assess the isolation and identification of thai oral bacteria. seventeen viridans group streptococci (vgs) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16s rna gene sequences analysis. the gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (group  i) were identified as streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (group ii) were streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (group iii) were streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (group iv) was streptococcus mutans. seventeen lactic acid bacterial  isolates were gram-positive and catalase negative. they did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. they were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in group a (11 isolates) and group b (2 isolates) which were identified as lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. the tetrad-forming cocci in group c (3 isolates) and group d (1 isolate) were identified as pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, respectively.

TI  == plasmid transfer in pediococcus spp.: intergeneric and intrageneric transfer of pip501.
AB  == transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pip501 from streptococcus faecalis to pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici occurred between cells immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of dnase. expression  of the pip501-linked erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was observed in transconjugants. intrageneric transfer of pip501 from a p. pentosaceus donor to various pediococcal recipients occurred at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. intergeneric transfer of plasmid pip501 from p. pentosaceus to s. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis (challis), and streptococcus lactis was observed. similar mating experiments showed no evidence for the transfer of the broad-host-range r-plasmid pam beta 1  to pediococcus spp. recipients.
