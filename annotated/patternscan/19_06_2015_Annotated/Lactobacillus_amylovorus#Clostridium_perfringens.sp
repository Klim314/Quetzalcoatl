TI  == isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
AB  == quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. the gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. there still  is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. the strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. the results showed that escherichia coli, stretococcus lutetiensis, lactobacillus acidophilus, weissella  confusa, enterococcus gilvus, clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. among them, c. perfringens and b. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of c. perfringens. in conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.

TI  == potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == enzymatic depolymerization of gum tragacanth: bifidogenic potential of low molecular weight oligosaccharides.
AB  == gum tragacanth derived from the plant "goat's horn" (astragalus sp.) has a long history of use as a stabilizing, viscosity-enhancing agent in food emulsions. the gum contains pectinaceous arabinogalactans and fucose-substituted xylogalacturonans. in this work, gum tragacanth from astragalus gossypinus was enzymatically depolymerized using aspergillus niger pectinases (pectinex be color). the enzymatically degraded products were divided into three molecular weight fractions via membrane separation: hag1 < 2 kda; 2 kda < hag2 < 10 kda; hag3 > 10 kda. compositional and linkage analyses showed that these three fractions also varied with respect to composition and structural elements: hag1 and hag2 were enriched in arabinose, galactose, and galacturonic acid, but low in fucose and xylose, whereas hag3 was high in (terminal) xylose, fucose, and 1,4-bonded galacturonic acid, but low in arabinose and galactose content. the growth-stimulating potential of the three enzymatically produced gum tragacanth fractions was evaluated via growth assessment on seven different probiotic strains in single-culture fermentations on bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (two strains), b. longum subsp. infantis (three strains), lactobacillus acidophilus , b. lactis, and on one pathogenic strain of clostridium perfringens  . the fractions hag1 and hag2 consistently promoted higher growth of the probiotic strains than hag3, especially of the three b. longum subsp. infantis strains, and the growth promotion on hag1 and hag2 was better than that on galactan (control). hag3 completely inhibited the growth of the c. perfringens strain. tragacanth gum is thus a potential source of prebiotic carbohydrates that exert no viscosity effects and which may find use as natural functional food ingredients.

TI  == the effect of selected synbiotics on microbial composition and short-chain fatty  acid production in a model system of the human colon.
AB  == background: prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can be used to modulate both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota and thereby potentially affecting host health beneficially. the aim of this study was to investigate the  effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human  fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. methods and findings: carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (ncfm) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04 (bl-04) under laboratory conditions. the most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (scfa).the following combinations were studied: ncfm with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat beta-glucan hydrolysate (obgh) and bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. all carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of ncfm and bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 10(3)-10(4) fold and 10-10(2)  fold, respectively. also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio  of bacteroidetes/firmicutes (calculated using qpcr results for bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium perfringens cluster i, clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectale group and clostridial cluster xiv) as well as significantly increasing scfa levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. the decreases in the modified ratio of bacteroidetes/firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). conclusions: the results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of scfa of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health.

TI  == expression and characterization of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from emericella nidulans in pichia pastoris for enzymatic design of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides from potato galactans.
AB  == potato pulp is a high-volume side-stream from industrial potato starch manufacturing. enzymatically solubilized beta-1,4-galactan-rich potato pulp polysaccharides of molecular weights >100 kda (sppp) are highly bifidogenic in human fecal sample fermentations in vitro. the objective of the present study was to use potato beta-1,4-galactan and the sppp as substrates for enzymatic production of potentially prebiotic compounds of lower and narrower molecular weight. a novel endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from emericella nidulans (anamorph aspergillus nidulans), gh family 53, was produced in a recombinant pichia pastoris strain. the enzyme was purified by cu(2+) affinity chromatography and its optimal reaction conditions were determined to ph 5 and 49 degrees c via a statistical experimental design. the specific activity of the e. nidulans enzyme  expressed in p. pastoris was similar to that of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from aspergillus niger used as benchmark. the e. nidulans enzyme expressed in p. pastoris generated a spectrum poly- and oligo-saccharides which were fractionated by membrane filtration. the potential growth promoting properties of each fraction were evaluated by growth of beneficial gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria. all the galactan- and sppp-derived products promoted the growth of probiotic strains of bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus and generally did not support the propagation of clostridium perfringens in single culture fermentations. notably the growth of b. longum was significantly higher (p<0.05) or at least as good on galactan- and sppp-derived products as fructooligosaccharides (fos). except in one case these products did not support the growth of the pathogen cl. perfringens to any significant extent.

TI  == the effect of probiotics on faecal microbiota and genotoxic activity of faecal water in patients with atopic dermatitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: colonic microbiota is involved in the etiology of colon cancer according to several reports. studies also indicate that the microbiota differs between atopic patients and healthy subjects. objective: to evaluate whether a probiotic mix containing lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dgcc 420 can affect  the microbiota and its genotoxic activity in healthy subjects and patients with atopic dermatitis (ad). methods: a placebo-controlled cross-over study was conducted. fifteen healthy adults and 15 adult ad patients consumed 2x100 ml/d of either a probiotic or a placebo drink for 8 weeks followed by a wash out period of 2 weeks before crossing the intervention. faecal water was isolated from stool samples collected at the end of each period. ht29c19a cells incubated with faecal water were measured for dna damage using single-cell gel electrophoresis ("comet  assay"). bacterial species were determined by qpcr and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by means of gas chromatography. results: probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilli, whereas numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroidetes remained unchanged. clostridium perfringens cluster i-ii was significantly reduced in healthy subjects. genotoxic potential (expressed as tail intensity) of faecal water, was  not affected. however, tail intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic period compared to placebo (23.5 vs. 16.7%) in ad patients. although faecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were not affected, faecal ph was significantly reduced (7.0 vs. 6.6) in ad patients after probiotics. conclusion:  the results indicate that probiotics lower the genotoxic potential of faecal water in ad patients. the faecal c. perfringens cluster i-ii levels remained unaffected suggesting either a change in their activity, or the fact that other bacterial species are responsible for the reduced genotoxic activity of faecal water.

TI  == microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  == it is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. pyrosequencing targeting the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. the bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. clustering and venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. traditional fecal indicators, i.e., escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. besides the bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., parasutterella excrementihominis, veillonella sp., dialister invisus, megamonas funiformis, and ruminococcus lactaris for the human and lactobacillus amylovorus and atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. these microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent  on the absence or presence of a single indicator. monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

TI  == effects of a probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus strain on feed tolerance in dogs with non-specific dietary sensitivity.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus strain dsm 13241 in dogs with non-specific dietary sensitivity (nss). six adult german shorthair pointers with nss consecutively received a control dry diet and  the same diet supplemented with the probiotic (6 x 10(6) cfu/g) for 12 weeks each, followed by another control period of four weeks. frequency of defecations, faecal quality and nutrient digestibility were determined. faeces were cultured for clostridium perfringens, escherichia spp., lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) was performed. feeding the probiotic improved faecal consistency, faecal dry matter and defecation frequency (p < 0.05). faecal concentrations of culturable lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased numerically, but not significantly, also the decrease of the numbers of c. perfringens and escherichia spp. did not reach the level of significance. results from fish showed more constant bacterial populations. it can be concluded that l. acidophilus dsm 13241 can stabilise the digestive processes in dogs with nss.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

TI  == the effect of probiotic fermented milk and inulin on the functions and microecology of the intestine.
AB  == we investigated the effects of a probiotic fermented milk and inulin on gastrointestinal function and microecology. the study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). after a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3x200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (bifidobacterium longum bb536, bifidobacterium spp. 420 and lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin,  or (3) a control fermented milk. during the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of ph and microbes,  including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, bacteroides  and clostridium perfringens. consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (p=0.009,  p=0.003) and bifidobacteria (p=0.046, p=0.038) compared with the baseline. compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (p=0.005, ancova). subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (p<0.001). in conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal  symptoms.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == selection of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == lactobacilli were isolated from chicken gastrointestinal tract and examined for their potentially probiotic properties towards their inhibitory activity against  poultry enteropathogenic bacteria. biochemical tests, its-pcr and cell wall protein analysis were used to characterize the lactobacillus isolates. the identification of isolated lactobacillus strains based on phenotypic properties was not always satisfactory. its-pcr together with protein profile were found to  be helpful in strain identification. lactobacilli were tested for the inhibitory  activity against selected strains of poultry enteropathogenic bacteria (salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens). examined  supernatants from lactobacillus broth cultures demonstrated major antimicrobial activity against c. perfringens. lower antimicrobial activity were observed against e. coli and salmonella enteritidis. the strongest inhibition effect were  obtained using supernatant of lactobacillus acidophilus strain 3d. results received from this study confirmed that identification of lactobacillus spp. is often tedious. some isolates, which are in vitro antagonistic against enteropathogenic bacteria may be considered as potential candidates for poultry probiotics, especially in controlling necrotic enteritis caused by c. perfringens.

TI  == enumeration of specific bacterial populations in complex intestinal communities using quantitative pcr based on the chaperonin-60 target.
AB  == we used qpcr and the target gene chaperonin-60 (cpn60) to enumerate clostridium perfringens genomes in dna extracts from contents of the chicken gastrointestinal tract with the aim of optimizing this methodology to enumerate any bacterium of interest. to determine the most accurate protocols for determining target species abundance, we compared various dna extraction methods in combination with four methods for producing standard curves. factors affecting accuracy included the co-purification of pcr inhibitors and/or fluorescence quenchers and the yield of  target dna in the extract. anion exchange chromatography of the spiked test samples enabled accurate enumeration of c. perfringens using a standard curve comprised of a plasmid containing a fragment of c. perfringens cpn60. we used qpcr to enumerate c. perfringens and other intestinal bacteria in ileum and cecum samples from chickens that had been challenged with c. perfringens and compared the results with viable counts on corresponding selective agars. we conclude that qpcr-based molecular enumeration of target species in the gastrointestinal tract  is feasible, but care must be taken in order to mitigate the effects of confounding factors that can affect the apparent cell count.

TI  == selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin,  menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100  microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.

AB  == for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a  complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  == 2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum  atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced  rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz  was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and  bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of  intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.

TI  == fructooligosaccharides and lactobacillus acidophilus modify gut microbial populations, total tract nutrient digestibilities and fecal protein catabolite concentrations in healthy adult dogs.
AB  == the objective of this research was to determine whether fructooligosaccharides (fos) and (or) lactobacillus acidophilus (lac) affected concentrations of gut microbial populations, fermentative end products and nutrient digestibilities in  healthy adult dogs. two experiments were performed using 40 adult dogs (20 dogs/experiment). dogs in each experiment were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatments. twice daily, treatments were given orally via gelatin capsules: 1) 2  g sucrose + 80 mg cellulose; 2) 2 g fos + 80 mg cellulose; 3) 2 g sucrose + 1 x 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) lac; or 4) 2 g fos + 1 x 10(9) cfu lac. data were analyzed by the general linear models procedure of sas. in experiment 1, fos resulted in lower (p = 0.08) clostridium perfringens and greater fecal butyrate (p = 0.06) and lactate (p < 0.05) concentrations. in experiment 2, fos supplementation increased (p < 0.05) bifidobacteria, increased lactobacilli (p =  0.08), increased fecal lactate (p = 0.06) and butyrate (p < 0.05), and decreased  (p < 0.05) fecal ammonia, isobutyrate, isovalerate and total branched-chain fatty acid concentrations. dogs fed lac had the highest fecal concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol in experiment 1 and dimethyl sulfide in experiment 2, whereas dogs fed fos had the lowest concentrations of these compounds. overall, fos appeared to enhance indices of gut health by positively altering gut microbial ecology and fecal protein catabolites, whereas lac was more effective when fed in combination with fos rather than fed alone.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

(lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

AB  == conventional cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) using 16s  rrna-based probes were compared for the enumeration of human colonic bacteria. groups of common intestinal anaerobic bacteria were enumerated in slurries prepared from fecal samples of three healthy volunteers. to introduce variation between the samples, they were incubated for 48 h in batch culture (anaerobic) fermenters at 37 degrees c, and pure cultures of bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium perfringens, or lactobacillus acidophilus were added. samples were taken from the fermenters at different times. total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, and lactobacilli were enumerated by both plating and fish. the results showed that plate counts of total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and bacteroides were approximately ten-fold lower than the corresponding fish counts. numbers of clostridia were higher using the plating method, probably because the clostridia probe used in fish analyses was designed  to only detect part of the genus clostridium. the introduced variation in the methods could be detected by both methods and was comparable.

TI  == ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  == several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, gn; beta-glucosidase, gs; arylsulphatase, as; azoreductase, ar; nitroreductase, nr) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. cell-associated as and extracellular gs were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while ar changed little throughout the gut. measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. nr decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular gn  was reduced by 50%. most probable number (mpn) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing gs and ar  were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. numbers of gn-  and as-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising nr were highly variable. screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging  to six different genera, showed that bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of gs, whereas b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of gn. in  general, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of ar. all five clostridia studied (clostridium bifermentans, c. septicum, c. perfringens, c. sporogenes and c. butyricum) produced nr and ar, as  did the bacteroides (b. fragilis, b. ovatus and b. vulgatus). escherichia coli and c. perfringens formed large amounts of nr. levels of as production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. in-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (v1-v3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (r) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of gs were up to four-fold higher (v3) at r = 31.1 h. bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic  micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in gs activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl  gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for  growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.

AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == probiotics, cecal microflora, and aberrant crypts in the rat colon.
AB  == our hypothesis was that administration of bifidobacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus or both to rats will minimize the numbers of aberrant crypts in the distal colon that develop in response to the carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh). a series of experiments was designed to test this hypothesis where the treatments used were as follows: skim milk controls (skim-basal), skim milk + bifidobacteria (bifido-basal), skim milk + fructooligosaccharide (skim-fos), and  skim milk + bifidobacteria + fructooligosaccharide (bifido-fos). in two experiments, bifido-bacteria + fos administration significantly decreased the number of aberrant crypts that developed, but there was no clear relationship of  aberrant crypts to numbers of bifidobacteria or clostridium perfringens. in the third experiment, the bifido-fos treatment led to significantly fewer aberrant crypts and aberrant crypt foci than the bifido-basal treatment. the skim-fos group had significantly more cecal bifidobacteria than the skim-basal group and significantly fewer c. perfringens than the skim-basal and bifido-basal. in a fourth experiment, l. acidophilus was added as an additional treatment. the number of aberrant crypts was not significantly different among the groups. however, the number of c. perfringens was significantly decreased by the addition of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus or the combination of the two, whereas the numbers of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus were not affected by treatment. a significant correlation (r2 = 0.84, p < 0.01) was noted between the body weight of rats at dmh administration and the magnitude of the difference in aberrant crypts between the skim-basal rats and the bifido-fos rats. the results suggest that there is variability in the effects of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus administration on both aberrant crypt formation and c. perfringens.

AB  == to test the interaction between various species of bacteria and salmonella serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), the population of s. typhimurium was measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens in the presence of escherichia coli (e. coli) and one of the four intestinal bacteria; lactobacillus acidophilus. clostridium perfringens, bifidobacterium thermophilum and bacteroides vulgatus. competitive exclusion of s. typhimurium by di-flora chicken was not demonstrated. but the population of s. typhimurium was temporarily suppressed in di-flora chickens with e. coli and l. acidophilus. in penta-flora chickens with e. coli and these four intestinal bacteria, the population of s. typhimurium was suppressed for only 2 days. in normalized chickens, the population of s. typhimurium was markedly suppressed.

TI  == influence of bacteria on clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
AB  == when monoflora chickens with lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of  c. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. c. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/g after inoculation 10(8) cfu broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. when c. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, c. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. these findings indicate that the pathogenicity of c. perfringens was suppressed by l. acidophilus or s. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.

TI  == detection of lactobacilli and their interaction with clostridia in human gastrointestinal tracts and in vitro.
AB  == culture counts of aerobic lactobacilli in the feces of vegetarians ([8.1 +/- 0.7] of log10 bacteria per gram dry weight) were higher than those of meat consumers ([5.2 +/- 0.1] of log10 bacteria per gram dry weight). co-culture of lactobacillus acidophilus and clostridium perfringens in various media revealed that an interaction between these two species. the ph was the most important factor controlling their relative growth, which might explain the relative abundance of lactobacilli in feces of men and animals on vegetarian diets. lactobacilli but not clostridia were detected in feces of newborn infants. these  findings are discussed in relation to health.

TI  == [lactitol and neomycin: monotherapy or combined therapy in the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy?].
AB  == the beneficial effect of disaccharides, lactulose and lactitol, in prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is well established but their use in combination with neomycin is still controversial. we studied in vitro the fecal bacterial growth, acid and gas formation in presence of lactitol (beta-galactoside-sorbitol) and neomycin alone or in combination. the results indicate that neomycin only inhibits the growth of susceptible bacteria (e. coli, staph. aureus) which, conversely, are poor lactitol fermenters. the resistant organisms (lactobacillus acidophilus, clostridium perfringens) that are efficient disaccharide fermenters continue to metabolize lactitol still when antibiotic is  added. addition of lactitol 10% increased the inhibitory effect of neomycin on bacterial growth by 25-50% within 60-70 min. these preliminary data suggest that  lactitol and neomycin may have additional or synergistic effects in vivo when used together in presence of favourable intestinal microbial environment.

TI  == population of salmonella typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  == to test the interaction of various species of bacteria with salmonella typhimurium, levels of s. typhimurium were measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens inoculated with various test bacteria and subsequently with s. typhimurium. the population of s. typhimurium was suppressed in the cecum of chickens previously inoculated with escherichia coli. populations of bacteroides  vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, bifidobacterium thermophilum, or lactobacillus acidophilus were transiently, though not significantly, suppressed by s. typhimurium. inoculation of chickens with c. perfringens caused a terminal increase in the population of s. typhimurium. thus the effect of cecal contents on reducing the levels of s. typhimurium in the cecum may be due to the presence  of e. coli in the cecal contents.

TI  == the influence of various bacteria on the cecal mucosa of monoflora chickens infected with eimeria tenella. a scanning electron microscopic study.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at the age of 2 days by an oral inoculation of one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis). two days later the chickens were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocytes per bird). there were four groups: uninfected birds as controls, the birds infected with either bacteria or e. tenella alone, and the birds infected with bacteria and e. tenella. as observed under the scanning electron microscope (sem) seven days after e. tenella infection, damage of the cecal mucosa in all groups infected with bacteria + e. tenella was more severe than in that infected with e. tenella alone. most severe damage to the cecal mucosa was found in the birds infected with either c. perfringens or b. thermophilum combined with e. tenella.

TI  == effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas  10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == introduction and reisolation of selected gram-positive bacteria from fermented edible wastes.
AB  == a fermentation process using lactobacillus acidophilus added to edible food wastes was evaluated for its bactericidal action on selected gram-positive organisms. the lactobacillus fermentation converts food wastes into an animal feed ingredient. in this study, 5 gram-positive bacteria of zoonotic importance were individually tested. these organisms were: group e streptococcus, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, and listeria monocytogenes. for each experiment, lactobacillus was first mixed into ground waste; one of the test organisms was then inoculated and mixed. this mixture was divided among eight 5.5-l containers  and incubated (duplicates) at 5 c, 10 c, 20 c, and 30 c for 96 hours. internal waste temperature, reduction-oxidation, and ph were monitored. waste samples were taken initially and at subsequent 24-hour periods. qualitative and quantitative recoveries of the test bacteria were attempted for each sample. group e streptococcus was reisolated in increasing numbers at all temperatures throughout the fermentation period. erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was recovered throughout the 96-hour period at 5 c; at 10 c it was recovered at 24 hours but not at 48 hours. erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was killed by 24 hours at 20 c and 30 c fermentation temperatures. clostridium perfringens survived the entire test period at 5 c, 10 c, and 20 c; it was killed by 72 hours at 30 c. neither corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis nor listeria monocytogenes was reisolated at any temperature at any time.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.

TI  == [studies on the composition of the fecal flora of healthy dogs with the special references of lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora (author's transl)].
AB  == with the new method the fecal flora of 13 clinically healthy dogs aged 3 to 42 months was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. it was characterized by that bacteroidaceae constituted the most prodominant flora, catenabacteria, streptococci, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were the next most numerous, enterobacteria consisted the accompanying flora. the numbers of clostridium perfringens were remarkably fluctuated and seem to be influenced by the composition of the food ingested by the host. the total cultivable counts averaged log 10.8 +/- 0.2/g. the composition of the lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora in the feces of 34 dogs from 3 different age groups was analysed. in the feces of all age groups l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. fermenti with 9 different types were found. within the lactobacilli l. acidophilus type vi c, l. salivarius type vi a and l. fermenti type iv b were most frequently found. l. acidophilus types vi c and xi, l. salivarius types vi a and vi b could not be placed in any established types of each species, and were described as new types. bifidobacteria were regularly found in large numbers in the feces of dogs aged 2 to 24 months. b. adolescentis and b. pseudolongum consisted the main bifidobacterium flora.

AB  == smith, rodney f. (university of maryland, baltimore), donald e. shay, and norman  j. doorenbos. antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids. j. bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-a new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. the gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were  used in the studies. the organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and  molds. the gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. all 16 steroids interfered  to some extent with pigmentation in serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in pseudomonas aeruginosa. in a few instances, some of the molds were  stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.
