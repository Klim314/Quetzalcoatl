selection of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria.
lactobacilli were isolated from chicken gastrointestinal tract and examined for their potentially probiotic properties towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria.
biochemical tests, its-pcr and cell wall protein analysis were used to characterize the lactobacillus isolates.
the identification of isolated lactobacillus strains based on phenotypic properties was not always satisfactory.
its-pcr together with protein profile were found to be helpful in strain identification.
lactobacilli were tested for the inhibitory activity against selected strains of poultry enteropathogenic bacteria (salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens).
examined supernatants from lactobacillus broth cultures demonstrated major antimicrobial activity against c. perfringens.
lower antimicrobial activity were observed against e. coli and salmonella enteritidis.
the strongest inhibition effect were obtained using supernatant of lactobacillus acidophilus strain 3d.
results received from this study confirmed that identification of lactobacillus spp. is often tedious.
some isolates, which are in vitro antagonistic against enteropathogenic bacteria may be considered as potential candidates for poultry probiotics, especially in controlling necrotic enteritis caused by c. perfringens.
