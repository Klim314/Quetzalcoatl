TI  - Transfer of Bacteroides splanchnicus to Odoribacter gen. nov. as Odoribacter splanchnicus comb. nov., and description of Odoribacter denticanis sp. nov., isolated from the crevicular spaces of canine periodontitis patients.
AB  - Numerous novel anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the crevicular spaces of dogs with periodontitis. The phenotypic characteristics of these bacterial isolates indicated that they were similar to members of the genus Porphyromonas. However, comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates indicated that they were related to members of the Bacteroides splanchnicus subgroup. A representative of the novel isolates, strain B106(T), induced alveolar bone loss in a mouse model of experimental periodontal disease. Based on biochemical, morphological, molecular phylogenetic, and pathogenic evidence, it is proposed that the taxonomic subgroup containing these novel isolates and B. splanchnicus should be classified in a new genus, Odoribacter gen. nov., within the family 'Porphyromonadaceae'. In addition, it is proposed that B. splanchnicus should be reclassified as Odoribacter splanchnicus comb. nov., and that the newly identified isolates should be classified as representing Odoribacter denticanis sp. nov., the type strain of which is B106(T) (=ATCC PTA-3625(T)=CNCM I-3225(T)).
