TI  == cloning and characterization of the proximal promoter region of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) interleukin-6 gene.
AB  == interleukin-6 (il6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with important immunoregulatory functions. its expression is inducible in immune cells and tissues of several fish species. we also found that il6 mrna abundance was significantly increased in spleen, liver, and gill of rainbow trout after experimental infection with aeromonas salmonicida. genomic dna sequences of il6 orthologs from three salmonid species revealed a conserved exon/intron structure and a high overall nucleotide  identity of >88%. to uncover key mechanisms regulating il6 expression in salmonid fish, we amplified a fragment of the proximal il6 promoter from rainbow trout and identified in-silico conserved binding sites for nf-kappab and cebp. the activity of this il6 promoter fragment was analyzed in the established human embryonic kidney line hek-293. luciferase- and gfp-based reporter systems revealed that the proximal il6 promoter is activated by escherichia coli. essentially, both reporter systems proved that nf-kappab p50, but not nf-kappab p65 or cebp, activates the il6 promoter fragment. truncation of this fragment caused a significant decrease in il6 promoter activation. this characterization of the proximal promoter of the il6-encoding gene provides basic knowledge about the il6 gene expression in rainbow trout.

TI  == influence of external bacterial structures on the efficiency of photodynamic inactivation by a cationic porphyrin.
AB  == the main targets of photodynamic inactivation (pdi) are the external bacterial structures, cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. in this work it was evaluated how the external bacterial structures influence the pdi efficiency. to reach this objective 8 bacteria with distinct external structures were selected; 4 gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, with typical gram-negative external structures; aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas hydrophila both with an s-layer and  rhodopirellula sp., with a peptidoglycan-less proteinaceous cell wall and with cytoplasm compartmentalization) and 4 gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, with typical gram-positive external structures; truepera radiovictrix, deinococcus geothermalis and deinococcus radiodurans, all with thick cell walls that give them gram-positive stains, but including a second complex multi-layered membrane and structurally analogous to that of gram-negative bacteria). the studies were performed in the presence of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetraiodide (tetra-py(+)-me) at 5.0 mum with white light (40 w m(-2)). the susceptibility of  each bacteria to pdi by tetra-py(+)-me was dependent on bacteria external structures. although all gram-positive bacteria were inactivated to the detection limit (reduction of approximately 8 log) after 60-180 min of irradiation, the inactivation followed distinct patterns. among the gram-negative bacteria, e. coli was the only species to be inactivated to the detection limit ( approximately 8 log after 180 min). the efficiency of inactivation of the two species of aeromonas was similar (reduction of approximately 5-6 log after 270 min). rhodopirellula was less susceptible (reduction of approximately 4 log after 270 min). as previously observed, the gram-positive bacteria are more easily inactivated than gram-negative strains, and this is even true for t. radiovictrix, d. geothermalis and d. radiodurans, which have a complex multi-layered cell wall. the results support the theory that the outer cell structures are major bacterial targets for pdi. moreover, the chemical composition of the external structures has a stronger effect on pdi efficiency than complexity and the number of layers of the external coating, and lipids seem to be an important target of pdi.

TI  == identification and modeling of a novel chloramphenicol resistance protein detected by functional metagenomics in a wetland of lerma, mexico.
AB  == the exploration of novel antibiotic resistance determinants in a particular environment may be limited because of the presence of uncultured microorganisms.  in this work, a culture-independent approach based on functional metagenomics was applied to search for chloramphenicol resistance genes in agro-industrial wastewater in lerma de villada, mexico. to this end, a metagenomic library was generated in escherichia coli dh10b containing dna isolated from environmental samples of the residual arsenic-enriched (10 mg/ml) effluent. one resistant clone was detected in this library and further analyzed. an open reading frame similar  to a multidrug resistance protein from aeromonas salmonicida and responsible for  chloramphenicol resistance was identified, sequenced, and found to encode a member of the major facilitator superfamily (mfs). our results also showed that the expression of this gene restored streptomycin sensitivity in e. coli dh10b cells. to gain further insight into the phenotype of this mfs family member, we developed a model of the membrane protein multiporter that, in addition, may serve as a template for developing new antibiotics.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of elevated ph on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  == ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. there is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. the present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased ph (ph 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (aeromonas spp., yersinia ruckeri, edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus sp., bacillus sp.)  and indicators listed in international maritime organization d2 standards; namely, vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. volumes of 5 n naoh were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired ph adjustments. viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/ml for bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/ml for e. faecalis. the effective endpoints of ph and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at ph 12.0 or lower. the lowest parameters examined, 4 h at ph 10.0, were bactericidal to v. cholera, e. ictaluri, three of four isolates of e. coli, and (three of four) aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. bactericidal effect was attained at ph 10.0 within 12 h for the other a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for  p. fluorescens, and the remaining e. coli.

TI  == quality control ranges for testing broth microdilution susceptibility of flavobacterium columnare and f. psychrophilum to nine antimicrobials.
AB  == a multi-laboratory broth microdilution method trial was performed to standardize  the specialized test conditions required for the fish pathogens flavobacterium columnare and f. psychrophilum. nine laboratories tested the quality control (qc) strains escherichia coli atcc 25922 and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida  atcc 33658 against 10 antimicrobials (ampicillin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, flumequine, gentamicin, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine, oxolinic acid,  oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in diluted (4 g l-1) cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth incubated at 28 and 18 degrees c for 44-48 and 92-96 h, respectively. qc ranges were set for 9 of the 10 antimicrobials. most of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) distributions (16 of 18, 9 drugs at both temperatures) for a. salmonicida atcc 33658 were centered on a single median mic +/- 1 two-fold drug dilution resulting in a qc range that spanned 3 dilutions. more of the e. coli atcc 25922 mic distributions (7 of 16) were centered between 2 mic dilutions requiring a qc range that spanned 4 dilutions. a qc range could not be determined for e. coli atcc 25922 against 2 antimicrobials at the low temperature. these data and their associated qc ranges  have been approved by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), and will be included in the next edition of the clsi m49-a guideline. this method represents the first standardized reference method for testing fish pathogenic flavobacterium spp.

TI  == analysis of a ferric uptake regulator (fur) knockout mutant in aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis; a serious infectious disease in aquaculture raised salmonids. iron  acquisition has been shown to be critical for the survival of pathogenic bacteria during the course of infection. previous work has demonstrated that a. salmonicida expresses iron-repressible iromp proteins, suggesting the presence of iron acquisition systems that are under the control of a ferric uptake regulator  (fur). in this study, the a. salmonicida fur has been sequenced and a fur deletion strain generated. the a. salmonicida fur gene has an open reading frame  of 428 bp, coding for a protein of 143 amino acids, and with high homology to previously described fur proteins. the fur protein product had a 94% sequence identity and 96% sequence similarity to the aeromonas hydrophila fur protein product. transcription of the a. salmonicida fur gene was not regulated by the iron status of the bacterium and is not autoregulated, as in escherichia coli. proteomic analysis of the a. salmonicida fur mutant, fails to repress iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in the presence of iron. the a. salmonicida fur::ko mutant shows significantly reduced pathogenicity compared to  the wild-type parental strain. in addition, the a. salmonicida fur mutant provides an important tool for further investigation of the iron acquisition mechanisms utilized by a. salmonicida.

TI  == ligand and pathogen specificity of the atlantic salmon serum c-type lectin.
AB  == background: an atlantic salmon (salmo salar) c-type lectin (ssl) binds to mannose and related sugars as well as to the surface of aeromonas salmonicida. to characterize this lectin as a pathogen recognition receptor in salmon, aspects of its interaction with molecules and with intact pathogens were investigated. methods: ssl was isolated using whole-yeast-affinity and mannan-affinity chromatography. the binding of ssl to the two major surface molecules of a. salmonicida, lipopolysaccharide (lps) and a-layer protein was investigated by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. microbial binding specificity of ssl was examined by whole cell binding assays using a range of species. carbohydrate ligand specificity of ssl was examined using glycan array analysis and frontal affinity chromatography. results: ssl showed binding to bacteria and yeast including, pseudomonas fluorescens, a. salmonicida, a. hydrophila, pichia pastoris, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, but there was no detectable binding to yersinia ruckeri. in antimicrobial assays, ssl showed no activity against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, s. cerevisiae, or a. salmonicida, but it was found to agglutinate e. coli. the major surface molecule  of a. salmonicida recognized by ssl was shown to be lps and not the a-layer protein. lps binding was mannose-inhibitable. glycans containing n-acetylglucosamine were shown to be predominant ligands. conclusion: ssl has a distinct ligand preference while allowing recognition of a wide variety of related carbohydrate structures. general significance: ssl is likely to function  as a wide-spectrum pattern recognition protein.

TI  == toxoid construction of asap1, a lethal toxic aspzincin metalloendopeptidase of aeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes, and studies of its activity and processing.
AB  == asap1 is a toxic aspzincin metalloendopeptidase secreted by the fish pathogen aeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes. the protease is highly immunogenic and antibodies against asap1 evoke a passive protection against infection with a. salmonicida subsp. achromogenes. the protease is expressed as 37 kda pre-pro-protein and processed to an active enzyme of 19kda in a. salmonicida subsp. achromogenes. recombinant expression of asap1(rec) in e. coli results in a protease of 22 kda that is not secreted. asap1(rec) induces comparable pathological changes in atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.) to native asap1(wt). the aim of the study was to construct asap1 toxoids by exchanging catalytically important amino acids in the active site region of the protease. four different asap1 mutants (asap1(e294a), asap1(e294q), asap1(y309a), and asap1(y309f)) were successfully constructed by one step site directed mutagenesis, expressed in e. coli bl21 c43 as pre-pro-proteins and purified by his-tag affinity chromatography and gel filtration. three of the resulting mutants (asap1(e294a), asap1(e294q), and asap1(y309a)) were not caseinolytic active and are detected as unprocessed pre-pro-proteins of 37 kda. caseinolytic active asap1(rec) and a mutant with reduced activity, asap1(y309f), were processed to a size of 22 kda. furthermore,  asap1(rec) is able to process the inactive mutants to the mature size of 22 kda,  allowing the conclusion that asap1 is autocatalytically processed. all four mutants asap1(e294a), asap1(e294q), asap1(y309a) and asap1(y309f) are non-toxic in fish but induce a specific anti-asap1 antibody response in arctic charr (salvelinus alpinus l.) and are therefore true toxoids and possible vaccine additives.

TI  == broad diversity of conjugative plasmids in integron-carrying bacteria from wastewater environments.
AB  == in this study we assessed the occurrence, diversity and conjugative potential of  plasmids in integron-carrying aeromonas and enterobacteriaceae from wastewaters.  sixty-six strains were included as donors in mating assays using rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida recipient strains. the diversity of plasmids from donors and transconjugants (resistant to tetracycline or streptomycin) was evaluated by restriction analysis and replicon  typing targeting 19 incompatibility groups. restriction patterns revealed a diverse plasmid pool present in these strains. plasmids were assigned to frepb (aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli, enterobacter sp.), fic (a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp.), fia (shigella sp.), i1 (a. veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli), hi1 (e. coli) and u (aeromonas media) replicons. nevertheless, 50% of the plasmids could not be assigned to any replicon type. among integron-positive transconjugants, frepb, i1 and hi1 replicons were detected. results showed that wastewaters enclose a rich plasmid pool associated  with integron-carrying bacteria, capable of conjugating to different bacterial hosts. moreover, replicons detected in this study in aeromonas strains expand our current knowledge of plasmid diversity in this genus.

TI  == occurrence, abundance and elimination of class 1 integrons in one municipal sewage treatment plant.
AB  == integrons are elements that encode a site-specific recombination system that recognizes and captures mobile gene cassettes and are closely related to multiple resistances of environmental microorganisms. this study was undertaken to determine the efficiency of an activated sludge process to remove integrons. the  prevalence and characteristics of class 1 integrons were investigated for bacterial species isolated from the activated sludge of nanjing jiangxinzhou sewage treatment plant (stp, china). a total of 189 bacterial strains were isolated from influent water, activated sludge and effluent water, and pcr-rflp (polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism) of 16s rrna gene showed that the isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, aeromonas veronii,  klebsiella spp., aeromonas salmonicida and aeromonas media. pcrs showed that 57 isolates contained class 1 integronase gene inti1. the integron detection frequency in the isolated strains was 20.4% for influent, 30.9% for activated sludge and 38.9% for effluent. quantitative real-time pcr assay showed that the abundance of integrons in effluent was higher than that in influent. this study indicates that class 1 integrons are wide-spread in stps which might be involved  in multiple resistances in the activated sludge characterized by high biomass and biodiversity.

TI  == involvement of the gspab complex in assembly of the type ii secretion system secretin of aeromonas and vibrio species.
AB  == the type ii secretion system (t2ss) functions as a transport mechanism to translocate proteins from the periplasm to the extracellular environment. the exea homologue in aeromonas hydrophila, gspa(ah), is an atpase that interacts with peptidoglycan and forms an inner membrane complex with the exeb homologue (gspb(ah)). the complex may be required to generate space in the peptidoglycan mesh that is necessary for the transport and assembly of the megadalton-sized exed homologue (gspd(ah)) secretin multimer in the outer membrane. in this study, the requirement for gspab in the assembly of the t2ss secretin in aeromonas and vibrio species was investigated. we have demonstrated a requirement for gspab in  t2ss assembly in aeromonas salmonicida, similar to that previously observed in a. hydrophila. in the vibrionaceae species vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, and vibrio parahaemolyticus, gspa mutations significantly decreased assembly of the secretin multimer but had minimal effects on the secretion of t2ss substrates. the lack of effect on secretion of the mutant of gspa of v. cholerae (gspa(vc)) was explained by the finding that native secretin expression greatly exceeds the  level needed for efficient secretion in v. cholerae. in cross-complementation experiments, secretin assembly and secretion in an a. hydrophila gspa mutant were partially restored by the expression of gspab from v. cholerae in trans, further  suggesting that gspab(vc) performs the same role in vibrio species as gspab(ah) does in the aeromonads. these results indicate that the gspab complex is functional in the assembly of the secretin in vibrio species but that a redundancy of gspab function may exist in this genus.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae associated with eggs of podocnemis expansa and podocnemis unifilis (testudines:chelonia) in nonpolluted sites of national park of araguaia  plains, brazil.
AB  == fertile eggs of podocnemis expansa and podocnemis unifilis were investigated for  the presence of enterobacteria, as these two endangered species have the potential for conservation measures that include egg transfer. knowledge of normal microflora associated with turtles and turtle eggs would help effectively  manage the transfer of these eggs among institutions. thirty eggs of each species were collected, aseptically transferred, cracked inside plastic bags containing tetrathionate broth, and spread on selective media plates. ten samples of sand and water were also examined for the presence of fecal coliforms using colilert quanti-tray kits. enterobacteriaceae were identified using an api 20e biochemical test kit. a majority of the bacteria isolated were potential pathogens. all egg samples were positive for enterobacteriaceae, among which 15 eggs of p. expansa were positive for shigella flexneri. other isolates included chromobacterium violaceum, escherichia coli, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. eggs of p. unifilis were most frequently positive for shigella flexneri and c. violaceum, and less frequently positive for a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and salmonella choleraesuis subsp. arizonae. the source of the bacteria in these eggs is unknown, but the nesting beaches were considered a source as water samples had low total coliform counts and e. coli was isolated from only one sand sample. this study demonstrated that enterobacteriaceae are part of the indigenous microflora of chelonians.

TI  == ovarian hydrobursitis in female camels (camelus dromedaries): biochemical, bacterial and protozoal evaluation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate female camels affected with ovarian hydrobursitis (n = 31) for hematological and biochemical findings and for bacterial and protozoal infections. blood samples were obtained and surgical ablation of the affected bursa was performed. bursal fluid, follicular fluid, and serum were subjected to hormonal and biochemical analyses. bursal fluids were cultured and colonies were identified using biomerieux vitek two compact system.  passive haemagglutination test was used for detection of trypanosoma evansi. indirect elisa technique was carried out for detection of anti-hydatid cysts anti-bodies. neutrophilia was found in the affected animals (p = 0.01) with tendencies for monocytosis (p = 0.06) and eosinophelia (p = 0.05). bursal fluid had a tendency for high estradiol-17beta concentration compared to blood serum (p = 0.07). progesterone and cholesterol concentrations were similar in bursal fluid, follicular fluid and serum. total protein, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations were greater (p < 0.05) in the bursal fluid than in serum. oligella urethralis, alloiococcus otitis, granulicatella adicens, escherichia coli, sphingobacterium thalpophilum, streptococcus sanguinis, aeromonas salmonicida, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus hominis, and rhizobium radiobacter were isolated from 46.7% of bursal fluids. t.  evansi was positive in 9.7% of cases. none were positive for hydatid cyst. accordingly, we suggest that the ovarian hydrobursitis syndrome is initially an inflammatory process and the accumulated bursal fluid is partially originated from follicular fluid.

TI  == defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

TI  == aeromonas salmonicida type i pilus system contributes to host colonization but not invasion.
AB  == the host-adherence strategies employed by aeromonas salmonicida subsp, salmonicida, the etiological agent of an infectious bacteremia of salmonids, are  poorly understood. in addition to the outer protein coat or s-layer, a. salmonicida has both type i and type iv pili loci. the a. salmonicida type i or fim pilus is encoded by an operon with genes for a chaperone, an usher, and 3 pilus subunits and is predicted to be similar to the pap fimbriae of uropathogenic escherichia coli, which are considered significant virulence factors. a fim-deficient strain of a. salmonicida strain a449, delta fim, was created by deleting this operon. virulence of delta fim was unchanged in direct live challenges of atlantic salmon salmo salar l., a natural host for a. salmonicida. a measure of clinically inapparent (covert) infections suggested fim was required to establish or maintain a covert infection. this was confirmed by an ex vivo adherence and invasion assay using freshly excised salmon gastrointestinal (gi) tract, which showed that, compared to the parental strain,  the ability of the isogenic delta fim mutant strain to adhere to the salmon gi tract was reduced but, once adhered, its ability to invade was unchanged. thus the fim pilus functions as an adhesin in a. salmonicida and the presence of a functional fim improved the efficiency of a. salmonicida infection of atlantic salmon.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of tru-1, the endogenous class c beta-lactamase from aeromonas enteropelogenes.
AB  == aeromonas enteropelogenes (formerly a. tructi) was described to be an ampicillin-susceptible and cephalothin-resistant aeromonas species, which suggests the production of a cephalosporinase. strain atcc 49803 was susceptible  to amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem but resistant to cefazolin (mics of 2, 0.032, 0.125, and >256 microg/ml, respectively) and produced an inducible beta-lactamase. cefotaxime-resistant mutants (mic, 32 microg/ml) that showed constitutive beta-lactamase production could be selected in vitro. the gene coding for the cephalosporinase of a. enteropelogenes atcc 49803 was cloned, and  its biochemical properties were investigated. escherichia coli transformants showing resistance to various beta-lactams carried a 3.5-kb plasmid insert whose  sequence revealed a 1,146-bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a class c beta-lactamase, named tru-1, showing the highest identity scores with a. punctata cav-1 (75%), a. salmonicida ampc (75%), and a. hydrophila ceph (71%). the bla(tru-1) locus includes open reading frames (orfs) showing significant homology with genes found in the genomes of other aeromonas species, although it exhibits  a different organization, as reflected by the presence of additional orfs located downstream of the beta-lactamase gene in the a. hydrophila and a. salmonicida genomes. specific pcr assays were negative for cpha-like and bla(oxa-12)-like genes in three a. enteropelogenes atcc strains. purified tru-1 showed a broad substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, and, although with significantly lower turnover rates, oxyiminocephalosporins. cephaloridine and cefepime were poorly recognized by the  enzyme, as reflected by the high k(m) values observed with these substrates. thus far, a. enteropelogenes represents the only known example of an aeromonas species that produces only one beta-lactamase belonging to molecular class c.

TI  == genetic insertions and diversification of the polb-type dna polymerase (gp43) of  t4-related phages.
AB  == in escherichia coli phage t4 and many of its phylogenetic relatives, gene 43 consists of a single cistron that encodes a polb family (polb-type) dna polymerase. we describe the divergence of this phage gene and its protein product (gp43) (gene product 43) among 26 phylogenetic relatives of t4 and discuss our observations in the context of diversity among the widely distributed polb enzymes in nature. in two t4 relatives that grow in aeromonas salmonicida phages  44rr and 25, gene 43 is fragmented by different combinations of three distinct types of dna insertion elements: (a) a short intercistronic untranslated sequence (ic-uts) that splits the polymerase gene into two cistrons, 43a and 43b, corresponding to n-terminal (gp43a) and c-terminal (gp43b) protein products; (b)  a freestanding homing endonuclease gene (heg) inserted between the ic-uts and the 43b cistron; and (c) a group i intron in the 43b cistron. phage 25 has all three  elements, whereas phage 44rr has only the ic-uts. we present evidence that (a) the split gene of phage 44rr encodes a split dna polymerase consisting of a complex between gp43a and gp43b subunits; (b) the putative heg encodes a double-stranded dna endonuclease that specifically cleaves intron-free homologues of the intron-bearing 43b site; and (c) the group i intron is a self-splicing rna. our results suggest that some freestanding hegs can mediate the homing of introns that do not encode their own homing enzymes. the results also suggest that different insertion elements can converge on a polb gene and evolve into a single integrated system for lateral transfer of polb genetic material. we discuss the possible pathways for the importation of such insertion elements into the genomes of t4-related phages.

AB  == fish epidermal mucus contains innate immune components that provide a first line  of defense against various infectious pathogens. this study reports the bioassay-guided fractionation and characterization of a novel antimicrobial peptide, myxinidin, from the acidic epidermal mucus extract of hagfish (myxine glutinosa l.). edman sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that myxinidin consists of 12 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 1,327.68 da. myxinidin showed activity against a broad range of bacteria and yeast pathogens at minimum  bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 microg/ml. screened pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium c610, escherichia coli d31, aeromonas salmonicida a449, yersinia ruckeri 96-4, and listonella anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to myxinidin at the mbc of 1.0-2.5 microg/ml; staphylococcus epidermis c621 and yeast (candida albicans c627) had an mbc of 10.0 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of myxinidin was found to be two to 16 times more active than a potent fish-derived antimicrobial peptide, pleurocidin (nrc-17), against most of the screened pathogens. the microbicidal activity of myxinidin was retained in the presence of sodium chloride (nacl) at concentrations up to 0.3 m and had no hemolytic activity against mammalian red blood cells. these results suggest that myxinidin may have potential applications in fish and human therapeutics.

TI  == expression profiles of cytokines released in intestinal epithelial cells of the rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss, in response to bacterial infection.
AB  == to determine whether fish intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) contribute to mucosal immunity, we established a method for isolating iecs from the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss and examined cytokine production in these cells. components of the intestinal epithelium were released by incubation of intestinal pieces with 1mm dithiothreitol (dtt)/ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta). the iec-rich fraction (purity >90%; survival rate approximately 95%) was obtained by  centrifugation on a 35%/40% percoll gradient, followed by magnetic cell sorting using an anti-trout igm antiserum. the gene expression profiles of 14 cytokines in trout iecs were investigated after culturing the cells for 6h with or without  the pathogenic bacterium aeromonas salmonicida. trout iecs could produce several  cytokines, of which il-1beta and tnfalpha2 were upregulated when the cells were stimulated with live a. salmonicida. immunohistochemical analyses with the anti-trout tnf antibody confirmed that the tnf protein was present in the iecs of trout that were intra-anally challenged with live a. salmonicida. these results show that trout iecs are an important trigger of the intestinal immune system. further, formalin-killed a. salmonicida, conditioned medium of this bacterium, or live nonpathogenic escherichia coli could not upregulate the expression of these  cytokines. these results indicate that the production of inflammatory cytokines by iecs is caused by the adhesion of a. salmonicida, but is not due to only simple ligand-receptor interactions between the surface molecules of iecs and the bacterium or in response to bacterial secretions.

TI  == identification of heme uptake genes in the fish pathogen aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, the causative agent of furunculosis in  fish, can use heme as the sole iron source. we applied the fur titration assay to isolate a cluster including six genes hutazxbcd that showed similarity to heme uptake genes of other gram-negative bacteria, and three genes orf123 of unknown function. the spatial organization of these nine genes, arranged in five transcriptional units, was similar to that of a homologous cluster in a. hydrophila. when a tonb system was provided, this cluster allowed escherichia coli 101esd (an ent mutant, unable to synthesize enterobactin) to utilize hemin and hemoglobin as iron sources. mutation of hutb, a gene that encodes a predicted periplasmic hemin-binding protein, caused a drastic defect in the ability of a. salmonicida to grow with hemin as unique source of iron. interestingly, a mutant  for huta gene (encoding the outer membrane hemin receptor) showed initially a reduced ability to grow with hemin as sole iron source, but after 24 h it achieved growth levels similar to parental strain. thus mutation of huta could not abolish the growth with hemin as iron source, suggesting that redundant outer membrane heme transport functions might be encoded in the a. salmonicida genome.

TI  == transferable, multiple antibiotic and mercury resistance in atlantic canadian isolates of aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is associated with carriage  of an inca/c plasmid similar to the salmonella enterica plasmid psn254.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to examine the molecular basis for multiple antibiotic and mercury resistance in canadian isolates of aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. methods: phenotypic and genotypic methods were employed to identify plasmid-associated antibiotic and mercury resistance genes and to determine the organization of those genes in multidrug-resistant (mdr) a. salmonicida isolates. results: the mdr phenotype was transferable via conjugation using escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila and edwardseilla tarda as recipients. antibiotic and mercury resistance genes were carried by a conjugative inca/c plasmid. three distinct antibiotic resistance cassettes were characterized; first a class i integron containing an aada7 gene encoding for an  aminoglycoside-3'-adenyltransferase, the second cassette showed 99.9% nucleotide  sequence homology to a cassette previously identified in the salmonella enterica  inca/c plasmid psn254, containing flor, teta, sulii and stra/strb sequences. the  third cassette showed 100% nucleotide sequence similarity to a transposon-like element, containing a bla(cmy-2) beta-lactamase in association with suge and blc  sequences. this element is known to be widely distributed among clinical and food-borne salmonella and other enterobacteriaceae throughout asia and the united states. mercury resistance was linked to the presence of a mer operon that showed 100% nucleotide sequence homology to the mer operon carried by plasmid psn254. conclusions: each mdr a. salmonicida isolate carried the same plasmid, which was  related to plasmid psn254. this is the first report of plasmid-mediated florfenicol-resistant a. salmonicida in north america. in addition, it is the first report of a plasmid-associated ampc beta-lactamase sequence in a member of  the aeromonadaceae.

TI  == recombinant production and characterization of the carbohydrate recognition domain from atlantic salmon c-type lectin receptor c (sclrc).
AB  == the atlantic salmon c-type lectin receptor c (sclrc) locus encodes a potential oligomeric type ii receptor. c-type lectins recognize carbohydrates in a ca(2+)-dependent manner through structurally conserved, yet functionally diverse, c-type lectin-like domains (ctlds). many conserved amino acids in animal ctlds are present in sclrc, with the notable exception of an asparagine crucially involved in ca(2+)- and carbohydrate-binding, which is tyrosine in sclrc. sclrc also contains six cysteines that form three disulfide bonds. although sclrc was originally identified as an up-regulated transcript responding to aeromonas salmonicida infection, the biological role of this protein is still unknown. to study the structure and ligand binding properties of sclrc, we created a homology model of the 17kda ctld and produced it as an affinity-tagged protein in the periplasm of escherichia coli by co-expression of proteins that facilitate disulfide bond formation. the recombinant form of sclrc was characterized by a protease protection assay, a solid-phase carbohydrate-binding assay, and frontal  affinity chromatography. on the basis of this characterization, we classify sclrc as a c-type lectin that binds to mannose and its derivatives.

TI  == antibacterial action of l-amino acid oxidase from the skin mucus of rockfish sebastes schlegelii.
AB  == l-amino acid oxidase (lao) shows broadly antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by h(2)o(2) generated in the oxidative process of l-amino acids. however, lao (termed ssap) isolated from the rockfish sebastes schlegelii skin mucus acted selectively on gram-negative bacteria. therefore, this study was undertaken to clarify the antibacterial action of ssap  as compared with h(2)o(2). ssap inhibited potently the growth of aeromonas salmonicida, photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida and vibrio parahaemolyticus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.078, 0.16 and 0.63 microg/ml,  respectively. h(2)o(2) inhibited the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with an mic ranging from 0.31 to 2.5 mm. when ssap was incubated with p. damselae subsp. piscicida and escherichia coli, ssap was demonstrated to bind to p. damselae subsp. piscicida but not to e. coli by western blotting and lao activity measurement. these results show that the bacteria binding activity may be involved in the bacterial cell selectivity of ssap. electron microscopic observation of a. salmonicida, p. damselae subsp. piscicida and v. parahaemolyticus revealed that the treatments with ssap and h(2)o(2) induced cell surface damage to a. salmonicida, remarkable elongation of  p. damselae subsp. piscicida bodies and pores into v. parahaemolyticus cells.

TI  == biological characterization of a new type iii secretion system effector from a clinical isolate of aeromonas hydrophila-part ii.
AB  == we recently identified a novel type iii secretion system (t3ss) effector, aexu, from a diarrheal isolate ssu of aeromonas hydrophila, and demonstrated that mice  infected with the deltaaexu mutant were significantly protected from mortality. although the nh(2)-terminal domain of this toxin exhibits homology to aext of a.  salmonicida, a fish pathogen, and exot/s of pseudomonas aeruginosa, the cooh-terminal domain of aexu is unique, with no homology to any known proteins in the ncbi database. in this study, we purified the full-length aexu and its nh(2)-terminal (amino acid residues 1-231) and cooh-terminal (amino acid residues 232-512) domains after expression of their corresponding genes in escherichia coli as histidine-tag fusion proteins using the bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase/promoter-based pet-30a vector system. the full-length and nh(2)- and cooh-terminal domains of aexu exhibited adp-ribosyltransferase activity, with the former two exhibiting much higher activity than the latter. these different forms of aexu were also successfully expressed and produced in the hela tet-off cell system using a pbi-egfp vector, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blot analysis, and intracellular staining of the toxin using flow cytometric analysis. production of aexu in hela cells resulted in possible actin reorganization and cell rounding, as determined by phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy. based on electron microscopy, the toxin also caused chromatin condensation, which is indicative of  apoptosis. apoptosis of hela cells expressing and producing aexu was confirmed by 7-amino actinomycin d (7-aad) and mtt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl  tetrasodium bromide] assays, by detection of cytoplasmic histone-associated dna fragments, and by activation of caspases 3 and 9. these effects were much more pronounced in host cells that expressed and produced the full-length or nh(2)-terminal domain of aexu, compared to those that expressed and produced the  cooh-terminal domain or the vector alone. this study represents the first characterization of this novel t3ss effector.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == genetic diversity among five t4-like bacteriophages.
AB  == background: bacteriophages are an important repository of genetic diversity. as one of the major constituents of terrestrial biomass, they exert profound effects on the earth's ecology and microbial evolution by mediating horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and controlling their growth. only limited genomic sequence data are currently available for phages but even this reveals an overwhelming diversity in their gene sequences and genomes. the contribution of the t4-like phages to this overall phage diversity is difficult to assess, since  only a few examples of complete genome sequence exist for these phages. our analysis of five t4-like genomes represents half of the known t4-like genomes in  genbank. results: here, we have examined in detail the genetic diversity of the genomes of five relatives of bacteriophage t4: the escherichia coli phages rb43,  rb49 and rb69, the aeromonas salmonicida phage 44rr2.8t (or 44rr) and the aeromonas hydrophila phage aeh1. our data define a core set of conserved genes common to these genomes as well as hundreds of additional open reading frames (orfs) that are nonconserved. although some of these orfs resemble known genes from bacterial hosts or other phages, most show no significant similarity to any  known sequence in the databases. the five genomes analyzed here all have similarities in gene regulation to t4. sequence motifs resembling t4 early and late consensus promoters were observed in all five genomes. in contrast, only two of these genomes, rb69 and 44rr, showed similarities to t4 middle-mode promoter sequences and to the t4 mota gene product required for their recognition. in addition, we observed that each phage differed in the number and assortment of putative genes encoding host-like metabolic enzymes, trna species, and homing endonucleases. conclusion: our observations suggest that evolution of the t4-like phages has drawn on a highly diverged pool of genes in the microbial world. the t4-like phages harbour a wealth of genetic material that has not been identified  previously. the mechanisms by which these genes may have arisen may differ from those previously proposed for the evolution of other bacteriophage genomes.

AB  == a multiple laboratory study was conducted in accordance with the standards established by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls), for the development of quality control (qc) ranges using dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for bacterial isolates from aquatic animal species. qc ranges were established for escherichia coli atcc 25922 and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida atcc 33658 when testing at 22, 28 and 35 degrees c (e. coli only) for 10 different antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, flumequine, gentamicin, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine, oxolinic acid, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) qc ranges were determined using dry- and frozen-form 96-well plates and cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. these qc ranges were accepted by the clsi/nccls subcommittee on veterinary antimicrobial susceptibility testing in january 2004. this broth microdilution testing method represents the first standardized method for determining mics of bacterial isolates whose preferred growth temperatures are below 35 degrees c. methods and  qc ranges defined in this study will enable aquatic animal disease researchers to reliably compare quantitative susceptibility testing data between laboratories, and will be used to ensure both precision and inter-laboratory harmonization.

TI  == a c1q-binding 40 kda porin from aeromonas salmonicida: cloning, sequencing, role  in serum susceptibility and fish immunoprotection.
AB  == a 40 kda c1q-binding outer membrane protein from aeromonas salmonicida was identified by direct-binding assay with biotinylated c1q, a subcomponent of the complement classical pathway component c1. the 40 kda porin structural gene from  the a450 a. salmonicida typical strain (a+:o+) was cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. the amino acid sequence of the 40 kda a. salmonicida porin, its ability to bind c1q in an antibody independent process, and its immunological cross-reaction with the a. hydrophila ah-3 porin ii, allow us to determine the role of this protein in serum susceptibility. furthermore, we obtained defined a. salmonicida 40 kda porin insertion mutants in serum sensitive or resistant strains, and we complemented these mutants with a plasmid harboring only the 40 kda porin gene from a. salmonicida a450 in order to define its role as an important surface molecule involved in serum susceptibility and c1q binding. similar complementation was obtained using the a. hydrophila ah-3 porin ii gene.  the 40 kda porin gene and/or protein was present in all the a. salmonicida typical or atypical strains tested. furthermore, the a. hydrophila ah-3 porin ii  seems to be an important molecule for fish immunoprotection against either a. salmonicida or a. hydrophila strains.

AB  == atypical psychrophilic aeromonas salmonicida isolates were obtained from farmed and wild fish in northeastern north america. these bacteria were isolated between 1992 and 2001 and carried tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) plasmids of approximately 58 kb. the nine isolates had plasmids which could be divided into four groups based on the specific tetracycline resistance (tet) gene carried [tet(a) or tet(b)], incompatibility of the plasmid [incu or other], whether the plasmid carried the is6100 sequences, the sul1 gene, coding for sulfonamide resistance, the dfra16 gene, coding for trimethoprim resistance, and/or carried a complete tn1721, and their ability to transfer their tc(r) plasmids to an escherichia coli recipient at 15 degrees c. five of the isolates, with genetically related tc(r) plasmids, were able to transfer their plasmids to an e. coli recipient at frequencies ranging from 5.7x10(-4) to 2.8x10(-6) per recipient. the 1992 isolate carried a genetically distinct plasmid, which transferred at a slightly higher rate. the three remaining isolates carried one of two genetically different plasmids, which were unable to transfer to an e. coli recipient. conjugal transfer at 15 degrees c is the lowest temperature that  has been documented in bacteria.

TI  == bass hepcidin synthesis, solution structure, antimicrobial activities and synergism, and in vivo hepatic response to bacterial infections.
AB  == bass hepcidin was purified from the gill of hybrid striped bass (morone chrysops  x morone saxatilis) based on antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. this 21-amino acid peptide has 8 cysteines engaged in 4 disulfide bonds and is very similar to human hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide with iron regulatory properties. to gain insight into potential role(s) of bass hepcidin in innate immunity in fish, we synthesized the peptide, characterized its antimicrobial activities in vitro, determined its solution structure by nmr, and quantified hepatic gene expression in vivo following infection of bass with the fish pathogens, streptococcus iniae or aeromonas salmonicida. its structure is very similar to that of human hepcidin, including the presence of an antiparallel beta-sheet, a conserved disulfide-bonding pattern, and a rare vicinal disulfide bond. synthetic bass hepcidin was active in vitro against gram-negative pathogens and fungi but showed no activity against key gram-positive pathogens and a single yeast strain tested. hepcidin was non-hemolytic at microbicidal concentrations and had lower specific activity than moronecidin, a broad spectrum, amphipathic,  alpha-helical, antimicrobial peptide constitutively expressed in bass gill tissue. good synergism between the bacterial killing activities of hepcidin and moronecidin was observed in vitro. hepcidin gene expression in bass liver increased significantly within hours of infection with gram-positive (s. iniae) or gram-negative (a. salmonicida) pathogens and was 4-5 orders of magnitude above base-line 24-48 h post-infection. our results suggest that hepcidin plays a key role in the antimicrobial defenses of bass and that its functions are potentially conserved between fish and human.

TI  == differential proteomic analysis of aeromonas salmonicida outer membrane proteins  in response to low iron and in vivo growth conditions.
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis, a serious infectious disease of salmonids. bacterial phenotypes are known to change in vivo compared to the in vitro state. proteomic analysis of in  vivo phenotypes is usually not possible due to insufficient biomass. using an in  vivo growth chamber model, the pathogenic fish bacterium a. salmonicida was cultured in pure culture in vivo in its host, the atlantic salmon, to obtain sufficient biomass to allow proteomic analysis. growth of a. salmonicida under in vitro iron-restricted conditions resulted in the expression of outer membrane proteins of 73, 76 and 85 kda, which were not present when grown under in vitro iron-replete conditions. mass spectrometry analysis identified the 73 kda protein as a colicin receptor, the 76 kda protein as an outer membrane heme receptor, and the 85 kda protein as a ferric siderophore receptor. when cultured in vivo, a. salmonicida up-regulated the identical 73, 76 and 85 kda proteins. the results of this study also suggest, at least with respect to the outer membrane proteins, that the in vitro iron-restricted growth model largely reproduces the results obtained from growth of a. salmonicida within the peritoneal cavity of salmon.

AB  == we analysed the influence of various bacteria on the in vitro growth of trophozoites of a platyamoeba strain isolated from diseased gill tissues of cultured turbot. little or no growth was shown by amoebae cultured in the presence of (1) the turbot-pathogenic bacteria vibrio anguillarum, aeromonas salmonicida or streptococcus sp., (2) pasteurella piscicida or vibrio vulnificus  (pathogenic for some fishes but not turbot), or (3) the non-pathogenic 'environmental' bacteria vibrio campbelli, vibrio fluvialis or pseudomonas dondorofii. the only bacteria which were successfully utilized as food sources were aeromonas hydrophila (pathogenic for some fishes but not turbot) and the non-pathogens vibrio natriegens, pseudomonas nautica and escherichia coli. these  results suggest that the colonization of the gills of cultured turbot by the epizoic amoeba platyamoeba may be an indicator of faecal contamination.

TI  == characterization of class 1 integrons associated with r-plasmids in clinical aeromonas salmonicida isolates from various geographical areas.
AB  == class 1 integrons were found in 26 of 40 antibiotic-resistant isolates of the fish pathogen aeromonas salmonicida from northern europe and north america. three different dhfr genes, conferring trimethoprim resistance, and one ant(3")1a aminoglycoside resistance gene were identified as gene inserts. the gene cassettes tended to be conserved among isolates from a particular geographical area. nineteen isolates transferred r-plasmids carrying different tet determinants to escherichia coli in filter mating assays, and in 15 cases, the class 1 integrons were co-transferred. transferable sulphadiazine, trimethoprim and streptomycin resistances were invariably encoded by integrons. it thus appears that integron-encoded antibiotic resistance genes contribute substantially to the horizontal spread of antimicrobial resistance within this species, being associated with conjugative plasmids.

TI  == distribution of oxytetracycline resistance plasmids between aeromonads in hospital and aquaculture environments: implication of tn1721 in dissemination of  the tetracycline resistance determinant tet a.
AB  == oxytetracycline-resistant (ot(r)) mesophilic aeromonads were recovered from untreated hospital effluent (72 isolates) and from fish farm hatchery tanks (91 isolates) at sites within the english lake district, cumbria, england. the transfer of ot(r) plasmids from these isolates was investigated. using escherichia coli j53-1 as a recipient, 11 isolates from the hospital site and 6 isolates from the fish farm site transferred ot(r) plasmids (designated pfbaot1 to 17). original isolates were identified using fatty acid methyl ester and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism comparisons as either aeromonas hydrophila hg3 (eight isolates), a. veronii b.v. sobria hg8 (six isolates), and a. caviae hgb5 (one isolate). one isolate remained unidentified, and one could not be assigned a taxonomic designation beyond the genus level. plasmids pfbaot1 to -17 were screened for the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinants tet a to e and tet g. only determinant tet a (10 plasmids) was detected in these plasmids, with 7 tet gene determinants remaining  unclassified. in all cases, tet a was located on a 5.5-kb ecori restriction fragment. hybridization with inc-rep probes n, p, q, w, and u showed pfbaot3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -11, from the hospital environment, to be incu plasmids. further, restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses and dna probing demonstrated that pfbaot plasmids were closely related to incu ot(r) plasmids pasot, pasot2, pasot3, pras1 (originally isolated from a. salmonicida strains from fish farms in scotland and norway, respectively), and pie420 (isolated from  a german hospital e. coli strain). in addition, dna analyses demonstrated that plasmids pras1 and pie420 had identical rflp profiles and that all fragments hybridized to each other. the presence of tetracycline resistance transposon tn1721 in its entirety or in a truncated form in these plasmids was demonstrated. these results provided direct evidence that related tetracycline resistance-encoding plasmids have disseminated between different aeromonas species and e. coli and between the human and aquaculture environments in distinct geographical locations. collectively, these findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the aquaculture and human compartments of the environment behave as a single interactive compartment.

TI  == a major secreted elastase is essential for pathogenicity of aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == aeromonas hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of fatal  hemorrhagic septicemia in rainbow trout. a gene encoding an elastolytic activity, ahyb, was cloned from aeromonas hydrophila ag2 into puc18 and expressed in escherichia coli and in the nonproteolytic species aeromonas salmonicida subsp. masoucida. nucleotide sequence analysis of the ahyb gene revealed an open reading frame of 1,764 nucleotides with coding capacity for a 588-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 62,728. the first 13 n-terminal amino acids of the purified protease completely match those deduced from dna sequence starting at aag (lys-184). this finding indicated that ahyb is synthesized as a preproprotein with a 19-amino-acid signal peptide, a 164-amino-acid n-terminal propeptide, and  a 405-amino-acid intermediate which is further processed into a mature protease and a c-terminal propeptide. the protease hydrolyzed casein and elastin and showed a high sequence similarity to other metalloproteases, especially with the  mature form of the pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (52% identity), helicobacter pylori zinc metalloprotease (61% identity), or proteases from several species of  vibrio (52 to 53% identity). the gene ahyb was insertionally inactivated, and the construct was used to create an isogenic ahyb mutant of a. hydrophila. these first reports of a defined mutation in an extracellular protease of a. hydrophila demonstrate an important role in pathogenesis.

TI  == a-protein from achromogenic atypical aeromonas salmonicida: molecular cloning, expression, purification, and characterization.
AB  == achromogenic atypical aeromonas salmonicida is the causative agent of goldfish ulcer disease. virulence of this bacterium is associated with the production of a paracrystalline outer membrane a-layer protein. the species-specific structural gene for the monomeric form of a-protein was cloned into a pet-3d plasmid in order to express and produce a recombinant form of the protein in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the induced protein was isolated from inclusion bodies by a simple solubilization-renaturation procedure and purified by ion exchange chromatography on q-sepharose to over 95% pure monomeric protein. recombinant a-protein was compared by biochemical, immunological, and molecular methods with  the a-protein isolated from atypical a. salmonicida bacterial cells by the glycine and the membrane extraction methods. the recombinant form was found to be undistinguishable from the wild type when examined by sds-page and gel filtration chromatography. the immunological similarity of the protein samples was demonstrated by employing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in elisa and western blot techniques. all forms of a-protein were found to activate the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from murine macrophage. to date, this represents the first large-scale production of biologically active recombinant a-protein.

AB  == a serum amyloid p-like pentraxin has been isolated from atlantic salmon. salmo salar l., based on its calcium dependent binding to agarose. the subunits of approximately 37 kda were all glycosylated and when covalently linked together formed a pentamer with disulphide bonds between all subunits. a specific rabbit antiserum raised against the pentameric form was used to follow changes in serum  levels of the salmon pentraxin during infection with aeromonas salar and inflammation induced by escherichia coli lps or killed a. salmonicida. the salmon pentraxin level in normal serum was in the range approximately 50-300 microg/ml.  unlike pentraxins from other species, the salmon pentraxin showed only moderate but significant increases or decreases in response to e. coli lps or a. salmonicida infection, respectively. although pentraxins and pentraxin-like proteins are evolutionary conserved, not all pentraxins are acute phase responders suggesting that their most ancestral function(s) are not related to acute phase induction.

TI  == identification and characterization of is2404 and is2606: two distinct repeated sequences for detection of mycobacterium ulcerans by pcr.
AB  == molecular analysis of mycobacterium ulcerans has revealed two new insertion sequences (iss), is2404 and is2606. is2404 was identified by complete sequencing  of a previously described repetitive dna segment from m. ulcerans. this element is 1,274 bp long, contains 12-bp inverted repeats and a single open reading frame (orf) potentially encoding a protein of 327 amino acids (aa), and apparently generates 7-bp direct repeats upon transposition. amino acid similarity was found between the putative transposase and those encoded by iss in other bacterial sequences from aeromonas salmonicida (asis1), escherichia coli (h repeat element), vibrio cholerae (vcis1), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pgis2). the second is, is2606, was discovered by sequence analysis of a haeiii fragment of m. ulcerans genomic dna containing a repetitive sequence. this element is 1,404 bp long, with 12-bp inverted repeats and a single orf potentially encoding a protein of 445 aa. database searches revealed a high degree of amino acid identity (70%)  with the putative transposase of is1554 from m. tuberculosis. significant amino acid identity (40%) was also observed with transposases from several other microorganisms, including rhizobium meliloti (isrm3), burkholderia cepacia (is1356), corynebacterium diphtheriae, and yersinia pestis. pcr screening of dna  from 45 other species of mycobacteria with primers for is2404 confirm that this element is found only in m. ulcerans. however, by pcr, is2606 was also found in mycobacterium lentiflavum, another slow-growing member of the genus mycobacterium that is apparently genetically distinct from m. ulcerans. testing the sensitivity of pcr based on is2404 and is2606 primers demonstrated the ability to detect 0.1  and 1 m. ulcerans genome equivalents, respectively. the ability to detect small numbers of cells by using two gene targets will be particularly useful for analyzing environmental samples, where there may be low concentrations of m. ulcerans among large numbers of other environmental mycobacteria.

TI  == transcriptional regulation and organization of the dcua and dcub genes, encoding  homologous anaerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporters in escherichia coli.
AB  == the dcua and dcub genes of escherichia coli encode homologous proteins that appear to function as independent and mutually redundant c4-dicarboxylate transporters during anaerobiosis. the dcua gene is 117 bp downstream of, and has  the same polarity as, the aspartase gene (aspa), while dcub is 77 bp upstream of, and has the same polarity as, the anaerobic fumarase gene (fumb). to learn more about the respective roles of the dcu genes, the environmental and regulatory factors influencing their expression were investigated by generating and analyzing single-copy dcua- and dcub-lacz transcriptional fusions. the results show that dcua is constitutively expressed whereas dcub expression is highly regulated. the dcub gene is strongly activated anaerobically by fnr, repressed in the presence of nitrate by narl, and subject to cyclic amp receptor protein (crp)-mediated catabolite repression. in addition, dcub is strongly induced by c4-dicarboxylates, suggesting that dcub is under the control of an uncharacterized c4-dicarboxylate-responsive gene regulator. northern blotting confirmed that dcua (and aspa) is expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and that dcub (and fumb) is induced anaerobically. major monocistronic transcripts were identified for aspa and dcua, as well as a minor species possibly corresponding to an aspa-dcua cotranscript. five major transcripts were  observed for dcub and fumb: monocistronic transcripts for both fumb and dcub; a dcub-fumb cotranscript; and two transcripts, possibly corresponding to dcub-fumb  and fumb mrna degradation products. primer extension analysis revealed independent promoters for aspa, dcua, and dcub, but surprisingly no primer extension product could be detected for fumb. the expression of dcub is entirely  consistent with a primary role for dcub in mediating c4-dicarboxylate transport during anaerobic fumarate respiration. the precise physiological purpose of dcua  remains unclear.

AB  == two tandemly located flagellin genes, flaa and flab, with 79% nucleotide sequence identity were identified in aeromonas salmonicida a449. the fla genes are conserved in typical and atypical strains of a. salmonicida, and they display significant divergence at the nucleotide level from the fla genes of the motile species aeromonas hydrophila and aeromonas veronii biotype sobria. flaa and flab  encode unprocessed flagellins with predicted mrs of 32,351 and 32,056, respectively. when cloned under the control of the ptac promoter, flab was highly expressed when induced in escherichia coli dh5alpha, and the flab protein was detectable even in the uninduced state. in flaa clones containing intact upstream sequence, flaa was barely detectable when uninduced and poorly expressed on induction. the a. salmonicida flagellins are antigenically cross-reactive with the a. hydrophila tf7 flagellin(s) and evolutionarily closely related to the flagellins of pseudomonas aeruginosa and vibrio anguillarum. electron microscopy  showed that a. salmonicida a449 expresses unsheathed polar flagella at an extremely low frequency under normal laboratory growth conditions, suggesting the presence of a full complement of genes whose products are required to make flagella; e.g., immediately downstream of flaa and flab are open reading frames encoding flag and flah homologs.

AB  == spent culture supernatants from both aeromonas hydrophila and aeromonas salmonicida activate a range of biosensors responsive to n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls). the genes for a quorum sensing signal generator and a response regulator were cloned from each aeromonas species and termed ahyri and asari, respectively. protein sequence homology analysis places the gene products within  the growing family of luxri homologs. ahyr and asar are transcribed divergently from ahyi and asai, respectively, and in both aeromonas species, the genes downstream have been identified by dna sequence and pcr analysis. downstream of both ahyi and asai is a gene with close homology to icia, an inhibitor of chromosome replication in escherichia coli, a finding which implies that in aeromonas, cell division may be linked to quorum sensing. the major signal molecule synthesized via both ahyi and asai was purified from spent culture supernatants and identified as n-(butanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (bhl) by thin-layer chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, and mass spectrometry. in addition, a second, minor ahl, n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone,  was identified. transcriptional reporter studies with ahyi::luxcdabe fusions indicate that ahyr and bhl are both required for ahyi transcription. for a. salmonicida, although the addition of exogenous bhl gives only a small stimulation of the production of serine protease with comparison to the control culture, the incorporation of a longer-chain ahl, n-(3-oxodecanoyl)-l-homoserine  lactone, reduced the final level (by approximately 50%) and delayed the appearance (from an a650 of 0.9 in the control to an a650 of 1.2 in the test) of  protease in the culture supernatant. these data add a. hydrophila and a. salmonicida to the growing family of gram-negative bacteria now known to control  gene expression through quorum sensing.

TI  == vibrio spp. secrete proaerolysin as a folded dimer without the need for disulphide bond formation.
AB  == proaerolysin is an extracellular dimeric protein that is secreted across the inner and outer membranes of aeromonas spp. in separate steps. to investigate the role of protein folding in the second step, one or more cysteine residues were introduced and the mutant proaerolysins were expressed in aeromonas hydrophila and aeromonas salmonicida, as well as vibrio cholerae. replacing met-41 with cys  resulted in expression of a protein that could form a dimer in which the monomers were linked together by a disulphide bridge. a double mutant was also made, in which gly-202 and ile-445 were replaced with cysteine in order to allow the formation of an intrachain disulphide bridge when the molecule was correctly folded. the m41c covalent dimer and g202c/i445c proaerolysin with the new intrachain bridge were both easily detected inside the bacteria, and they later appeared in the culture supernatants. small amounts of incorrectly folded proaerolysin were also observed in the cells, but they were not secreted. we observed in the cells, but they were not secreted. we conclude that proaerolysin  folds and dimerizes before being released from the cell, and that correct folding is a requirement for secretion to occur. the proton ionophore cccp reduced release of the folded proteins. unoxidized protein was secreted by cells grown in beta-mercaptoethanol and by a dsba mutant of v. cholerae, indicating that disulphide bond formation may not be essential for release.

AB  == a protein with an apparent m(r) of 28,000 was isolated from outer membrane preparations of aeromonas salmonicida a440. the protein was tested for the ability to form pores, using a planar lipid bilayer model membrane system. the protein appeared to be a monomer with a single-channel conductance in 1.0 m kcl of 1.96 ns and a cation/anion permeability ratio of 2.91 +/- 0.68. these data show that the porin channel is comparable in size to ompc and ompf of escherichia coli and is relatively nonselective, having some preference for cations over anions. the porin was purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a polyclonal antibody was raised. immunoblot analysis showed that an immunologically cross-reactive protein was present in other aeromonas strains but not in strains of vibrio or yersinia. the  n-terminal amino acid sequence of the porin was determined and was found to show  some homology to an aeromonas hydrophila outer membrane protein. this is the second porin species of a. salmonicida to be described, and it differs from the other in subunit molecular weight, aggregation properties, peptidoglycan association, pore size, and antigenicity. rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) immunized intraperitoneally with the purified porin protein were significantly protected from experimental a. salmonicida challenge. this is the first report of successful vaccination against a. salmonicida with a purified outer membrane component.

TI  == the leucine zipper of aeromonas salmonicida abca is required for the transcriptional activation of the p2 promoter of the surface-layer structural gene, vapa, in escherichia coli.
AB  == the aeromonas salmonicida abca protein is involved in the synthesis of the o-polysaccharide side-chains on the lipopolysaccharide and is also capable of enhancing the expression of the structural gene for the a-layer, vapa, when cloned into escherichia coli. the p2 promoter of the vapa gene of a. salmonicida  was cloned into a promoter probe vector and expression in e. coli was monitored.  the expression of p2::lacz was shown to be increased when abca was provided in trans. abca contains an n-terminal atp-binding domain as well as a c-terminal leucine zipper domain. site-directed mutagenesis has been used to show that the atp-binding domain is required for the synthesis of the o-polysaccharide side-chains, but not for the enhancement of vapa expression. conversely, the leucine zipper is needed for the increase in vapa expression, but not for o-polysaccharide side-chain synthesis. this indicates that abca is a bifunctional protein that can influence the synthesis of the two principle antigenic components of the a. salmonicida cell surface.

AB  == a novel insertion sequence, designated is1070, was identified on the lactose plasmid of leuconostoc lactis nz6009 by nucleotide sequence analysis. the 1027-bp sequence contains partially matched (24 of 28 bp) inverted repeats and has one long open reading frame. the deduced 305-amino-acid sequence demonstrated homology to transposases of is30 from escherichia coli, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus, is1161 from streptococcus salivarius, isas2 from aeromonas salmonicida and a putative protein encoded by orf3 of virus spv1-r8a2 b from spiroplasma citri. at least fifteen is1070-like sequences were detected in the genome of the parent lc. lactis strain and five of these were situated on plasmids. analysis of the direct repeats of two of these copies with that of is1070 revealed differences in the target duplication lengths.

TI  == the plasmid profiles of fish pathogenic isolates of aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and vibrio ordalii from the atlantic and pacific coasts of canada.
AB  == the plasmid profiles of oxytetracycline- and streptomycin-resistant isolates of aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and vibrio ordalii were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. bacterial isolates were from disease outbreaks in fish on the atlantic and pacific coasts. resistant isolates were examined when grown in the presence and absence of antibiotic. alkaline lysis methods were used for plasmid isolation. vibrio spp. were predominantly plasmidless, except for a 47-kilobase (kb) plasmid. atlantic coast isolates of a. salmonicida possessed four or six plasmids, with four smaller plasmids ranging in size from 4.3 to 8.1  kb being consistently observed. the plasmid profiles of antibiotic-sensitive atcc strains were identical. the plasmid profiles of the pacific coast isolates of a.  salmonicida varied slightly from those of the atlantic coast isolates with six plasmids observed, ranging in size from 4.2 to 8.9 kb. resistance to the antibiotics was not altered following plasmid curing experiments and resistance was not transferable to escherichia coli. thus, resistance to oxytetracycline and streptomycin did not appear to be plasmid mediated.

TI  == tyrosine phosphorylation of the tetragonal paracrystalline array of aeromonas hydrophila: molecular cloning and high-level expression of the s-layer protein gene.
AB  == high virulence strains of the fish pathogenic bacterium aeromonas hydrophila produce a tetragonally arranged paracrystalline surface protein array (s-layer).  the gene (ahsa) encoding the s-protein subunit of a. hydrophila tf7 was cloned into lambda embl 3, and sub-cloned into puc 18. transformation into escherichia coli led to stable high-level expression of full-size s-protein under the control of its native promoter. the dna sequence revealed a 1406 base-pair open reading frame encoding a protein consisting of a 19 amino acid residue signal peptide, and a 448 residue 45,400 da molecular mass mature protein with a predicted isoelectric point (pi) of 6.72 compared with the measured m(r) of 52,000 and pi of 4.6. this suggested that the s-protein was post-translationally modified and in vivo cell labelling with [32p]orthophosphate, acid phosphatase digestion of s-protein, ascending thin-layer chromatography of partially acid hydrolysed s-protein and western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that the s-protein of strain tf7 contained phosphotyrosine. s-proteins produced by the other strains of motile aeromonads tested also reacted with this  anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. cell fractionation studies employing plasmid-encoded ahsa showed that in a. hydrophila the s-protein subunits were secreted across the outer membrane by the native s-protein secretion pathway, while in e. coli and a. salmonicida the cloned a. hydrophila s-protein inserted into the outer membrane of the foreign host. these findings indicate that the process employed to translocate aeromonas s-proteins across the outer membrane is highly specific.

TI  == phagocytic defence mechanism in sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax l.): an ultrastructural study.
AB  == background: the ultrastructure of the phagocytic process in fish has not been established in spite of the significant morphofunctional differences detected in  the fish immune system with respect to the basic immunological pattern in vertebrates. we report the ultrastructure of the bacterial phagocytic defence mechanism in sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax l.). methods: head-kidney, blood, and peritoneal exudate leukocytes were challenged with aeromonas salmonicida and escherichia coli and processed for transmission electron microscopic study. results: macrophages challenged with bacteria showed changes in the cell outline, in the chromatin pattern, and in the ultrastructural features of the cytoplasm as a consequence of an activation process. the phagocytic process consists of the following: 1) bacteria-macrophage contact. one or more spot contacts between the  bacterial wall and the phagocyte membrane are observed. 2) bacteria engulfment. slight depressions, membrane invaginations, or cytoplasmic processes are formed at the phagocyte surface. macrophage processes occasionally surround the bacteria, overlapping and roaming parallel, or a single, long pseudopod encircles a bacterium several times. 3) endocytic vesicle formation. macrophages show one or more bacteria inside membrane-bound cytoplasmic vesicles. 4) phagolysosome formation. some dense granules (lysosomes) fuse with the endocytic vesicle. 5) intracellular killing/digestion. bacteria inside the endocytic vesicles are observed both virtually intact or damaged at different digestion stages. conclusions: sea bass macrophages possess the mechanisms necessary to both engulf and kill bacteria. cellular and subcellular events in the morphology of phagocytosis and lysosomal dissolution of bacteria fit the general pattern described for mammals.

TI  == transfer of multiple drug resistance plasmids between bacteria of diverse origins in natural microenvironments.
AB  == plasmids harboring multiple antimicrobial-resistance determinants (r plasmids) were transferred in simulated natural microenvironments from various bacterial pathogens of human, animal, or fish origin to susceptible strains isolated from a different ecological niche. r plasmids in a strain of the human pathogen vibrio cholerae o1 e1 tor and a bovine escherichia coli strain were conjugated to a susceptible strain of the fish pathogenic bacterium aeromonas salmonicida subsp.  salmonicida in marine water. conjugations of r plasmids between a resistant bovine pathogenic e. coli strain and a susceptible e. coli strain of human origin were performed on a hand towel contaminated with milk from a cow with mastitis. a similar conjugation event between a resistant porcine pathogenic e. coli strain of human origin was studied in minced meat on a cutting board. conjugation of r plasmids between a resistant strain of the fish pathogenic bacterium a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and a susceptible e. coli strain of human origin was performed in raw salmon on a cutting board. r plasmids in a strain of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and a human pathogenic e. coli strain were conjugated to a susceptible porcine e. coli strain in porcine feces. transfer of  the different r plasmids was confirmed by plasmid profile analyses and determination of the resistance pattern of the transconjugants. the different r plasmids were transferred equally well under simulated natural conditions and under controlled laboratory conditions, with median conjugation frequencies ranging from 3 x 10(-6) to 8 x 10(-3). the present study demonstrates that conjugation and transfer of r plasmids is a phenomenon that belongs to the environment and can occur between bacterial strains of human, animal, and fish origins that are unrelated either evolutionarily or ecologically even in the absence of antibiotics. consequently, the contamination of the environment with bacterial pathogens resistant to antimicrobial agents is a real threat not only as a source of disease but also as a source from which r plasmids can easily spread to other pathogens of diverse origins.

TI  == mutagenesis of the paracrystalline surface protein array of aeromonas salmonicida by endogenous insertion elements.
AB  == the tetragonal paracrystalline surface protein array (a-layer) of the fish pathogenic bacterium aeromonas salmonicida is a virulence factor and bacteria which are unable to produce a-layer are attenuated in their ability to kill fish. ten independent mutants of aeromonas salmonicida which were unable to produce a-layer were isolated by growth at 30 degrees c. these mutants displayed either reduced synthesis of the a-layer subunit, synthesis of a truncated subunit, or complete loss of the ability to produce the subunit protein. restriction mapping  and analysis by polymerase chain reaction showed that the mutations had resulted  from insertion of two different insertion sequence (is) elements into different sites in the a-layer subunit gene (vapa) and its promoter. sequence comparisons indicated that isas1 is unique among reported is elements. it is 1223 bp long with imperfect terminal inverted repeats of 22 bp and insertion resulted in a duplicated 8 bp target sequence in vapa. isas1 expressed a 42,000 molecular weight (m(r)) protein in mini-cells. isas2 was 1084 bp long, expressed proteins of m(r) 38,000 and 39,000 in vitro, had imperfect 29 bp terminal inverted repeats and had duplicated a 3 bp target sequence. sequence comparisons indicated that isas2 was also unique to a. salmonicida; however, the proteins encoded by isas2 showed strong homology to the putative transposases encoded by the is30 family of is elements. southern analyses showed that both isas1 and isas2 were restricted to a. salmonicida strains a449 and a450 where they were present in low copy number. the ability of these two is elements to mutate the ability of a. salmonicida to produce its paracrystalline surface array provides a novel method  for the attenuation of virulence.

AB  == tetracycline-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from four different marine sediments in scandinavia and analyzed with dna probes for the determinant  classes a to e. colony hybridizations of 429 isolates revealed that class e is the dominating resistance determinant in these marine sediments. comparison of fecally polluted and unpolluted sediments showed few determinant classes in unpolluted sediment and a complex composition of several determinant classes in polluted sediment. total dna extraction and analysis with dna probes for determinant classes a to e resulted in no hybridization signal, because of the low number of gram-negative tetracycline-resistant bacteria. identification of class e isolates revealed that this determinant is present not only in aeromonas  hydrophila, escherichia coli, and vibrio salmonicida but also in additional strains.

TI  == aeromonas spp. can secrete escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase into the culture supernatant, and its release requires a functional general secretion pathway.
AB  == aerolysin is a channel-forming protein secreted by aeromonas hydrophila. to determine if regions of aerolysin could direct the secretion of another protein,  portions of aera were fused to phoa, the escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase gene and cloned into e. coli, aeromonas salmonicida, and a. hydrophila. we were surprised to find that secretion of the enzyme by both aeromonas spp. was independent of the aerolysin segments fused to it. the smallest fusion product contained only the signal sequence and two amino acids of aerolysin. the largest  had more than 90% of the aerolysin molecule. the fusion proteins were found in the periplasms of e. coli and a. salmonicida grown in lb medium containing glucose, as well as in the shocked cells. aerolysin itself was secreted by a. salmonicida under these conditions. in contrast, when a. salmonicida containing any of the fused genes was grown in lb medium without glucose, most of the alkaline phosphatase activity was extracellular, whereas beta-lactamase remained  in its normal periplasmic location. similar results were obtained with a. hydrophila. the change in location of the enzyme in a. salmonicida appeared to be related to the ph of the growth medium. a. salmonicida and a. hydrophila also secreted native e. coli alkaline phosphatase, but a. hydrophila strains with mutations in the general secretion pathway were unable to release the enzyme. we  conclude that the aeromonas secretion system can recognize the e. coli enzyme as  an extracellular protein and direct it outside the cell.

TI  == host range and transfer efficiency of incompatibility group hi plasmids.
AB  == hi plasmids are distinguished by their thermosensitive mode of conjugation (transfer efficiency is optimal at 22-30 degrees c) and their capacity to encode  multiple antibiotic resistance. these traits have implicated hi plasmids as potential vectors in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic  and indigenous bacterial species in water and soil environments. we compared the  transfer efficiency of hi plasmids with that of plasmids from 13 other incompatibility groups at 37, 24, and 14 degrees c in intragenic conjugations between laboratory strains of escherichia coli k-12 under in vitro conditions. only the hi plasmids and a representative plasmid from incompatibility groups m,  n, p alpha, t, and w were observed to be transmissible at 14 degrees c. these plasmids, along with hi plasmids and the related hii representative, were tested  for their host range and transfer proficiency to enterobacteria species and some  other gram-negative organisms of environmental significance at 24 and 14 degrees  c. notable differences in the host range of hi plasmids compared with plasmid representatives from the other enterobacterial groups were not evident at 24 degrees c. at 14 degrees c, r478 (hi2) displayed the broadest host range and transfer proficiency among the test plasmids. the ability of several plasmid groups, including hi, to transfer at 14-24 degrees c to vibrio cholerae non 01, salmonella typhi, and the fish pathogens aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and yersinia ruckeri needs to be corroborated by in situ studies.

TI  == an aromatic-dependent mutant of the fish pathogen aeromonas salmonicida is attenuated in fish and is effective as a live vaccine against the salmonid disease furunculosis.
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis in salmonid fish.  the disease is responsible for severe economic losses in intensively cultured salmon and trout. bacterin vaccines provide inadequate protection against infection. we have constructed an aromatic-dependent mutant of a. salmonicida in  order to investigate the possibility of an effective live-attenuated vaccine. the aroa gene of a. salmonicida was cloned in escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. the codon usage pattern of aroa was found to be quite distinct from that of the vapa gene coding for the surface array protein layer (a layer). the aroa gene was inactivated by inserting a fragment expressing kanamycin resistance within the coding sequence. the aroa::kar mutation was introduced into the chromosome of virulent a. salmonicida 644rb and 640v2 by allele replacement by using a suicide plasmid delivery system. the aroa mutation  did not revert at a detectable frequency (< 10(-11). the mutation resulted in attenuation when bacteria were injected intramuscularly into atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.). introduction of the wild-type aroa gene into the a. salmonicida mutants on a broad-host-range plasmid restored virulence. a. salmonicida mutant 644rb aroa::kar persisted in the kidney of brown trout (salmo trutta l.) for 12 days at 10 degrees c. vaccination of brown trout with 10(7) cfu of a. salmonicida 644rb aroa by intraperitoneal injection resulted in a 253-fold increase in the 50% lethal dose (ld50) compared with unvaccinated controls challenged with a virulent clinical isolate 9 weeks later. a second vaccination after 6 weeks increased the ld50 by a further 16-fold.

TI  == structure of the tetragonal surface virulence array protein and gene of aeromonas salmonicida.
AB  == the paracrystalline surface protein array of the pathogenic bacterium aeromonas salmonicida is a primary virulence factor with novel binding capabilities. the species-specific structural gene (vapa) for this array protein (a-protein) was cloned into lambda gt11 but was unstable when expressed in escherichia coli, undergoing an 816-base pair deletion due to a 21-base pair direct repeat within the gene. however, the gene was stable in cosmid pla2917 as long as expression was poor. a-protein was located in the cytoplasmic, inner membrane and periplasmic fractions in e. coli. the dna sequence revealed a 1,506-base pair open reading frame encoding a protein consisting of a 21-amino acid signal peptide, and a 481-residue 50,778 molecular weight protein containing considerable secondary structure. when assembled into a paracrystalline protein array on aeromonas the cell surface a-protein was totally refractile to cleavage  by trypsin, but became trypsin sensitive when disassembled. trypsin cleavage of the isolated protein provided evidence that both the nh2- and cooh-terminal regions form distinct structural domains, consistent with three-dimensional ultrastructural evidence. the nh2-terminal 274-residue domain remained refractile to trypsin activity. this segment connects by a trypsin and cnbr-sensitive 78-residue linker region to a cooh-terminal 129-residue fragment which could apparently refold into a partially trypsin-resistant structure after cleavage at  residue 323.

TI  == extracellular secretion of cloned aerolysin and phospholipase by aeromonas salmonicida.
AB  == the promoterless structural genes for aerolysin and the extracellular phospholipase of aeromonas hydrophila were inserted into a multi-host-range expression vector and transferred into aeromonas salmonicida and escherichia coli. in both species, gene expression was under the control of the inducible tac promoter of the vector. neither the phospholipase nor the aerolysin was released  by intact e. coli. instead, both proteins accumulated in the periplasm, leading to reduced growth and eventual cell death. when the aerolysin gene inserted into  the vector contained its own promoter, the toxin was expressed constitutively by  a. salmonicida but not by e. coli. production of aerolysin and the phospholipase  by a. salmonicida did not affect cell growth, and the proteins were correctly processed and exported by intact cells. both proteins could also be detected in the periplasm, where their concentrations were considerably higher then they were outside the cells. periplasmic aerolysin was rapidly released when cells were transferred to fresh medium, indicating that this compartment is part of the normal export pathway and that the protein is not shunted there as a consequence  of overproduction. plasmid-coded aerolysin did not appear to compete with the cell proteins for export components, as even when very large quantities of aerolysin were being exported by a. salmonicida, there was no effect on chromosomal protease release and only a modest reduction in the export of chromosomal phospholipase.

TI  == effects of polymyxin b nonapeptide on aeromonas salmonicida.
AB  == in contrast to polymyxin b-susceptible gram-negative bacteria of human origin, the fish pathogen aeromonas salmonicida was resistant to sensitization by polymyxin b nonapeptide (pmbn) to hydrophobic antibiotics. similarly, sensitization of a. salmonicida strains by pmbn to the bactericidal action of brook trout (salvelinus fontinalis) serum complement was less pronounced than the similar effect of pmbn against other gram-negative bacteria in certain mammalian  sera. the surface array protein (a layer), overlying the outer membrane of virulent a. salmonicida strains, did not appear to cause resistance to pmbn sensitization since an a-layer-deficient mutant showed similar responses to pmbn  as its parent strain. electron micrographs of pmbn-treated a. salmonicida cells revealed very little visible outer membrane disruption when compared with the extensive blebbing on the outer membrane surface caused by pmbn in certain enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli k-37. however, small extracellular vesiclelike components, which may have been derived from the outer membrane, were numerous around pmbn-treated a. salmonicida cells. in this connection, pmbn caused disruption of the a layer in the form of bulges, breaks, and detached fragments which appeared to be associated with the accumulation of these vesicles underneath the a layer of wild-type a. salmonicida strains.

AB  == suicide plasmid pjb4ji, containing transposon tn5 and phage mu, was introduced into aeromonas salmonicida 449 which produces a surface protein array known as the a-layer. kanamycin-resistant exconjugants of 449 with altered ability to produce the a-layer were selected by virtue of their altered colonial morphology  and color on medium containing the dye congo red. analysis of culture supernatants, periplasmic shock fluid, outer membranes, and whole-cell lysates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to a-protein revealed five classes of single-insertion mutations that affected the ability of cells to produce and export a-protein and  to assemble the a-layer. these studies suggest that a-protein is produced from a  single chromosomal gene. the subunits subsequently pass through the periplasm and across the outer membrane. at least one gene product is required for this export. assembly of a-layer on the cell surface then requires the presence of o polysaccharide chains on the lipopolysaccharide. in one case, insertion of tn5 resulted in loss of ability to produce both a-protein and lipopolysaccharide with o polysaccharide chains, suggesting that synthesis of a-protein and synthesis of  lipopolysaccharide may involve coordinate regulation.

TI  == interaction of pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae plasmids in aeromonas salmonicida.
AB  == we observed that aeromonas salmonicida aro200 will maintain either or both the pseudomonas r-factor, pmg1, and enterobacteriaceae r-factors. this bacterial strain, therefore, provides a unique background wherein the host ranges of pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae plasmods overlap. co-maintenance of these plasmids resulted in behavior of plasmid aggregates that allowed transfer of r-dterminants beyond the host range of the parent plasmid. we observed that the aro200 genetic background facilitated the redistribution of b determinants among  unrelated and conjugally noninterfertile gram-negative bacteria. aberrant behavior resulting in the deletion of r-determinants for plasmids singly maintained in aro200 was also observed. plasmids studied included rp1, r702, incp; rs-a, incw; r192.7, incfii; r64-11, inci; r390, incn; and r6k, incx.

TI  == production by aeromonas of common enterobacterial antigen and its possible taxonomic significance.
AB  == in a study of production of the common enterobacterial antigen (ca) by members of the aeromonas group, ten strains of a. shigelloides, nine strains of a. hydrophila, and nine strains of a. salmonicida were used. passive hemagglutination and hemolysis tests as well as the hemagglutination-inhibition procedure revealed that all strains of a. shigelloides, in contrast to the strains of the other two species, produce this antigenic determinant. the antigen of a. shigelloides was demonstrated even when the supernatant fluids of agar-grown cultures were used in a dilution of 1:1,000, whereas 10-times concentrated supernatant fluids obtained from the other two species were negative. supernatant liquids of cultures of a. shigelloides failed to induce a significant ca immune response in rabbits; nonetheless, the animals were primed immunologically and responded with prompt production of ca antibodies in significant titers to a booster injection of a subeffective dose of ca obtained from salmonella typhimurium. strains of a. hydrophila and a. salmonicida neither  induced ca antibody formation nor primed the animals. it is concluded that of the three species of the aeromonas group only a. shigelloides, which may produce o antigen cross-reacting with shigella sonnei and which has been isolated from patients with dysentery or gastroenteritis, produces ca. production of this antigen, therefore, may help to characterize microorganisms belonging or related  to the family enterobacteriaceae.
