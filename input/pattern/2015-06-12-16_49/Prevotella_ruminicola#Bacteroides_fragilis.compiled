TI  - Sequence analysis of the plasmid pRRI2 from the rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola 223/M2/7 and the use of pRRI2 in Prevotella/Bacteroides Shuttle Vectors.
AB  - pRRI2 is a small cryptic plasmid from the rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola 223/M2/7 which has been used for the construction of shuttle vectors (pRH3 and pRRI207) that replicate in many Bacteroides/Prevotella strains as well as in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of pRRI2 reveals that it is a 3240-bp plasmid carrying two clear open reading frames. Rep, encoded by ORF1, shows 48 and 47% amino acid sequence identity with RepA proteins from Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides fragilis, respectively. ORF2, named Pre, shares 34% amino acid sequence identity with a putative plasmid recombination protein from the Flavobacterium spp. plasmid pFL1 and 30% amino acid sequence identity with BmpH from B. fragilis Tn5520. Disruption of ORF1 with HindIII prevents replication and maintenance in Bacteroides spp. hosts, but shuttle vectors carrying pRRI2 interrupted within ORF2, by EcoRI*, are able to replicate. pRRI2 shows no significant similarity with the only other P. ruminicola plasmid to have been studied previously, pRAM4.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and complementation analysis of the recA gene from Prevotella ruminicola.
AB  - Degenerate PCR primers based on conserved RecA protein regions were used to amplify a portion of recA [corrected] from Prevotella ruminicola strain 23, which was used as a probe to isolate the full-length recA gene from the P. ruminicola genomic library. The P. ruminicola recA gene encoded a protein of 340 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.81 kDa, P. ruminicola RecA was highly similar to other RecA proteins and most closely resembled that of Bacteroides fragilis (75% identity). It alleviated the methyl methanesulfonate and mitomycin C sensitivities of Escherichia coli recA mutants, but did not restore the resistance to UV-light irradiation. Mitomycin C treatment of otherwise isogenic E. coli strains showed a higher level of prophage induction in a recA harboring lysogen.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - Evidence for natural transfer of a tetracycline resistance gene between bacteria  from the human colon and bacteria from the bovine rumen.
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated conjugal transfer of a specially constructed shuttle  vector, pRDB5, from the human colonic anaerobe Bacteroides uniformis to the ruminal anaerobe Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola B(1)4. We have now shown that naturally occurring gene transfer elements in Bacteroides species and Prevotella ruminicola can also be transferred between these two genera. A self-transmissible chromosomal element originally found in a clinical isolate of Bacteroides fragilis (Tcr Emr 12256) was transferred from B. uniformis 0061 to P. ruminicola B(1)4 and from P. ruminicola B(1)4 back to B. uniformis or to another human colonic species, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Similarly, a conjugative plasmid (pRRI4) originally found in P. ruminicola 223 was transferred from P. ruminicola B(1)4 to B. uniformis or B. thetaiotaomicron. pRRI4 could be transferred from the colonic Bacteroides species only if the donor strain contained the Tcr Emr 12256 element in its chromosome. These results show that transfer of naturally occurring elements can be demonstrated under laboratory conditions. Evidence that such transfers may actually have occurred in nature came from our finding that the tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene on the P. ruminicola plasmid pRRI4 hybridized on high-stringency Southern blots with the Tcr gene found on the Bacteroides Tcr elements. The presence of the same gene in such distantly related genera of bacteria is most likely to have occurred as a result of horizontal transfer.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
