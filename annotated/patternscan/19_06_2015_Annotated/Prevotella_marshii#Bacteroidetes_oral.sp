TI  == prevotella saccharolytica sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two strains of anaerobic, gram-stain-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity (d033b-12-2(t) and d080a-01) were subjected to a comprehensive range  of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to be distinct from any previously described species. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strains were related most closely to the type strain of prevotella marshii (93.5  % sequence identity). the novel strains were saccharolytic and produced acetic acid and succinic acid as end products of fermentation. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids were c(1)(6) :(0)), iso-c(1)(4):(0), c(1)(4):(0), anteiso-c(1)(5):(0), iso-c(1)(6) :(0) and c(1)(6):(0)) 3-oh. the g+c content of the dna of strain d033b-12-2(t) was 44 mol%. strains d033b-12-2(t) and d080a-01 are considered to represent a single novel species of the genus prevotella, for which the name prevotella saccharolytica sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is d033b-12-2(t) (=dsm 22473(t) =ccug 57944(t)).

TI  == prevotella micans sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == four strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human mouth were characterized using a variety of phenotypic and genotypic tests. the strains were found to comprise a homogeneous group and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed them to be distinct from but related to a loose cluster of prevotella species including prevotella buccalis, prevotella nanceiensis and prevotella marshii. a novel species, prevotella micans sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate  these strains. prevotella micans is saccharolytic and produces acetic, isovaleric and succinic acids and minor amounts of isobutyric acid as end products of fermentation. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 46 mol%. the type  strain of prevotella micans is e7.56(t) (=dsm 21469(t )=ccug 56105(t)).

TI  == prevotella marshii sp. nov. and prevotella baroniae sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == eleven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests  and were found to comprise two homogeneous groups, designated e2 and e4. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that members of both groups belonged to the genus prevotella but were distinct from any species with validly published names. this  distinction was confirmed by dna-dna hybridization and phenotypic tests. two novel species are therefore proposed: prevotella marshii sp. nov. (group e2) and  prevotella baroniae (group e4). both species are saccharolytic; the end-products  of fermentation for p. marshii are acetic, propionic and succinic acids, while p. baroniae produces acetic and succinic acids with minor amounts of isovaleric and  isobutyric acids. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain of prevotella marshii is 51 mol% and that of prevotella baroniae is 52 mol%. the type strain for p. marshii is e9.34(t) (=dsm 16973(t)=ccug 50419(t)) and that for p. baroniae is e9.33(t) (=dsm 16972(t)=ccug 50418(t)).
