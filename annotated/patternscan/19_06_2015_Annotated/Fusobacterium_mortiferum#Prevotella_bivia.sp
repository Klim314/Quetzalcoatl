TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
AB  == chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 gram-positive or gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 bacteroides fragilis group, 36 prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. mic50/mic90 values (mg/l) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. synergy (fic indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. all other combinations were additive (fic indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (fic indices >4.0) was seen. in addition,  synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 gram-positive or gram-negative strains. results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/ml at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the mic and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the mic in one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium varium, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and clostridium bifermentans. synergy between trovafloxacin (</=mic) and metronidazole alone was  seen in one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium mortiferum, p. asaccharolyticus and c. bifermentans. in many cases  of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin mic, regrowth after 48 h, which  was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was  observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
