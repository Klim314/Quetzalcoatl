2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.
cytotoxic, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of extracts of the bark of melia azedarach (china berry).
nature provides a variety of drugs and medicinal agents derived from plants. this study was conducted to determine antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of extracts of melia azedarach bark with methanol/water (9:1 v/v), chloroform, butanol, hexane, water and ethyl acetate. for the determination of the antimicrobial activities, the agar well diffusion method was employed. cytotoxicity was studied by brine shrimp lethality assay; antioxidant activities were measured using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. the chloroform extract was active against enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis, the ethyl acetate extract had highest antibacterial spectrum against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the n-hexane extract had highest inhibition against e. aerogenes, the aqueous extract showed highest activities against p. mirabilis, the butanol fraction showed highest activities against e. aerogenes and the methanolic extract was highly active against p. mirabilis.
antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of moringa oleifera lam.
4-(alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-o-acetyl-alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum, and epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all gram-positive bacteria tested (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi e. floccosum and t. rubrum. statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (iz) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against s. aureus, good to moderate activity against s. epidermidis, moderate activity against b. subtilis, and weak activity against e. floccosum and t. rubrum. the in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by mbc:mic ratios of 2:1.
antibacterial activity of some indian ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
in ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. herbal preparations such as triphala churna, hareetaki churna, dashmula churna, manjistadi churna, sukhsarak churna, ajmodadi churna, shivkshar pachan churna, mahasudarshan churna, swadist virechan churna and pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella typhimurium and proteus vulgaris, respectively. in the present study, triphala churna, hareetaki churna, dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against s. epidermidis, p. vulgaris, s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa and s. typhi. the study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
comparative evaluation of chromogenic agar cm1046 and mfc agar for detection of e. coli and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from water samples.
aims: the equivalence of oxoid (cm 1046) brilliance((tm)) e. coli/coliform selective agar to mfc agar, as used in the australian/new zealand standard method to detect thermotolerant coliforms and escherichia coli in water samples, was assessed. methods and results: a total of 244 water samples were analysed in parallel over a 5-month period. sewage effluent samples (n = 131, sites = 43), freshwater (n = 62, sites = 18) and marine/brackish water samples (n = 51, sites = 23) were analysed. the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test showed a varying degree of statistical difference between the two methods. all matrices had a higher recovery in the trial method. enterococci faecalis, aeromonas spp. and vibrio spp. did not grow on the cm1046 agar, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes were inhibited. conclusions: the use of cm 1046 for the detection and enumeration of e. coli and thermotolerant coliforms in water samples is a suitable alternative to the as/nzs standard method. significance and impact of the study: the use of cm1046 agar was less labour intensive and time consuming, as no secondary confirmation steps were required. confirmed results could be reported within 24 h of sample analysis, as compared to 48 h with the reference method. public health concerns can be addressed in a more efficient manner.
gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from salvia rosifolia sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (hd), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (mwhd), microdistillation (md) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (msd-spme), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of salvia rosifolia sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. hd and mwhd techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified as major constituents of this turkish endemic species. besides, the hydrodistilled oil of s. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. the hydrodistilled oil of s. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) with a mic value of 125microg/ml. other human pathogenic microorganisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans) were also inhibited within a moderate range (mic=125-1000microg/ml). antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing fungal plant pathogens colletotrichum acutatum, c. fragariae and c. gloeosporioides. no cytotoxicity was observed for s. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/ml against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.
copper uptake by pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from infected burn patients.
pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from infected burn patients and characterized by standard biochemical tests. the in vitro copper uptake was compared between this isolated pathogenic strain and two non-pathogenic control strains of gram positive bacteria bacillus thuringiensis strain israelis as well as gram negative bacteria enterobacter aerogenes. maximum copper uptake of 470 ppm/g biomass was obtained by p. aeruginosa strain, while the control strains b. thuringiensis and enterobacter aerogenes had copper uptake of 350 and 383 ppm/g biomass, respectively. however, the lowest copper uptake (60 ppm/g biomass) was observed with another control the saprophytic strain pseudomonas (shewanella) putrefaciens. a further investigation regarding the effect of copper toxicity on bacterial growth, gave an mic score of 600 ppm for p. aeruginosa strain compared to 460 and 300 ppm for the two gram positive and gram negative control strains, respectively. in tandem with these in vitro findings, blood analysis on burn patients infected with p. aeruginosa has indicated a selective decrease of copper (hypocupremia) and ceruloplasmin plasma levels. the iron metabolism was also affected by this copper deprivation leading to a similar decrease in plasma levels of pcv, iron, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin. all these hematological changes were significantly different (p < 0.05) from the matched group of non-infected burn patients. the observed hypocupremia in infected burn patients was attributed to demanding scavenger ability by p. aeruginosa strain for the copper of plasma.
microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
a series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3h-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. all the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans. of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities than that of norfloxacin against the bacterial strains s. aureus and s. faecalis except 13f against s. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of norfloxacin. against the fungal strains a. flavus and a. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of griseoflavin-16 except 13h against a. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of griseoflavin-16. the remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.
antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
antidiarrhoeal activity of the methanol extract of the barks of xylocarpus moluccensis in castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice.
the methanol (meoh) extract of the barks of xylocarpus moluccensis, and different fractions of this extract were studied for antidiarrhoeal activity using castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrhoea models in mice. at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, the meoh extract showed significant antidiarrhoeal activity in both models. the etoac fraction (eaf) and the residual meoh fraction (rmf) exhibited similar activity using a dose of 250 mg/kg in both models. no antidiarrhoeal activity was observed with the chloroform fraction (chf) at the test doses. when tested for antibacterial effect, the meoh extract displayed moderate inhibitory activity against escherichia coli, vibrio cholera, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, shigella dysentery, staphylococcus pyogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. while the chf inhibited the growth of escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermis, staphylococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the eaf was active against all test organisms except vibrio cholera and staphylococcus epidermis. the rmf inhibited the growth of all the test organisms with moderate zone of inhibition. on the basis of these findings, it can be assumed that xylocarpus moluccensis could be a potential source for novel 'lead' discovery for antidiarrhoeal drug development.
comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only 1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.
comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.
[sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.
antimicrobial activities of several parts of pinus brutia, juniperus oxycedrus, abies cilicia, cedrus libani and pinus nigra.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the kahramanmaras region of turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of pinus brutia ten., juniperus oxycedrus l., abies cilicia ant. & kotschy carr., cedrus libani a. rich. and pinus nigra arn. were prepared and tested against bacillus megaterium dsm 32, bacillus subtilis img 22, bacillus cereus fmc 19, escherichia coli dm, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 3, enterobacter aerogenes ccm 2531, staphylococcus aureus cowan 1, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, proteus vulgaris fmc 1, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, pseudomonas aeruginosa dsm 5007, candida albicans ccm 314, candida tropicalis mdc 86 and penicillium italicum k. the results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, e. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of a. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. all the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. when the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. on the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
[a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
the effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine n-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
the possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (ca), chlorogenic acid (cga) and ferulic acid (fa) on arylamine n-acetyltransferase (nat) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter koseri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. the bacterial nat activities were determined by hplc measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-af). among all examined bacteria, p. aeruginosa exerted the highest nat activity while c. koseri possessed the lowest nat activity. ca, cga and fa could suppress the bacterial nat activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. according to the analysis of kinetic parameters in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, ca, cga and fa were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial nat activities. for the time course experiment, 4 mm of ca and fa could inhibit bacterial nat activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mm of cga could only significantly suppress nat activity in e. coli for the same reaction time. these results strongly demonstrated that ca, cga and fa inhibited nat activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.
comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
in vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. the results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. imipenem (ipm) showed potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae. 2. ipm had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated enterobacteriaceae, that is, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus spp. 3. ipm showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus but not against xanthomonas maltophilia.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.
[susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2), p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
bacterial antagonists of shigellae.
bacterial antagonism between a microorganisms and shigella sonnei strains was studied in model experiments simulating conditions of the natural aquatic environment. in these studies surface waste samples from the river vltava served as the experimental environment. to ensure bacteriologically defined conditions all water samples were heat-sterilized prior to antagonism testing. consistently with the literature data and author's own observations the following bacterial species and genera were chosen as test organisms to be tested for antagonism against shigella sonnei strains in water; e. coli, citrobacter, enterobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fecal streptococci s. fecalis and s. faecium. presence or absence of microbial antagonism against shigellae was determined in the experimental water medium contaminated with shigella-test organism mixtures of density ratios within the range 1 : 1 through 1 : 10(4). the highest degree of antagonism was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa that at density ratio 1 : 1 inhibited the shigella sonnei growth in water within 42 hours of incubation. a similar degree of antagonism was also observed with klebsiella pneumoniae at the density ratio 1 : 10(1) and with enterobacter aerogenes at 1 : 10(2). at lower density ratios the antagonism exhibited by these two species was also present, but occurred much later, i.e. after 72 hours up to 5 days. the remaining test organisms used showed no antagonistic action shigella sonnei strain in the model aquatic environment.
growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k. aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. a comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of aztreoman (sq 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam inhibited 90% of citrobacter diversus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris and salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. this activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and shigella species. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. there was no major difference between mbc and mic values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon mic values was observed at 10(7) cfu.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. iii. synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
antimicrobial activity of heparin.
single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
competition of beta-lactam antibiotics for the penicillin-binding proteins of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli: comparison with antibacterial activity and effects upon bacterial morphology.
the competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli has been studied. the results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, pbp patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in e. coli k-12. comparison of the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various pbps of the five strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in p. aeruginosa.
[the role of enteric bacteria in childhood urinary tract infections and their in  vitro response to antimicrobial agents].
in this study, 154 cases of suspected bacterial urinary tract infection were examined bacteriologically. urine cultures yielded, e. coli in 84 patients citrobacter in 22 (c. freundii: 9, c. diversus: 9) proteus in 21 (p. vulgaris: 6, p. morgani: 4, p. rettgeri: 2. p. mirabilis: 4, lactose fermenting strains: 5), pseudomonas in 12 (p. aeruginosa: 5, other strains of pseudomonas: 7), klebsiella in 9 (k. aerogenes: 3, k. pneumonia: 6) and enterobacter in 6 patients (e. aerogenes: 1, e. cloacae: 5). in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that gentamicin, nalidixic acid, bactrim and gantrisin were the most effective antibacterial agents respectively. multiple resistances was found in 39 strains of e. coli out of 84. in other species multiple resistance was found in varying degrees. it is concluded that. every measure should be taken to eradicate the causative organisms in the urinary tract in children.
the effects of temperature and growth rate on the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in bacterial lipids.
the effects of temperature and growth rate on the fatty acid composition of the extractable lipids of four mesophilic and three psychotrophic bacteria were examined. two of the mesophiles (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their lipids with decreasing temperature over their whole growth temperature range. the other mesophiles (enterobacter aerogenes and lactobacillus casei) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids with decreasing temperature only over the lower half of their growth temperature ranges. the psychrotrophs pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter sp. had a constant proportion of unsaturated acids over the lower half of their growth temperature range, while the psychotrophic lactobacillus sp. showed no consistent change in its unsaturated fatty acid composition with temperature. all species showed some variation of unsaturated fatty acid composition with growth rate at the highest and lowest growth temperatures, although such variations were small in some species (ent. aerogenes and lactobacillus sp.).
clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
