TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and eperezolid, two novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid (formerly U-100766) and eperezolid (formerly U-100592) are novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents that are active against multi-drug-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, corynebacteria, and mycobacteria. Preliminary studies also demonstrated that the compounds inhibited some test strains of anaerobic bacteria. Therefore, we extended the in vitro evaluation of these agents to include a total of 54 different anaerobic species. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined using a standard agar dilution method for 143 anaerobic bacterial isolates. Eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated potent activity against the anaerobic Gram-positive organisms with most MIC values in the range of 0.25-4 microg/mL. Viridans streptococci demonstrated MICs of 1-2 microg/mL; Peptostreptococcus species and Propionibacterium species were inhibited by </=0.25-1 microg/mL. Clostridial species were generally susceptible to the oxazolidinones (MICs of </=0.25-8 microg/mL); however, seven strains of Clostridium difficile with linezolid MICs of 16 microg/mL or greater were detected. Against the anaerobic Gram-negative organisms, linezolid was more potent than eperezolid, especially for Bacteroides species. Linezolid inhibited most bacteroides in the range of 2-8 microg/mL, while eperezolid was generally two- to eight-fold less active. Linezolid and eperezolid both demonstrated potent activity against Fusobacterium species,Mobiluncus species,Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (MICs of </=0.25-0.5 microg/mL). Overall, the oxazolidinones demonstrated a significant level of activity against a number of clinically-important anaerobic bacterial species. Linezolid may potentially provide a broader spectrum of anaerobic coverage than eperezolid due to its greater activity against Bacteroides species.
TI  - The in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: Bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), Bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), Bacteroides vulgatus (5 strains), Bacteroides spp. (15 strains), Prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), Mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), Peptococcus niger (3 strains), Peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), Peptococcus spp (30 strains), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and Propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in Wilkins-Chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in an atmosphere of 10% H2, 10% CO2, 80% N2. All the drugs tested exert their activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic isolates. In particular, trospectomycin is quite active against Gram-positive cocci (MIC 90 = 4 - 8 mg/l), Gram-negative rods (MIC 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), Gram-positive rods (MIC 90 = 4 mg/l) and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC 90 = 0.5 mg/l).
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - In vitro activity of MDL 62,879 (GE2270 A) against aerobic gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MDL 62,879, a new peptide antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis through an interaction with elongation factor Tu, against a wide range of recent clinical isolates of common aerobic gram-positive and anaerobic organisms was determined. MDL 62,879 was highly active against staphylococci (MIC for 90% of isolates [MIC90], 0.125 microgram/ml), streptococci (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), and enterococci (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml). All isolates of peptostreptococci and Mobiluncus spp. were susceptible, as were most isolates of clostridia. MDL 62,879 was not active against isolates of fusobacteria or Bacteroides spp., but some isolates of Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica were susceptible.
