TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  == probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of lactobacillus salivarius ren (ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (dmh). the results indicated that oral administration of ren could effectively suppress dmh-induced colonic carcinogenesis. a significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 cfu/kg bodyweight per day. using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with dmh significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while ren counteracted these dmh-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by dmh and ren. injection of dmh significantly increased the amount of ruminococcus species (sp.) and clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the prevotella sp. administration of ren reduced the amount of ruminococcus sp., clostridiales bacteria, and bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of prevotella. real-time pcr results  were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. these findings suggested that ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. in conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  == construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in escherichia coli and its application in allitol production.
AB  == an engineered strain for the conversion of d-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in escherichia coli. d-psicose-3-epimerase from ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. the cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from candida methylica for continuous nadh supply. the recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mm d-fructose. to increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate,  the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. the results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system; the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mm d-fructose was used as the substrate.

TI  == murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  == three strains of an anaerobic, gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. these strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16s rrna gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family lachnospiraceae (<94 %). the most closely related species with names that  have standing in nomenclature were robinsoniella peoriensis, ruminococcus gnavus, blautia producta and clostridium xylanolyticum. phylogenetic relationships based  on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60  genes. the use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for ruminococcus gnavus and b. producta. all three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by c16 : 0 methyl ester. differences in the proportions of c12 : 0 methyl ester, c14 : 0 methyl ester and  c18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically  neighbouring species. the major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain srb-530-5-h(t) was acetic acid. this strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species robinsoniella peoriensis. the isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains srb-530-5-h(t) ( = dsm 26524(t) = ccug 63391(t)) (the type strain of murimonas intestini), srb-509-4-s-h ( = dsm 27577 = ccug 64595) and srb-524-4-s-h ( = dsm 27578 = ccug 64594).

TI  == co-expression of d-glucose isomerase and d-psicose 3-epimerase: development of an efficient one-step production of d-psicose.
AB  == d-psicose has been attracting attention in recent years because of its alimentary activities and is used as an ingredient in a range of foods and dietary supplements. to develop a one-step enzymatic process of d-psicose production, thermoactive d-glucose isomerase and the d-psicose 3-epimerase obtained from bacillus sp. and ruminococcus sp., respectively, were successfully co-expressed in escherichia coli bl21 strain. the substrate of one-step enzymatic process was  d-glucose. the co-expression system exhibited maximum activity at 65 degrees c and ph 7.0. mg(2+) could enhance the output of d-psicose by 2.32 fold to 1.6 g/l  from 10 g/l of d-glucose. when using high-fructose corn syrup (hfcs) as substrate, 135 g/l d-psicose was produced under optimum conditions. the mass ratio of d-glucose, d-fructose, and d-psicose was almost 3.0:2.7:1.0, when the reaction reached equilibrium after an 8h incubation time. this co-expression system approaching to produce d-psicose has potential application in food and beverage products, especially softdrinks.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  == background: presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (uc), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of uc. methods: the fecal microbiota of 30 uc samples obtained from 15 patients who  were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. results: the fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with uc and the control subjects (p = 0.0004). uc-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with uc. significant reduction of bacterial diversity  of members of the clostridium cluster iv and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including ruminococcus bromii et rel. eubacterium rectale et rel., roseburia sp., and akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in uc. increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including fusobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp., helicobacter sp., and campylobacter sp. as well as clostridium difficile were found to be associated with uc. conclusions: dysbiosis in uc is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. the microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota (im) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. however, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. this  study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (n), naringin (nr), hesperetin (h), hesperidin (hr), quercetin (q), rutin (qr), and catechin (cat) on the growth of human im representatives (bacteroides galacturonicus, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus caccae, bifidobacterium catenulatum, ruminococcus gauvreauii, escherichia coli). polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the im was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. cat had no impact on the tested im. q had  the strongest impact on r. gauvreauii, b. galacturonicus and lactobacillus sp. (mic 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. nr and hr had no  impact, but their aglycones n and h inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (mic >/=250 mug/ml). we conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. this means that polyphenols probably can modulate the im and indirectly interfere with their own  bioavailability.

TI  == overexpression of d-psicose 3-epimerase from ruminococcus sp. in escherichia coli and its potential application in d-psicose production.
AB  == the d-psicose 3-epimerase (dpe) gene from ruminococcus sp. was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein was purified and characterized. it was optimally active at ph 7.5-8.0 and 60 degrees c. activity was not dependent on the presence of metal ions; however, it became more thermostable with added mn(2+). the k (m) of the enzyme for d-psicose (48 mm) was lower than that for d-tagatose (230 mm), suggesting that d-psicose is the optimum substrate. more importantly, the thermostability of the novel dpe from ruminococcus is the strongest among all of the d-psicose and d-tagatose 3-epimerases and may be suitable for the industrial production of d-psicose from  fructose.

TI  == acetatifactor muris gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the intestine of an obese mouse.
AB  == we used selective agar media for culturing bacteria from the caecum of mice fed a high calorie diet. in addition to the isolation of enterobacteriaceae growing on  a medium containing cholesterol and bile salts, we focused on the characterization of strain ct-m2(t), which, based on 16s rdna analysis, did not appear to correspond to any currently described organisms. the isolate belongs to the clostridium cluster xiv and is most closely related to members of the lachnospiraceae, including the genera anaerostipes, blautia, butyrivibrio, clostridium, coprococcus, eubacterium, robinsoniella, roseburia, ruminococcus and syntrophococcus (</=90 % similarity). strain ct-m2(t) is a non-motile gram-positive rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 48.5 %. cells grow under strictly anoxic conditions (100 % n(2)) and produce acetate and butyrate after growth in reduced wca broth. in contrast to related species, the new bacterium does not metabolize glucose and is positive for phenylalanine arylamidase, and its major cellular fatty acid is c(1)(4):(0). based on phylogenetic and phenotypic studies, the isolate merits recognition as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the name acetatifactor muris is proposed. the type strain is ct-m2(t) (= dsm 23669(t) = atcc baa-2170(t)).

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == blautia faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == a strictly anoxic, gram-stain-positive, non-motile blautia-like bacterium, designated strain m25(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. strain m25(t)  was negative for both catalase and oxidase activity, utilized carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced lactate and acetate as the major end products of glucose fermentation in pyg medium, and had a dna g+c content of 41.6 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that strain m25(t) was closely related to ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (96.40 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and blautia glucerasea hfth-1(t) (96.17 %) within the family lachnospiraceae. straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated cellular fatty acids were also detected, the majority being c(14 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) dimethyl acetal acids. based on the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics presented in this study, strain m25(t) represents a novel species within the genus blautia for which the name blautia faecis sp. nov. is proposed.  the type strain is m25(t) ( = kctc 5980(t) = jcm 17205(t)).

TI  == molecular diversity of the foregut bacteria community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius).
AB  == the molecular diversity of the foregut bacterial community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius) in central australia was investigated through comparative analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences prepared from the foregut contents of 12 adult feral camels fed on native vegetation. a total of 267 full-length 16s rrna  gene clones were examined, with 151 operational taxonomic units (otus) identified at a 99% species-level identity cut-off criterion. the prediction of actual diversity in the foregut of the dromedary camel using the chaol approach was 238  otus, while the richness and evenness of the diversity estimated using shannon index was 4.84. the majority of bacteria in the current study were affiliated with the bacterial phylum firmicutes (67% of total clones) and were related to the classes clostridia, bacilli and mollicutes, followed by the bacteroidetes (25%) that were mostly represented by the family prevotellaceae. the remaining phyla were represented by actinobacteria, chloroflexi, cynophyta, lentisphaerae,  planctomycetes, proteobacteria and sphirochaetes. moreover, 11 clones of cultivated bacteria were identified as brevundimonas sp., butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella sp. and ruminococcus flavefaciens. the novelty in this foregut environment is remarkable where 97% of the otus were distantly related to any known sequence in the public database.

TI  == microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  == it is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. pyrosequencing targeting the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. the bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. clustering and venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. traditional fecal indicators, i.e., escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. besides the bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., parasutterella excrementihominis, veillonella sp., dialister invisus, megamonas funiformis, and ruminococcus lactaris for the human and lactobacillus amylovorus and atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. these microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent  on the absence or presence of a single indicator. monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.

TI  == ruminococcus faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == bacterial strain eg2(t), an anaerobic, gram-positive, non-motile, and non-spore-forming coccus, was isolated from human faeces. the optimal temperature for its growth was 37 degrees c. oxidase activity was negative, but catalase activity was positive. the strain was able to hydrolyze esculin and to produce acids from the fermentation of several substrates, including glucose. lactic and  acetic acids were the main products of glucose fermentation. the major fatty acids present in this strain were c(16:0), c(14:0), and c(18:1) cis11 dma. the g+c content was 43.4 mol%. based on the 16s rrna gene sequence, strain eg2(t) was closely related to species of the genus ruminococcus (96.3% similarity to r. torques and 96.2% similarity to r. lactaris), and its taxonomic position was placed within the clostridium cluster xiva. based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic,  genotypic, and phylogenetic evidence, we propose that this novel strain be assigned to the genus ruminococcus and be named ruminococcus faecis sp. nov. the  type strain is eg2(t) (=kctc 5757(t) =jcm 15917(t)).

TI  == isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (fae1a) from the rumen  fungus anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  == aims: a novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in escherichia coli and characterized. methods and results: a total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-na) were isolated from an a. mucronatus ye505 cdna library. sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. the gene, fae1a, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to ce family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as orpinomyces sp., ruminococcus albus and clostridium thermocellum. the gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. the coding sequence was cloned into the pet30a expression vector and overexpressed in e. coli bl21 (de3). gene product fae1a was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. conclusions: fae1a exhibited a lower k(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /k(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-na or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. it releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. activity of fae1a was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. significance and impact of the study: to our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of  anaeromyces.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == isolation of a novel bacterium, blautia glucerasei sp. nov., hydrolyzing plant glucosylceramide to ceramide.
AB  == a bacterial strain that is capable of hydrolyzing plant glucosylceramide (glucer) was newly isolated from dog feces. the novel strain, designated as strain hfth-1(t), hydrolyzed plant glucer with a variety of chemical structures, but did not hydrolyze glucosylsphingosine, lactosylceramide, or monosialoganglioside gm(3), indicating that strain hfth-1(t) produces glucer-specific glucosylceramidase. strain hfth-1(t) was gram-positive, anaerobic, oval-spore-forming, rod-shaped, lecithinase-negative, and lipase-negative. it fermented a wide variety of carbohydrates and produced mainly acetate, formate, and lactate from glucose. the g + c content of its dna was 40.7 mol%. the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequence revealed that strain hfth-1(t) is placed in the clostridial rrna cluster xiva, with ruminococcus obeum as the nearest relative. pairwise comparison revealed approximately 5.0% sequence divergence between strain hfth-1(t) and the type strain of r. obeum. on the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic divergence, it is proposed that the hitherto unknown rod-shaped bacterial strain hfth-1(t) (= dsm 22028(t) = nbrc 104932(t)) should be placed in the genus blautia as a novel species, blautia glucerasei sp. nov, the only currently known isolate of the species.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

AB  == the first colonisation of the intestine is one of the most profound immunological exposures faced by the newborn and it is influenced by external and internal factors. the early composition of human microbiota could have long-lasting metabolic effects and the initial composition of human intestinal bacteria is also known to affect postnatal immune system development, as we are already aware that reduced microbial stimulation during infancy would result in slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between th1 and th2-like immunity. mode of delivery has a major role on the composition of intestinal microbiota in early infancy, as it has been shown that  infants born by caesarean section (cs) have lower numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides compared with vaginally born infants. we designed a study to investigate the influence of mode of delivery (cs vs. vaginal delivery) on intestinal microbial composition on day 3 of life using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and pcr-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge). both dgge and tgge analyses have been used, together with the specific amplifications for 10 bifidobacterium sp., 3 ruminococcus sp., and bacteroides that all have a highly relevant physiological role in the intestinal ecosystem of the newborn. a total of 46 term infants were enrolled in the study, consecutively recruiting all the cs-delivered babies (n=23; 8 males and 15 females) and the immediately following spontaneously delivered babies (n=23; 11 males and 12 females). dgge analysis carried out with bifidobacterium-specific primers revealed the presence of this genus in 13 of 23 (56.5%) samples derived from vaginally delivered newborns but in none of the samples obtained from newborns delivered by cs. pcr analysis with bifidobacterium-species-specific primers showed that naturally delivered infants had a large number of bifidobacterial species, whereas in cs-delivered babies only two samples (8.7%) gave positive results, one for b. longum and another for b. gallicum. in all babies enrolled, micro-organisms belonging to ruminococcus species were absent and bacteroides was found in 8.7% of spontaneously delivered babies only. based on our findings, it seems that newborn's intestinal bacteria during the first 3days of life are strongly influenced by mode of delivery. the intestinal flora of cs and vaginally delivered infants appears to be very different; the former being altered and characterised by a substantial absence of bifidobacteria sp., the latter characterised by subject-specific microbial profiles, although predominant groups such as b. longum and b. catenulatum could be identified. in summary, mode of delivery does affect the early stage of intestinal bacterial colonisation, which  is altered in cs-delivered infants compared with vaginally delivered infants, with only a minor influence of the type of feeding. in addition, the importance of methodological aspects for determining intestinal microbiota in clinical trials requires emphasis if intestinal microbiota composition is to be considered a measure of postnatal adaptation.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == performance of a three-stage membrane bioprocess treating the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and evolution of its archaeal and bacterial ecology.
AB  == a novel three-stage bioprocess achieved 75% volatile solids (vs) removal at an organic loading rate (olr) of 4g vsl(-1)day, a solids retention time (srt) of 66days, a hydraulic retention time (hrt) of 20days, at a temperature of 35 degrees c. the bioprocess consisted of an anaerobic hydrolytic reactor (hr) where the solids and liquid fractions of the organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (ofmsw) were separated with a mesh. the leachate was pumped to a submerged  anaerobic membrane bioreactor (sambr) and the treated permeate was polished in an aerobic membrane bioreactor (ambr). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing analyses indicated that the increase in methane content in the hr caused by the excess sludge recycle from the sambr was associated with  an increase in the number of hydrogenotrophic species, mainly methanobrevibacter  sp., methanobacterium formicicum and methanosarcina sp. at 20 degrees c vs removal dropped to 50% in the hr and some dgge bands disappeared when compared to 35 degrees c samples, while some bands such as the one corresponding to ruminococcus flavefaciens were reduced in intensity. the species associated with  the cod-polishing properties of the ambr correspond to the genera pseudomonas, hyphomonas and hyphomicrobiaceae. these results highlight the positive effect of  recycling the excess sludge from the sambr to re-inoculate the hr with hydrogenotrophic species.

TI  == further studies on a human intestinal bacterium ruminococcus sp. end-1 for transformation of plant lignans to mammalian lignans.
AB  == a human intestinal bacterium ruminococcus (r.) sp. end-1 capable of oxidizing (-)-enterodiol to (-)-enterolactone, enantioselectively, was further investigated from the perspective of transformation of plant lignans to mammalian lignans; a cell-free extract of the bacterium transformed (-)-enterodiol to (-)-enterolactone through an intermediate, enterolactol. the bacterium showed not only oxidation but also demethylation and deglucosylation activities for plant lignans. arctiin and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were converted to (-)-dihydroxyenterolactone and (+)-dihydroxyenterodiol, respectively. moreover, by coincubation with eggerthella sp. sdg-2, the bacterium transformed arctiin and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside to (-)-enterolactone and (+)-enterodiol, respectively.

AB  == phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on 15 isolates of an unidentified gram-positive, anaerobic, non-sporulating coccobacillus-shaped bacterium isolated from human faeces. the novel organisms were catalase-negative, indole-negative and produced acetate and succinate as end products of metabolism. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated that the 15 isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown subline within the clostridial rrna cluster xiva. the novel isolates formed a robust phylogenetic group with a number of organisms which included clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus obeum and a number of other misclassified ruminococci. on the basis of these studies, a novel genus, blautia gen. nov., is  proposed. it is suggested that clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus hansenii, ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus productus, and ruminococcus schinkii are transferred to this genus as blautia coccoides gen. nov., comb. nov., blautia hansenii comb. nov., blautia hydrogenotrophica comb. nov., blautia luti comb. nov., blautia producta comb. nov. and blautia schinkii comb. nov. one of the new isolates, the hitherto unknown coccus-shaped bacterial  strain wal 14507t (=atcc baa-1564t=dsm 19850t) is proposed as representing the type strain of a novel species, blautia wexlerae sp. nov.

AB  == a novel strictly anaerobic, vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccus (strain ccri-16,110(t)) was isolated from a human faecal specimen. this strain was characterized using morphological, biochemical and molecular taxonomic methods. the organism was unable to hydrolyse aesculin and failed to produce acid from cellobiose, d-lactose and alpha-raffinose. acetic acid was the sole product of glucose fermentation by the organism. on the basis of 16s rrna and tuf gene sequence comparison, strain ccri-16,110(t) was most closely related to species of the genus ruminococcus and formed a hitherto unknown sublineage within the clostridium coccoides rrna cluster of organisms (cluster xiva). based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, a novel species, ruminococcus gauvreauii sp. nov., is proposed. the type strain is ccri-16,110(t) (=nml 060141(t) =ccug 54,292(t) =jcm 14987(t)).

TI  == clostridium saccharogumia sp. nov. and lactonifactor longoviformis gen. nov., sp. nov., two novel human faecal bacteria involved in the conversion of the dietary phytoestrogen secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == two anaerobic bacteria involved in the conversion of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were isolated from faeces of a healthy male adult. the first isolate, strain sdg-mt85-3db, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic gram-positive helically coiled rod. based on 16s r rna gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were clostridium cocleatum (96.7% similarity) and clostridium ramosum (96.6%). in contrast to these species, the isolate was devoid of alpha-galactosidase and -glucosidase and did not grow on maltose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and trehalose. the hypothesis that strain sdg-mt85-3db represents a new bacterial species of the clostridium cluster xviii was confirmed by dna-dna hybridisation experiments. the g+c content of dna of strain sdg-mt85-3db (30.7+/-0.8 mol%) was comparable with that of clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus clostridium. the name clostridium saccharogumia is  proposed for strain sdg-mt85-3db (=dsm 17460t=ccug 51486t). the second isolate, strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic gram-positive regular  rod. based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were clostridium amygdalinum (93.3%), clostridium saccharolyticum (93.1%) and ruminococcus productus (93.0%). the isolate differed from these species in its ability to dehydrogenate enterodiol. it also possessed alpha-arabinosidase and -galactosidase and had a higher g+c content of dna (48.0 mol%). according to these findings, it is proposed to create a novel genus, lactonifactor, and a novel species, lactonifactor longoviformis, to accommodate strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6. the type strain is dsm 17459t (=ccug 51487t).

TI  == molecular analyses of the intestinal microbiota of chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity.
AB  == little information is available regarding the intestinal bacteria of chimpanzees  in the wild, due to the technical difficulties of studying intestinal bacteria in the field. in this study, molecular-based bacterial analyses were performed to overcome this difficulty because polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based methods, such as temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), of the bacterial 16s rrna gene can be applied to ethanol-fixed fecal samples. the common presence of bacteria belonging to the  clostridium rrna sub-group xiva, such as ruminococcus obeum and eubacterium sp.,  was indicated for bossou wild chimpanzees by ardra. tgge on partial 16s rdna followed by hierarchical clustering analysis showed a systematic difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota between wild and captive chimpanzees. however, several tgge bands commonly shared by wild and captured chimpanzees were excised, and their sequences were obtained. they were suggested to be the clostridium leptum subgroup bacteria, lactobacillus gasseri-like bacterium, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum- or b. catenulatum-like bacterium. these may be considered as common intestinal bacteria for chimpanzees, and may be transmitted  vertically over generations.

TI  == a longitudinal study of infant faecal microbiota during weaning.
AB  == for infants, the introduction of food other than breast milk is a high risk period due to diarrheal diseases, and may be corroborated with a shift in the faecal microbiota. this longitudinal study was the first undertaken to understand the effect of the supplementation on the infant's faecal microbiota and particularly the bifidobacteria. eleven infants were enrolled. their faecal microbiota were analysed using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis  (ttge) with bacterial and bifidobacterial primers. in parallel, bifidobacterial counts were followed using competitive pcr. three periods were distinguished: exclusive breastfeeding (bf period), weaning (i.e. formula-milk addition, w period) and postweaning (i.e. breastfeeding cessation, pw period). the bifidobacterial counts were not modified, reaching 10.5 (log10 cells g(-1) wet weight). in the ttge profiles, the main identified bands corresponded to escherichia coli, ruminococcus sp. and bifidobacterium sp., more precisely bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium breve. for both ttge profiles, the analysis of the distance suggested a maturation of the faecal microbiota but no correlation could be established with the diet. despite  a high interindividual variability, composition of the faecal microbiota appeared more homogenous after weaning and this point may be correlated with the cessation of breastfeeding.

TI  == the dynamics of major fibrolytic microbes and enzyme activity in the rumen in response to short- and long-term feeding of sapindus rarak saponins.
AB  == aims: to investigate the short- and long-term effects of an extract of sapindus rarak saponins (se) on the rumen fibrolytic enzyme activity and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms. methods and results: two feeding trials were conducted. in the short-term trial, four fistulated goats were fed a basal diet containing sugar cane tops and wheat pollard (65:35, w/w) and were supplemented for 7 days with se at a level of 0.6 g kg(-1) body weight. rumen liquor was taken before, during and after se feeding. in the long-term trial, 28 sheep were fed the same basal diet as the goats and were supplemented for 105 days with 0.24, 0.48 and 0.72 g kg(-1) body mass of the extract. rumen liquor was taken on days 98 and 100. protozoal numbers were counted under the microscope. cell wall degradation was determined by enzyme assays and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms were quantified by dot blot hybridization. sapindus extract significantly depressed rumen xylanase activity in both trials and carboxymethylcellulase activity in the long-term trial (p < 0.01). fibrobacter sp. were not affected by the se in both trials, while ruminococci and the anaerobic fungi showed a short-term response to the application of saponins. protozoal counts were decreased only in the long-term trial with sheep. conclusion: these data suggest that there is an adaptation of ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens and chytridiomycetes (fungi) to saponin when fed over a long period. the fact that no correlation between the cell wall degrading enzyme  activities and the cell wall degrading micro-organisms was observed suggests that the organisms tracked in this experiment are not the only key players in ruminal  cell wall degradation. significance and impact of the study: sapindus rarak saponins partially defaunate the rumen flora. their negative effect on cell wall  degradation, however, is not related to rumen organisms currently recognized as the major cell wall degrading species. the adaptation of microbes in the long-term feeding experiment suggests that the results from short-term trial on the ruminal microbial community have to be interpreted carefully.

TI  == naturally occurring dna transfer system associated with membrane vesicles in cellulolytic ruminococcus spp. of ruminal origin.
AB  == a genetic transformation system with similarities to those reported for gram-negative bacteria was found to be associated with membrane vesicles of the ruminal cellulolytic genus ruminococcus. double-stranded dna was recovered from the subcellular particulate fraction of all the cellulolytic ruminococci examined. electron microscopy revealed that the only particles present resembled  membrane vesicles. the likelihood that the dna was associated with membrane vesicles (also known to contain cellulosomes) was further supported by the adherence of the particles associated with the subcellular dna to cellulose powder added to culture filtrates. the particle-associated dna comprised a population of linear molecules ranging in size from <20 kb to 49 kb (ruminococcus sp. strain ye73) and from 23 kb to 90 kb (ruminococcus albus ar67). particle-associated dna from r. albus ar67 represented dna derived from genomic dna of the host bacterium having an almost identical hindiii digestion pattern and an identical 16s rrna gene. paradoxically, particle-associated dna was refractory to digestion with ecori, while the genomic dna was susceptible to extensive digestion, suggesting that there is differential restriction modification of genomic dna and dna exported from the cell. transformation using  the vesicle-containing fraction of culture supernatant of ruminococcus sp. strain ye71 was able to restore the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose to two mutants that were otherwise unable to do so. the ability was heritable and transferred to subsequent generations. it appears that membrane-associated transformation plays a role in lateral gene transfer in complex microbial ecosystems, such as the rumen.

AB  == its metabolic characteristics suggest zymobacter palmae gen. nov., sp. nov. could serve as a useful new ethanol-fermenting bacterium, but its biotechnological exploitation would require certain genetic improvements. we therefore established a method for transforming z. palmae using the broad-host vector plasmids prk290,  pmfy31 and pmfy40 as a source of transforming dna. using electroporation, the frequency of transformation was 10(5) to 10(6) transformants/mug of dna. to confer the ability to ferment cellobiose, which is a hydrolysis product from cellulosic materials treated enzymatically or with acid, the beta-glucosidase gene from ruminococcus albus was introduced into z. palmae, where its expression  was driven by its endogenous promoter. about 56% of the enzyme expressed was localized on the cell-surface or in the periplasm. the recombinant z. palmae could ferment 2% cellobiose to ethanol, producing 95% of the theoretical yield with no accumulation of organic acids as metabolic by-products. thus, expression  of beta-glucosidase in z. palmae expanded the substrate spectrum of the strain, enabling ethanol production from cellulosic materials.

TI  == culture-dependent and -independent methods to investigate the microbial ecology of italian fermented sausages.
AB  == in this study, the microbial ecology of three naturally fermented sausages produced in northeast italy was studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods. by plating analysis, the predominance of lactic acid bacteria populations was pointed out, as well as the importance of coagulase-negative cocci. also in the case of one fermentation, the fecal enterocci reached significant counts, highlighting their contribution to the particular transformation process. yeast counts were higher than the detection limit (> 100  cfu/g) in only one fermented sausage. analysis of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) patterns and sequencing of the bands allowed profiling of  the microbial populations present in the sausages during fermentation. the bacterial ecology was mainly characterized by the stable presence of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus sakei, but lactobacillus paracasei was also repeatedly detected. an important piece of evidence was the presence of lactococcus garvieae, which clearly contributed in two fermentations. several species of staphylococcus were also detected. regarding other bacterial groups, bacillus sp., ruminococcus sp., and macrococcus caseolyticus were also identified at the beginning of the transformations. in addition, yeast species belonging to  debaryomyces hansenii, several candida species, and willopsis saturnus were observed in the dgge gels. finally, cluster analysis of the bacterial and yeast dgge profiles highlighted the uniqueness of the fermentation processes studied.

AB  == ruminococcal cellulase (ruminococcus albus f-40 endoglucanase egi) was successfully expressed in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ob156c, using the erm promoter from pambeta1. a newly identified signal peptide coding region of xyna from b. fibrisolvens 49 allowed efficient translocation of the foreign egi into the extracellular fraction. first, b. fibrisolvens xyna with or without its own putative signal peptide (xyna sp) coding region was cloned into a shuttle vector  to transform b. fibrisolvens ob156c. both plasmids caused a 2- to 2.4-fold increase in xylanase activity. the transformant expressing xyna with the signal peptide showed a significantly higher proportion of activity in the extracellular fraction than the transformant with xyna lacking the signal peptide (75% vs. 19%), demonstrating the significance of xyna sp in the translocation of the expressed enzyme. second, using the xyna sp coding region, secretion of egi was attempted in b. fibrisolvens. since the signal peptide of r. albus egi did not function in b. fibrisolvens, it was replaced with the xyna sp. a high activity variant of egi containing the xyna sp was transcribed using the erm promoter, resulting in a 27-fold increase in endoglucanase activity, most of which (>93%) was in the extracellular fraction of the b. fibrisolvens transformant. egi without the xyna sp was scarcely detected in the extracellular fraction (<10%).

AB  == abstract in humans, plant cell wall polysaccharides (mainly cellulose and hemicelluloses) represent an important source of dietary fibres that are digested by the gut microflora. however, the fibrolytic micro-organisms involved in the breakdown of these substrates remain largely unknown. our objective was to quantify the microcrystalline-cellulose-degrading and methanogenic microbial communities in faecal samples (n=34) from both methane- and non-methane-excreting individuals and to identify the predominant cellulolytic organisms in these two categories of subjects. microcrystalline cellulose degraders could only be enumerated in faecal samples from methane excretors while this community remained undetectable in non-methane-excretors. the cellulolytic isolates corresponded to  new ruminococcus species and to enterococcus sp. closely related to enterococcus  faecalis. the presence of such fibrolytic species seems to be linked to that of methanogenic archaea in the gut, the relationships between these two microbial communities needing further investigation. our findings suggest that the structure and activity of the cellulolytic communities differ in methane- and non-methane-excreting individuals.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == ruminococcus luti sp. nov., isolated from a human faecal sample.
AB  == a strain of an unidentified strictly anoxic, gram-postive, non-motile ruminococcus-like bacterium was isolated from a human faecal sample. the organism used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced acetate, succinate, and hydrogen as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a g + c content of 43.3 mol%. the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the organism were consistent with its assignment to the genus ruminococcus but it did not correspond to any recognized species of this genus. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed the unidentified bacterium represents a previously unrecognised sub-line within the clostridium coccoides rrna group of organisms. the nearest relative of the unknown bacterium corresponded to ruminococcus obeum but a 16s rrna sequence divergence value of >3% demonstrated it represents a different species. based on the presented findings a new species, ruminococcus luti, is described. the type strain of ruminococcus luti is binix(t) (dsm 14534t, ccug 45635t).

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of paenibacillus sp. ts12.
AB  == we report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [ec 3.2.1.45] from paenibacillus sp. ts12. the open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. the enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with gh family 3 beta-glucosidases from clostridium thermocellum, ruminococcus albus, and aspergillus aculeateus. the recombinant enzyme, expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3)plyss, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kda and hydrolyzed nbd-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, gm1a or sphingomyelin. the enzyme was most active at ph 6.5, and its apparent km  and vmax values for nbd-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microm and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microm and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. site-directed mutagenesis indicated that asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in gh family 3 beta-glucosidases. this is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.

AB  == analyses of 165 rrna gene sequences, restriction endonuclease digestion fingerprints of 16s-23s intergenic regions, dna base compositions, fatty-acid profiles, cell-wall chemistry, cell physiology and fermentation end-product composition, along with other biochemical and phenotypic properties, supported the view that trichococcus flocculiformis echtt (dsm 2094t), lactosphaera pasteurii kota2t (dsm 2381t), ruminococcus palustris z-7189t (dsm 9172t) and an isolate named 'carnococcus allantoicus' ndp were all very similar and should be merged into a single genus. detailed characterization of strains ben 77, ben 200  and ben 201 described previously as 'nostocoida limicola' i, a filamentous bacterium which causes bulking in activated sludge systems, revealed that these strains also belonged to the same genus as t. flocculiformis echtt, l. pasteurii  kota2t, r. palustris z-7189t and 'c allantoicus' ndp. in fact, their shared properties suggested that these strains all belonged to a single species. however, dna-dna hybridization data indicated that t. flocculiformis echtt, all of the 'n. limicola' i isolates and 'c allantoicus' ndp belonged to the same species, whereas l. pasteurii kota2t, r. palustris z-7189t and two new isolates,  37an3*t and 45an2, represented three distinct species within the same genus. the  priority of the genus name trichococcus is established and since its validation predates the description of the genus lactosphaera this name should take precedence. under certain culture conditions, all of the strains mentioned above  could produce chains of cocci. furthermore, the morphology of t. flocculiformis echtt could change to a non-filamentous form on certain media. this study proposes that the above strains be reclassified as members of the genus trichococcus as four species, namely trichococcus flocculiformis emend. (type strain echtt = dsm 2094t), trichococcus pasteurii comb. nov. (type strain kota2t  = dsm 2381t = atcc 35945t), trichococcus collinsii sp. nov. (type strain 37an3*t  = dsm 14526t = atcc baa-296t, and trichococcus palustris comb. nov. (type strain  z-7189t = dsm 9172t).

TI  == effects of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid on the growth, glycyrrhizin beta-d-glucuronidase and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of human intestinal  bacteria.
AB  == the peak of glycyrrhizin (gl) beta-d-glucuronidase activity for ruminococcus sp.  po1-3 and eubacterium sp. glh changed to 24 h from 12 h of culture and to 12 h from 48 h, respectively, at almost the same level by the addition of 1.0 mm gl. this enzyme activity was about 20-fold higher in eubacterium sp. glh than in ruminococcus sp. po1-3. gl beta-d-glucuronidase activity of ruminococcus sp. po1-3 with eubacterium sp. glh and the intestinal flora showed a maximal peak at  12 h of culture in the presence and absence of 1.0 mm gl. this enzyme activity was about 2.5-fold higher in mixed bacteria than in intestinal flora. 3beta-hydrosteroid dehydrogenase activity of ruminococcus sp. po1-3 and ruminococcus sp. po1-3 with eubacterium sp. glh was suppressed greater in the presence of gl than without gl. also, ruminococcus sp. po1-3, eubacterium sp. glh, and a mixture of both and intestinal flora, metabolized 1.0 mm gl to glycyrrhetic acid (ga) in yields of about 10, 70, 40 and 100%, respectively, with 24 h culture. from the level of gl beta-d-glucuronidase activity, it is considered that the metabolism of gl by intestinal flora is due to both enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. moreover, ga at a concentration of 1.0 mm suppressed growth of ruminococcus sp. po1-3, eubacterium sp. glh, and the mixture of both and intestinal flora, which metabolized 1.0 mm ga to a negligible amount of 3-oxo-glycyrrhetic acid, indicating the accumulation of unchanged ga. gl beta-d-glucuronidase activity of intestinal flora was enhanced by ga, which stimulated bacteria possessing particular this characteristic.

AB  == eubacterium sp. glh with ruminococcus sp. po1-3 and clostridium innocuum es24-06  possessing enzymes involved in the metabolism of glycyrrhizin (gl) was cultured in gam medium with and without 1.0 mm gl or 1.0 mm glycyrrhetic acid (ga). gl (1.0 mm) enhanced 3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate (3alpha-hydroxyga) dehydrogenase  activity, ga (1.0 mm) suppressed 3alpha-hydroxyga dehydrogenase activity, gl beta-d-glucuronidase activity and the mixed bacterial growth, and gl and ga showed almost no change in a lower level of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-hsd) activity during 5 d of culture. gl (1.0 mm) and ga (1.0 mm) were metabolized to a small amount of ga and a negligible amount of 3-oxo-glycyrrhetic acid (3-oxo-ga) and 3alpha-hydroxyga, and to a negligible amount of 3-oxo-ga, respectively, by these mixed bacteria. these amounts coincided with those of metabolites produced from 1.0 mm gl and 1.0 mm ga added to these mixed bacteria after 24 h culture. whole bacteria and sonicated bacteria derived from the collection of these mixed bacteria reached a maximal stage and metabolized gl to  a relatively large amount of ga and 3-oxo-ga, and a negligible amount of 3alpha-hydroxyga and ga to a small amount of 3-oxo-ga and 3alpha-hydroxyga within 180 min. gl beta-d-glucuronidase with 3beta-hsd and 3alpha-hydroxyga dehydrogenase partially purified from each bacterium was converted gl to 3alpha-hydroxyga, producing metabolites of about 60% after 10 min of incubation.  these mixed bacteria possessed high enzyme activities could produce the metabolites of gl in under one hour under conditions.

TI  == influence of various bile acids on the metabolism of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid by ruminococcus sp. po1-3 of human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == ruminococcus sp. po1-3, an intestinal bacterium isolated from human feces, metabolized glycyrrhizin (gl) to glycyrrhetic acid (ga) and ga to 3-oxo-glycyrrhetic acid (3-oxo-ga) and possessed gl beta-d-glucuronidase and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-hsd) involved in the metabolism of gl.  this bacterial growth was enhanced by gl at a concentration of 0.4 mm and was suppressed by ga at concentration of 1.0 mm. chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid among the bile acids added to this bacterium suppressed the growth and gl beta-d-glucuronidase activity and 3beta-hsd activity incident to it at a concentration of 1.0 mm, while cholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid and glycine and taurin conjugates of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic  acid and lithocholic acid had almost no effect on this bacterium at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.0 mm. however, these enzyme activities of this sonicated bacteria were inhibited by all of these bile acids. although each bile  acid and gl added to bacteria at the same time suppressed the growth and the amount of metabolite ga by all bile acids used except cholic acid, taurocholic acid and taurodeoxycholic acid with gl, a combination of each bile acid and ga eased the growth inhibition caused by ga at a concentration of 0.2 mm and enhanced the amount of metabolite 3-oxo-ga by the glycine conjugate of bile acids with ga. gl or ga added after 6 h culture with each of these bile acids and bacteria was metabolized to a relatively large amount of ga by chenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid and their glycine and taurine conjugates, glycocholic acid and taurodeoxycholic acid, or had almost no effect on the amount of metabolite 3-oxo-ga, respectively. these results showed that although gl added after the exposure to bile acid and ga and bile acid added at the same time as bacteria had different bile acid action, these conditions enhanced the amount of  metabolite ga from gl and metabolite 3-oxo-ga from ga.

AB  == production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. anaerobic clostridia are  potential producers and immobilized c. butyricum produces 2 mol h2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. spontaneous production of h2 from formate and glucose by immobilized escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. enterobactericiae produces h2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). immobilized aerobic bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol h2/mol glucose. photosynthetic rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of h2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. excellent productivity (6.2 mol h2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (hup) mutant of r. capsulata on cellulose was found. cyanobacteria, viz., anabaena, synechococcus, and oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of h2. immobilized a. cylindrica produces h2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year.  increased h2 productivity was found for hup mutant of a. variabilis. synechococcus sp. has a high potential for h2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and h2 by klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. the fate of h2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.

TI  == three neocallimastix patriciarum esterases associated with the degradation of complex polysaccharides are members of a new family of hydrolases.
AB  == acetylesterase and cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activities were demonstrated in culture supernatant of the anaerobic ruminal fungus neocallimastix patriciarum. a cdna expression library from n. patriciarum was screened for esterases using beta-naphthyl acetate and a model cinnamoyl ester compound. cdna clones representing four different esterase genes (bnaa-d) were isolated. none of the enzymes had cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity, but two of the enzymes (bnaa and  bnac) had acetylxylan esterase activity, bnaa, bnab and bnac encode proteins with several distinct domains. carboxy-terminal repeats in bnaa and bnac are homologous to protein-docking domains in other enzymes from neocallimastix species and another anaerobic fungus, a piromyces sp. the catalytic domains of bnab and bnac are members of a recently described family of ser/his active site hydrolases [upton, c. & buckley, j.t. (1995). trends biochem sci 20, 178-179]. bnab exhibits 40% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the cele cellulase from clostridium thermocellum and bnac exhibits 52% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the xynb xylanase from ruminococcus flavefaciens. bnaa, whilst exhibiting less than 10% overall amino acid identity to bnab or bnac, or to any other known protein, appears to be a member of the same family of hydrolases, having the three universally conserved amino acid sequence motifs. several other previously described esterases are also shown to be members of this family, including a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase from aspergillus aculeatus. however, none of the other previously described enzymes with acetylxylan esterase activity are members of this family of hydrolases.

AB  == the polycentric anaerobic fungus orpinomyces joyonii a4 was cultivated on microcrystalline cellulose alone and in association with the rumen chitinolytic bacterium clostridium sp. strain chk5, which shows strong phenotypic similarity to clostridium tertium. the presence of strain chk5 significantly depressed the solubilization of microcrystalline cellulose, the production of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and the release of endoglucanase by the fungus. co-culture of the monocentric anaerobic fungus neocallimastix frontalis strain re1, neocallimastix  sp. strain g-1 and caecomyces sp. strain sc2 with strain chk5 also resulted in depressed fungal cellulolysis. cell-free supernatant fluids from strain chk5 inhibited the release of reducing sugars from carboxymethylcellulose by cell-free supernatant fluids from o. joyonii strain a4. strain 007 of the cellulolytic anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens was also shown to produce small amounts of soluble products upon incubation with colloidal chitin. mixtures of culture supernates from this bacterium and from o. joyonii strain a4 showed cellulase activity that was less than that of the component cultures. it is suggested that  the ability of some rumen bacteria to hydrolyse or transform chitin may be an important factor in the interactions between bacteria and fungi in the rumen.

TI  == enzymic studies on the animal and intestinal bacterial metabolism of geniposide.
AB  == geniposide, a main iridoid glucoside of gardenia fruit, is transformed to genipin, a genuine choleretic, in vivo in rats (aburada et al., j. pharmacobio-dyn., 1, 81 (1978)). as geniposide was not hydrolyzed to any metabolite by rat liver homogenate, which has beta-d-glucosidase and esterase activities, beta-d-glucosidases in intestinal bacteria seem to be required for an exhibition of its choleretic action. the crude extract of eubacterium sp. a-44, a human intestinal anaerobe, hydrolyzed geniposide, but that of ruminococcus sp. po1-3, another human anaerobe, did not, though both extracts had beta-d-glucosidase activities for p-nitrophenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside. only one  of three beta-d-glucosidases from e. sp. a-44 and none of two from r. sp. po1-3 hydrolyzed geniposide to genipin. however, carboxylesterases from e. sp. a-44 and pig liver were unable to hydrolyze geniposide to geniposidic acid, but hydrolyzed genipin to an aglycone of geniposidic acid, indicating that geniposide is first hydrolyzed to genipin by beta-d-glucosidases and subsequently to the aglycone of  geniposidic acid by esterases. thus, when geniposide is orally administered, genipin seems to be effectively produced in the intestine and then absorbed to act as a genuine choleretic.

AB  == seasonal changes in bacterial colonization of the epithelial tissue were examined in the rumen of high-arctic svalbard reindeer. samples of tissue were collected from eight sites in the rumen of reindeer during summer and winter and bacterial  colonization was examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. at two of these sites, colonization by adherent bacteria was estimated to cover approximately 30% of the ruminal epithelium in specimens collected from reindeer  during summer. bacteria at these sites resembled ruminococcus sp. and were surrounded by large amounts of glycocalyx. in winter specimens, less than 10% of  the epithelial surface was covered by adherent bacteria. those bacteria that did  colonize the epithelial surface were smaller and had virtually no glycocalyx on their surface. bacteria attached to plant cell wall material in summer samples of reindeer ingesta contained large intracellular glycogen deposits, whereas feed particle-associated bacteria in ingesta collected in winter contained no intracellular glycogen. these data demonstrate that the ruminal bacterial population responds to seasonal changes in feed intake and quality. it is yet to  be determined if these bacterial changes enhance the ability of svalbard reindeer to survive in the hostile environment of the high arctic.

AB  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. the total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x  10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7)  to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. the genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of diplodiniinae was higher (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (p less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). this was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic butyrivibrio isolates. the numbers of ruminococcus albus and r. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although r. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. in  vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (p less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. the concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enumeration and isolation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria from human feces.
AB  == the fibrolytic microbiota of the human large intestine was examined to determine  the numbers and types of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria present. fecal samples from each of five individuals contained bacteria capable of degrading the hydrated cellulose in spinach and in wheat straw pretreated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (ahp-ws), whereas degradation of the relatively crystalline cellulose in whatman no. 1 filter paper (pmc) was detected for only one of the five samples. the mean concentration of cellulolytic bacteria, estimated with ahp-ws as a substrate, was 1.2 x 10(8)/ml of feces. pure cultures  of bacteria isolated on ahp-ws were able to degrade pmc, indicating that interactions with other microbes were primarily responsible for previous low success rates in detecting fecal cellulolytic bacteria with pmc as a substrate. the cellulolytic bacteria included ruminococcus spp., clostridium sp., and two unidentified strains. the mean concentration of hemicellulolytic bacteria, estimated with larchwood xylan as a substrate, was 1.8 x 10(10)/ml of feces. the  hemicellulose-degrading bacteria included butyrivibrio sp., clostridium sp., bacteroides sp., and two unidentified strains, as well as four of the five cellulolytic strains. this work demonstrates that many humans harbor intestinal cellulolytic bacteria and that a hydrated cellulose source such as ahp-ws is necessary for their consistent detection and isolation.

TI  == enzymes involved in the formation of 3 beta, 7 beta-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5 beta-cholanic acid from dehydrocholic acid by ruminococcus sp. obtained from human intestine.
AB  == ruminococcus sp. po1-3 from human intestinal flora reduced dehydrocholic acid to  3 beta-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-5 beta-cholanic acid by means of the enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (akao, t., akao, t., hattori, m., namba, t. and kobashi, k. (1986) j. biochem. (tokyo) 99, 1425-1431). this bacterium and its crude extract gave rise to another product, showing a lower rf value on tlc, from dehydrocholic acid. the product was identified as 3 beta, 7 beta-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5 beta-cholanic acid. the crude extract reduced 7-ketolithocholic acid and its methyl ester, but not 6-ketolithocholic acid and 12-ketochenodeoxycholic acid, in the presence of nadph, and oxidized ursodeoxycholic acid and beta-muricholic acid, but not cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and hydrocholic acid, in the presence of  nadp+. therefore, besides 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was shown to be present in this bacterium. the  two dehydrogenases were clearly separated from each other by butyl-toyopearl 650  m column chromatography. from dehydrocholic acid, 7 beta-hydroxy-3,12-dioxo-5 beta-cholanic acid was produced by 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3 beta, 7 beta-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5 beta-cholanic acid was produced by combination of two enzymes, 7 beta- and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

TI  == purification and characterization of 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from ruminococcus sp. of human intestine.
AB  == 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7 beta-hsd) was produced by ruminococcus sp. po1-3 obtained from among human intestinal bacteria. the enzyme was purified from a crude extract by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and butyl-toyopearl 650m, sephadex g-150, matrex red a and octyl-sepharose chromatographies. the purified enzyme was obtained as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with enzyme activity staining and as one band corresponding to a molecular weight of 30,000 on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. on gel filtration, its apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 60,000. the enzyme had a sulfhydryl group(s) in its active site. substrate specificity studies revealed that the enzyme showed absolute specificity for the beta-configuration of a hydroxyl group at the 7 position of bile acids, and required nadp+ and nadph as cosubstrates. the km values for ursodeoxycholic acid, 7-k etolithocholic acid, nadp+, and nadph were 5.0, 8.5, 7.7, and 24 microm, respectively.

TI  == 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of ruminococcus sp. from human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == ruminococcus sp. po1-3 obtained from human intestinal flora is able to reduce dehydrocholate as well as 3-ketoglycyrrhetinate. from this bacterium dehydrocholate- and 3-ketoglycyrrhetinate-reducing activities were purified one thousand-fold together with 3-ketocholanate-reducing and 3-beta-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate (glycyrrhetic acid) oxidizing activities by means of matrex red a, sephadex g-200 and octyl-sepharose column chromatography. the purified enzyme catalyzed the reduction of dehydrocholic acid to 3 beta-hydroxy-7,12-diketocholanic acid and of 3-ketocholanic acid to 3 beta-hydroxycholanic acid. studies on substrate specificity revealed that the enzyme had absolute specificity for the beta-configuration of a hydroxyl group at the 3 position of bile acid and steroids having no double bond in the a/b ring. this enzyme was neither beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [ec 1.1.1.51] nor 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase [ec 1.1.1.145], but a novel type of enzyme, defined as 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
