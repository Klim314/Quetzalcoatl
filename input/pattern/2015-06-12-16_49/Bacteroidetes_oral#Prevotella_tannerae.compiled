TI  - Comparison of bacterial culture and 16S rRNA community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  - Culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. A consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum Actinobacteria. In this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16S rRNA genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects with active caries. Samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. A diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Selenomonas, and Streptococcus. The five most abundant species were: Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella denticola, Alloprevotella tannerae, S. mutans and Streptococcus sp. HOT 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. Two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of Prevotella species. The different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum Bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387R was used. All of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of Actinobacteria compared to culture. Pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than the clonal analysis. Pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of Actinobacteria compared to culture.
TI  - Description of Alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity, and reclassification of Prevotella tannerae Moore et al. 1994 as Alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  - Five strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these strains represented a novel group within the family Prevotellaceae, and the most closely related species was Prevotella tannerae. P. tannerae and the novel taxon are deeply branched from the genus Prevotella, with sequence identities to the type strain of the type species of Prevotella, Prevotella melaninogenica, of 82.2 and 85.6 %, respectively. The novel genus Alloprevotella gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the novel species Alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov. and the previously named Prevotella tannerae Moore et al. 1994 as Alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov. The type species is Alloprevotella tannerae. The type strain of Alloprevotella rava is 81/4-12(T) ( = DSM 22548(T) = CCUG 58091(T)) and the type strain of Alloprevotella tannerae is ATCC 51259(T) = CCUG 34292(T) = CIP 104476(T) = NCTC 13073(T). Alloprevotella rava is weakly to moderately saccharolytic and produces moderate amounts of acetic acid and major amounts of succinic acid as end products of fermentation. Strains are sensitive to 20 % bile and hydrolyse gelatin. The principal cellular long-chain fatty acids are anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, C16 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 47 mol%.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of Porphyromonas endodontalis, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Two different multiplex PCR protocols were used (one for the two Porphyromonas species and the other for the three Prevotella species), each one using a primer pair specific for each target species. The results were compared to those of the conventional culture procedures. Microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. Samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a Rapid ID 32 A kit. Multiplex PCR was processed using the DNA extracted from each sample. At least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (BPB) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex PCR, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. Multiplex PCR was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting BPB than the conventional culture procedures.
TI  - A new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. Most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' DNA-DNA hybridization method. METHODS: Fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). One diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. RESULTS: Twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). A significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, and Eikenella corrodens). Of the species in the new panel only Prevotella tannerae, Filifactor alocis, and Porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that P. tannerae, F. alocis, and P. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.
TI  - Isolation and identification of Prevotella tannerae from endodontic infections.
AB  - Black-pigmented bacteria are often isolated from endodontic infections. Five strains of black-pigmented bacteria isolated from endodontic infections could not be identified in our laboratory. The purpose of this study was to sequence the 16S rRNA gene of the five unknown isolates and identify the organisms. The 16S rRNA genes from the unknown organisms were cloned, sequenced, and determined to be Prevotella tannerae. In addition, samples from endodontic infections were surveyed for the presence of the organism. When 118 samples from endodontic infections were examined using polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for P. tannerae, 60% of the samples were positive for the presence of the organism. This suggests that P. tannerae is commonly present in endodontic infections and could be a potential pathogen.
TI  - Descriptions of Prevotella tannerae sp. nov. and Prevotella enoeca sp. nov. from  the human gingival crevice and emendation of the description of Prevotella zoogleoformans.
AB  - Prevotella tannerae sp. nov. and Prevotella enoeca sp. nov. from the human gingival crevice are described. These organisms are obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, nonmotile, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that ferment carbohydrates and produce succinic and acetic acids. Bile inhibits growth. Some strains (38%) of P. tannerae produce colonies with a tan to black pigment when they are grown on rabbit blood agar. The type strains are P. tannerae ATCC 51259 and P. enoeca ATCC 51261. In addition, the description of Prevotella zoogleoformans is emended to exclude strains now recognized as members of Prevotella heparinolytica.
