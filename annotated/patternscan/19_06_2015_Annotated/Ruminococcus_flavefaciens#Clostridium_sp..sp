TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), yaks (bos  grunniens) and yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in gayals, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle were investigated using pcr-dgge approach. the analysis of dgge profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16s rdna sequences in  dgge profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. dgge profiles revealed that gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of  intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. a total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. according to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen  dominant bacteria of gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the  genera lachnospiraceae bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium celerecrescens. moreover, the dominant bacteria of yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, schwartzia succinivorans and clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. in addition, the dominant bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing prevotella sp., staphylococci lentus, staphylococcus xylosus and corynebacterium casei. present study first detected staphylococcus lentus and staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == three neocallimastix patriciarum esterases associated with the degradation of complex polysaccharides are members of a new family of hydrolases.
AB  == acetylesterase and cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activities were demonstrated in culture supernatant of the anaerobic ruminal fungus neocallimastix patriciarum. a cdna expression library from n. patriciarum was screened for esterases using beta-naphthyl acetate and a model cinnamoyl ester compound. cdna clones representing four different esterase genes (bnaa-d) were isolated. none of the enzymes had cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity, but two of the enzymes (bnaa and  bnac) had acetylxylan esterase activity, bnaa, bnab and bnac encode proteins with several distinct domains. carboxy-terminal repeats in bnaa and bnac are homologous to protein-docking domains in other enzymes from neocallimastix species and another anaerobic fungus, a piromyces sp. the catalytic domains of bnab and bnac are members of a recently described family of ser/his active site hydrolases [upton, c. & buckley, j.t. (1995). trends biochem sci 20, 178-179]. bnab exhibits 40% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the cele cellulase from clostridium thermocellum and bnac exhibits 52% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the xynb xylanase from ruminococcus flavefaciens. bnaa, whilst exhibiting less than 10% overall amino acid identity to bnab or bnac, or to any other known protein, appears to be a member of the same family of hydrolases, having the three universally conserved amino acid sequence motifs. several other previously described esterases are also shown to be members of this family, including a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase from aspergillus aculeatus. however, none of the other previously described enzymes with acetylxylan esterase activity are members of this family of hydrolases.

TI  == dockerin-like sequences in cellulases and xylanases from the rumen cellulolytic bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == recent analysis of the enda cellulase gene from ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 has  revealed that it encodes a product of 759 amino acids that provides the first example of a multidomain cellulase from a ruminococcus sp. following the family 5 catalytic domain in the predicted enda enzyme is a 282 amino acid domain of unknown function for which no close relationship was found to other protein sequences. however, the c-terminal sequences of enda contain a 34 amino acid threonine-rich linker connected to an 81 amino acid region, both of which show strong similarities to sequences present in two xylanases from r. flavefaciens 17. a distant relationship is evident between regions of the 80 amino acid sequences of enda, xynd and xynb and the duplicated 23 amino acid dockerin sequences found in cellulolytic clostridium sp., suggesting that as in clostridium sp. these sequences could mediate the binding of enzymatic polypeptides to another component in the cell surface enzyme complex of r. flavefaciens.

TI  == the effect of rumen chitinolytic bacteria on cellulolytic anaerobic fungi.
AB  == the polycentric anaerobic fungus orpinomyces joyonii a4 was cultivated on microcrystalline cellulose alone and in association with the rumen chitinolytic bacterium clostridium sp. strain chk5, which shows strong phenotypic similarity to clostridium tertium. the presence of strain chk5 significantly depressed the solubilization of microcrystalline cellulose, the production of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and the release of endoglucanase by the fungus. co-culture of the monocentric anaerobic fungus neocallimastix frontalis strain re1, neocallimastix  sp. strain g-1 and caecomyces sp. strain sc2 with strain chk5 also resulted in depressed fungal cellulolysis. cell-free supernatant fluids from strain chk5 inhibited the release of reducing sugars from carboxymethylcellulose by cell-free supernatant fluids from o. joyonii strain a4. strain 007 of the cellulolytic anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens was also shown to produce small amounts of soluble products upon incubation with colloidal chitin. mixtures of culture supernates from this bacterium and from o. joyonii strain a4 showed cellulase activity that was less than that of the component cultures. it is suggested that  the ability of some rumen bacteria to hydrolyse or transform chitin may be an important factor in the interactions between bacteria and fungi in the rumen.
