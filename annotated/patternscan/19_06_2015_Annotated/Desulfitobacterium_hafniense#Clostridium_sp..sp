TI  == resolution of culture clostridium bifermentans dph-1 into two populations, a clostridium sp. and tetrachloroethene-dechlorinating desulfitobacterium hafniense strain jh1.
AB  == clostridium bifermentans strain dph-1 reportedly dechlorinates tetrachloroethene  (pce) to cis-1,2-dichloroethene. cultivation-based approaches resolved the dph-1  culture into two populations: a nondechlorinating clostridium sp. and pce-dechlorinating desulfitobacterium hafniense strain jh1. strain jh1 carries pcea, encoding a pce reductive dehalogenase, and shares other characteristics with desulfitobacterium hafniense strain y51.

TI  == arsenate respiratory reductase gene (arra) for desulfosporosinus sp. strain y5.
AB  == desulfosporosinus sp. strain y5 is a spore-forming bacterium capable of dissimilatory arsenate reduction coupled to the oxidation of aromatic compounds.  in arsenate respiration, the arsenate respiratory reductase (arr) catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. our objective is to characterize the arra gene, encoding the arr, for desulfosporosinus sp. strain y5. oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the few arra gene sequences available at the time  and validated against positive and negative controls. the resulting arra-amplicon of approximately 2.0kb was cloned and sequenced. the arra from desulfosporosinus  sp. y5 is closely related to desulfitobacterium hafniense (similarity of 77% and  81% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively). phylogenetic topology based on the arra gene was partially congruent with that of 16s rrna-based analysis. this arra sequence will support the development of specific tracking probes for desulfosporosinus sp. y5 and the molecular characterization and monitoring of dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of non-cyanobacterial genome sequences for occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to cyanophycin synthetase and cloning of an active cyanophycin synthetase from acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587.
AB  == all publicly accessible microbial genome databases were searched for the occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to the cyanophycin synthetase (cpha) of synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 in order to reveal the capability of  microorganisms not belonging to the cyanobacteria to synthesize cyanophycin. among 65 genome sequences, genes homologous to cpha were found in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1 (encoding a protein homologous to cpha with 40% amino acid identity), bordetella bronchiseptica strain rb50 (39%), bordetella pertussis strain tohama i (39%), bordetella parapertussis strain 12822 (39%), clostridium botulinum strain atcc 3502 (39%), desulfitobacterium hafniense strain dcb-2 (38%) and nitrosomonas europaea strain atcc 25978 (37%). the gene homologous to cpha from acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587 was amplified by pcr, ligated to the vector pbluescript sk(-) downstream of the lac promoter and introduced into escherichia  coli. the recombinant strain of e. coli expressed cpha activity at up to 1.2 u/mg protein and accumulated cyanophycin to up to 7.5% of the cellular dry matter, indicating that cpha of acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587 is functionally active.  in acinetobacter sp. strain dsm 587 itself, cyanophycin accumulated to up to 1.4% of the total protein under phosphate-limited conditions, and cyanophycin synthetase activity was detected, which indicated the function of cyanophycin as  a storage compound in this strain.
