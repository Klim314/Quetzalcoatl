effectiveness of ozone against periodontal pathogenic microorganisms.
ozone has been proposed as an adjunct antiseptic in periodontitis therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of gaseous/aqueous ozone, in comparison with that of the established antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), against periodontal microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and parvimonas micra in planktonic or biofilm cultures were exposed, for 1 min, to gaseous ozone, aqueous ozone, chx, or phosphate-buffered saline (control). none of the agents was able to substantially reduce the a. actinomycetemcomitans count in biofilm cultures. in contrast, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. micra could be eliminated by 2% chx or by ozone gas at 53 gm(-3) . significantly greater antimicrobial effects were observed against planktonic cultures than against biofilm-associated bacteria. the rate of killing was influenced by the species of bacteria, and by the type and concentration of agent. there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of aqueous ozone (20 mug ml(-1) ) or gaseous ozone (>/= 4 gm(-3) ) compared with 2% chx but they were more effective than 0.2% chx. therefore, high-concentrated gaseous and aqueous ozone merit further investigation as antiseptics in periodontitis therapy. a safe system for applying gaseous ozone into the periodontal pocket that avoids inhalation still needs to be developed.
