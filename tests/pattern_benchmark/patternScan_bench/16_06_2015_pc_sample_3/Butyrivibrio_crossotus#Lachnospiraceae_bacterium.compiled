TI  - Is there interaction between gut microbial profile and cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease patients?
AB  - ABSTRACT Aim: To evaluate the gut microbial profile in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and evaluate the possible relationship with inflammation and cardiovascular risk. PATIENTS & METHODS: Markers inflammation plasma and bacterial community profile (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) were analyzed. RESULTS: The average number of bands was not different in healthy individuals and CKD patients. The number of bands was negatively associated with plasma levels of VCAM-1 in patients. Flavobacteriaceae bacterium and Listeria monocytogenes were found in patients and Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Butyrivibrio crossotus in healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: Although CKD patients did not present altered gut microbial profile, the sequencing of bands suggested a different microbiota between groups. The result suggests a possible relationship between gut microbiota and cardiovascular risk in CKD patients.
