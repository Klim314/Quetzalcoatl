TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == enterobacteria identification and detection of diarrheagenic escherichia coli in  a port complex.
AB  == the port complex of maranhao (pcm) is the second largest port complex in brazil,  receiving ships with large volumes of ballast water. to evaluate the microbiological quality of its waters, physicochemical parameters (ph and salinity), the number of coliforms (thermotolerants and totals), and the presence of enterobacterias and diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains were analyzed. in order to identify the presence of e. coli virulence genes target regions of the stx, elt, est, aggr, cvd432, ipah and eae nucleotide sequences were studied. the  presence of totals and thermotolerants coliforms were positive. analyzing the salinity parameter, a significant increase in total coliforms was observed during the rainy season. we identified the species escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae and edwardsiella tarda. out of the 51 e. coli isolated, two were positive for the elt gene and one was positive  for the cvd432 sequence, features of enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains, respectively. this study reveals that the pcm is contaminated by enterobacteria and diarrheagenic e.coli thus providing evidence regarding the risk of these bacteria being carried by ships to other countries, and draws attention to the input of fecal bacteria brought by ships in the port waters of maranhao.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of mentha longifolia l. and hydroalcoholic extract of zataria multiflora boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from mentha longifolia l. (m. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of zataria multiflora boiss. (z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumonia), enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of m. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. results: the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were observed by the aqueous extracts of m. longifolia. conclusions: in conclusion, it seems that z. multiflora and m. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of  the mentioned bacteria.

TI  == expansion of esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (st15, st147, st336) and epidemic plasmids (incr, incfiik).
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. an important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. this study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the university hospital olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. methods: for the period between 1 january 2000 and 31 december 2011, resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem,  piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. for the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of  defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (dddatb) based on the atc/ddd classification and in relative annual consumption (rdddatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. the relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using spearman's correlation. the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. results: a total of 113,027 isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. there was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and amikacin in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. also, there was significant correlation between resistance  to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. no relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. conclusion:  the study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.

TI  == selective antibiofilm effects of lucilia sericata larvae secretions/excretions against wound pathogens.
AB  == background. maggot debridement therapy (mdt), using lucilia sericata larvae, represents efficient, simple, and low-cost therapy for the treatment of chronic wounds. aim. the aim was to investigate the antibiofilm activity of maggot excretions/secretions (es) against biofilm of wound isolates staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae), and proteus mirabilis (p.  mirabilis). methods. quantification of biofilm formation, was carried out using a microtiter plate assay. proteolytic activity of maggot es was performed using skim milk agar plates. a solid phase extraction and reverse phase hplc c18 chromatography were employed to the isolate of maggot es antibiofilm compounds. results. maggot es at 100 mg/ml concentration significantly reduced biofilm formation thus disrupting established biofilm of e. cloacae. heat-treated es did  not show any antibiofilm activity towards e. cloacae. similar results were obtained in the case of s. aureus; however, the heat-treatment of maggot es did not affect its antibiofilm activity. moreover, a compound with molecular weight of 25 kda exhibiting antibiofilm activity was identified in maggot es. on the other hand, maggot es protected and even stimulated p. mirabilis biofilm formation. conclusions. our results suggest that maggot es may act selectively against different bacterial strain.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == a survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  == objectives: to learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (bhr) inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern china. methods: a multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids was developed and used to determine these bhr plasmids. the difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (mdro) and non-mdro were assessed using a chi-square test. results: the average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for incn, incp, incq, incw, and inca/c in descending order. the distribution of all five bhr plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. the prevalence rates of all five bhr plasmids in mdros were significantly higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb). conclusions: bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. the prevalence rates in mdro are higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for nfgnb.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of geranium oil against gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  == hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. they can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the  risk of their emergence. diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of  geranium oil against gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. the constituents  of geranium oil were specified by gc-fid-ms analysis. the micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. the tested geranium oil was efficacious against gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. the results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.

TI  == risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections caused by plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the ampc beta-lactamase (ampc)-producing enterobacteriaceae emerged worldwide. this study was conducted to determine the risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections (utis) caused by plasmid-mediated ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae. methods: patients who were diagnosed as community-onset utis caused by enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary-care teaching hospital from december 2010 to january 2012 were included. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates were excluded. we identified plasmid-mediated ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay). the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. results: among the 323 non-esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset utis, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for ampc. escherichia coli was the most  common ampc-producing organism (60%), followed by klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and  enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). the independent risk factors for acquisition of ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae included prior  history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (or) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (or = 4.049; 95% ci = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (or = 9.683; 95% ci = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). ampc-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. the most commonly identified plasmid-mediated ampc gene was blacit, followed by bladha/blaebc, and blamox. conclusion: for community-onset utis, ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. to treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered.

AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2007.
AB  == background: the data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) collected from taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against escherichia coli (n = 344), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and proteus mirabilis (n = 78). susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in 2013. the double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to  confirm production of esbl for isolates with cephalosporin mic >/= 2 mug/ml. results: a total of 175 isolates were verified as esbl producers. the rates of cefepime susceptibility among the esbl-producing isolates, according to clsi (eucast) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for e. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for k. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for e. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for p. mirabilis. using different cefepime mic breakpoints (mics >/= 16 mug/ml recommended by clsi  criteria and >/= 2 mug/ml by eucast criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting esbl producers among k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae than among the other two species. in addition, we also  found that the cefepime mic level of 1.0 mug/ml best distinguished non-esbl- from esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. conclusion: to detect esbls, clsi should revise the cefepime mic breakpoint against enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and ampc-producing enterobacteria in healthy broiler chickens, germany.
AB  == during 2010, we evaluated the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and ampc-producing enterobacteria in broiler chickens at slaughter. samples (70 carcasses and 51 ceca) from 4 flocks were analyzed by direct plating and after enrichment. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers were found in 88.6% and 72.5% of carcasses and ceca, respectively; ampc producers were found in 52.9% and 56.9% of carcasses and ceca, respectively. most isolates were identified as escherichia coli; enterobacter cloacae (cecum) and proteus mirabilis (carcass) were found in 2 samples each. molecular characterization revealed the domination  of ctx-m genes; plasmidic ampc was cit-like. phylogenetic grouping of e. coli showed types a (31.5%), b1 (20.2%), b2 (13.5%), and d (34.8%). these findings provide evidence that healthy broilers in germany are a source for the dissemination of transmissible resistance mechanisms in enterobacteria brought from the rearing environment into the food chain during slaughtering.

TI  == a novel c-type lysozyme from mytilus galloprovincialis: insight into innate immunity and molecular evolution of invertebrate c-type lysozymes.
AB  == a c-type lysozyme (named as mgclyz) gene was cloned from the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis. blast analysis indicated that mgclyz was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. the nucleotide sequence of mgclyz was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. the deduced mature peptide of mgclyz was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kd and a theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of 8.08. evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during  evolution. by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis, mgclyz transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. the optimal temperature and  ph of recombinant mgclyz (rmgclyz) were 20 degrees c and 4, respectively. the rmgclyz displayed lytic activities against gram-positive bacteria including micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria including vibrio anguillarum, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, proteus mirabilis and bacillus aquimaris. these results suggest that mgclyz perhaps play  an important role in innate immunity of m. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (vur) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough uti or not. methods: we compared children with infantile vur with recurrent uti (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent uti (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). the following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of uti episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). results: univariate cox survival-time regression showed that younger age  at first uti, a non-escherichia coli strain, bilateral and vur, high-grade vur, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (usg) significantly increased the risks of recurrent uti (p <.05 each). in multivariate analysis, timing of the uti episode (p = .015), a non-e. coli strain (p = .003), high grade (p = .012), and bilateral vur (p = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent uti. non-e. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent uti, respectively. conclusion: during the first year of life, the earlier the first uti then the higher the chance is for recurrent utis. higher grades of reflux, bilateral vur, and the first infection by a non-e. coli  strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent utis.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
AB  == background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness  of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several  surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans  were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring:  at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.

TI  == anti-biofilm effects of honey against wound pathogens proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == biofilm growth and its persistence within wounds have recently been suggested as  contributing factors to impaired healing. the goal of this study was to investigate the anti-biofilm effects of several honey samples of different botanical origin, including manuka honey against proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae wound isolates. quantification of biofilm formation was carried out using a microtiter plate assay. all honeys at a sub-inhibitory concentration of 10% (w/v) significantly reduced the biofilm development of both  isolates. similarly, at a concentration of 50% (w/v), each of the honeys caused significant partial detachment of pr. mirabilis biofilm after 24 h. on the other  hand, no honey was able to significantly detach ent. cloacae biofilm. in addition, treatment of ent. cloacae and pr. mirabilis biofilms with all honeys resulted in a significant decrease in colony-forming units per well values in a range of 0.35-1.16 and 1.2-7.5 log units, respectively. of the tested honeys, manuka honey possessed the most potent anti-biofilm properties. furthermore, methylglyoxal, an antibacterial compound of manuka honey, was shown to be responsible for killing biofilm-embedded wound bacteria. these findings suggest that manuka honey could be used as a potential therapy for the treatment of wounds containing pr. mirabilis or ent. cloacae.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == globally dispersed mobile drug-resistance genes in gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in a us urban general hospital.
AB  == mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (gnb) pathogens from the blood of inpatients  at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. of 376 gnb isolates, 167 (44 %) were escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different gnb species. among e. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). the most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfra17-aada5, found in 30 (25 %)  of 119 drug-resistant e. coli isolates and in one isolate of moraxella morganii.  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes were found in 16 e. coli isolates (10 %). these genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream e. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by e. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.

TI  == multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

TI  == dissemination of the rmtb gene carried on incf and incn plasmids among enterobacteriaceae in a pig farm and its environment.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the prevalence and characterization of 16s rrna methylase-producing bacteria in a pig farm and its environment in east china. methods: enterobacteriaceae isolates and metagenomic dna from 102 pig faecal samples from a pig farm and 97 soil samples taken in or around the farm were screened for the presence of 16s rrna methylase genes. the clonal relationships of 16s rrna methylase-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized. results: fifty-six rmtb-positive enterobacteriaceae isolates, including 54 escherichia coli, 1 morganella morganii and 1 proteus mirabilis, were recovered from 55 pig faecal samples. nineteen rmtb-positive bacteria, including 13 e. coli, 2 m. morganii, 2 leclercia adecarboxylata, 1 enterobacter aerogenes and 1 enterobacter cloacae, were recovered from 16 soil samples. among the 75 rmtb-positive isolates, 31 and 25 also carried the qepa and bla(ctx-m) genes, respectively. the qepa gene co-localized with rmtb on the f2:a-:b1 plasmids and the bla(ctx-m-65) gene co-localized with rmtb on the f33:a-:b- plasmids. the rmtb gene was also found to be associated with the incn plasmids. clonal transmission of rmtb-positive e. coli isolates was observed between different pig groups and soil samples. conclusions: both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread could be responsible for the dissemination of the rmtb gene in the pig farm and its environment. to our knowledge, this study is the first report of rmtb-positive bacteria from farmland soils and indicates that these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes could be acquired by humans through the food chain.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  == referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. in this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection (bsi). we identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with gram-negative bsi in a referral cohort of patients treated at mayo clinic hospitals and a population-based cohort of olmsted county, minnesota, residents between 1 january 1998 and 31 december 2007, respectively. multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. elderly patients aged >/=80 years with gram-negative bsi were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (or) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (ci) 0.30-0.62] as were females (or 0.63, 95% ci 0.53-0.74). after adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of escherichia coli (or 0.50, 95% ci 0.43-0.58) and proteus mirabilis (or 0.49, 95% ci 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.26, 95% ci 1.70-3.06), enterobacter cloacae (or 2.31, 95% ci 1.53-3.66), serratia marcescens (or 2.34, 95% ci 1.33-4.52) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (or 17.94, 95% ci 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented  in the referral cohort. we demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with gram-negative bsi had an influence on referral patterns. these factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.

TI  == plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in expanded spectrum beta lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae in morocco.
AB  == introduction: although independently acquired, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance appears to be linked with extended-spectrum or ampc-type beta-lactamases. since no data are available in african countries, the prevalence of qnr genes at the university hospital ibn rochd, casablanca, morocco, was investigated. methodology: between october 2006 and march 2007, the following 39  randomly selected non-duplicate enterobacteriaceae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl), representing 20% of esbl strains with respect to species and ward origin, were collected: escherichia coli (n = 16); klebsiella spp (n = 14); enterobacter cloacae (n = 8); proteus mirabilis (n = 1). antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to clsi guidelines. esbl detection was performed by the double disc diffusion test. a multiplex pcr was conducted to detect qnra, qnrb and qnrs genes that were confirmed by sequencing of the pcr product. results: the estimated overall prevalence of qnr reached 36% (n = 14; qnra, 10.25%; qnrb, 23.07%; qnrs, 2.56%). genes were identified in e. coli, klebsiella and enterobacter with a respective prevalence of 18.7%, 50% and 62.5%. the qnr genes were detected in nine wards and qnra1, qnrb1-b2-b4 and qnrs1 variants were identified. three genes were identified among nalidixic acid susceptible strains (n = 6); three of those were also susceptible to ciprofloxacin. among nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistant strains, all strains had qnrb. conclusions: this study highlights the high prevalence of qnr genes among esbl strains in the ibn rochd chu, casablanca. moreover, qnr were present in quinolone-susceptible strains which could lead to in vivo selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.

AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis.
AB  == ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis is a rare side effect. it has only been described in 10 case reports since 1989. however, recently we were confronted with two cases within 1 month. in one patient the vasculitis resolved  after termination of the ciprofloxacin therapy; in the other patient the ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis was superimposed on a severe forefoot infection, leading to progressive gangrene and a below-knee amputation.  ciprofloxacin is among the standard treatments for infected ischemic ulcers; in the rare case of ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis, it might be interpreted as progression of infection, instead of a complication of the treatment, thus leading to faulty diagnosis and treatment. the intention of this  case report is to raise awareness for anyone prescribing ciprofloxacin as treatment for infected diabetic and ischemic ulcers.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in brazil.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. in this study, 127 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at sao paulo, brazil, were submitted to analysis by pcr  with specific primers for bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m genes. from the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%)  morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) enterobacter cloacae were identified as esbl producers. bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of k. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. pcr results showed a high variety of esbl groups among strains, in nine different species. the results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == design and quality control of a pharmaceutical formulation containing natural products with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to determine the antibacterial and antifungal  activity as well as mutagenicity of sechium edule fluid extract and to obtain a pharmaceutical formulation with them. the extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, candida spp. and aspergillus spp. isolated from clinical samples from two hospitals of tucuman, argentina. non-toxicity and mutagenicity on both salmonella typhimurium ta98 and  ta 100 strains until 100 microg/plate were observed. a hydrogel with carbopol acrylic acid polymer containing s. edule fluid extract as antibacterial, antimycotic and antioxidant agent was obtained. microbiological, physical and functional stability of pharmaceutical formulation conserved at room temperature  for 1 year were determined. addition of antioxidant preservatives to store the pharmaceutical formulation was not necessary. the semisolid system showed antimicrobial activity against all gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi assayed. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from 20 to 800 microg/ml. its activity was compared with a pharmaceutical formulation containing commercial antibiotic and antifungal. a pseudoplastic behavior and positive thixotropy were observed. our current finding shows an antimicrobial activity of hydrogel containing s. edule extract on a large range of gram negative and gram positive multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. this topical formulation may be used as antimycotic and as antibacterial in cutaneous infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the argentine puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  == aim: the plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "puna" or "altiplano" of argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. materials and methods: the antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (baccharis boliviensis, chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, chuquiraga atacamensis, fabiana bryoides, fabiana densa, fabiana punensis, frankenia triandra, parastrephia lucida, parastrephia lepidophylla, parastrephia phyliciformis, tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi, formerly nccls). the antibiotic resistant clinical strains were  isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. results: the ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa. ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of baccharis, fabiana and parastrephia showed the highest levels of  antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant staphylococcus with mic values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. baccharis boliviensis and fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. the most interesting activity on  multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from chuquiraga atacamensis. parastrephia species showed activity against enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. the extracts were  bactericidal in most cases. conclusions: the presence of antibacterial activity in puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans  and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.

TI  == doripenem activity tested against a global collection of enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  == the emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates among enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne ampc producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. this scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. in this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against enterobacteriaceae, including esbl- and ampc-producing strains, were evaluated. a total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria,  except for doripenem (product package insert). overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/ml. esbl rates were higher among klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). derepressed ampc production-mediated resistance rates were highest among enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the asia-pacific and latin american regions. doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the esbl phenotype and derepressed ampc isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem mic(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). the observed increase in ampc- and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on  carbapenem empiric therapy. doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == urease-positive bacteria in the stomach induce a false-positive reaction in a urea breath test for diagnosis of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == this study investigated the influence of urease-positive non-helicobacter pylori  bacteria on the results of a urea breath test (ubt) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a ubt using film-coated [(13)c]urea tablets. the ubt was performed in  102 patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics for the eradication of h. pylori. urease-producing bacteria other than h. pylori were isolated and identified from the oral cavity and stomach. in 4/102 patients, the  ubt gave false-positive results. these false-positive results were found to be caused by the presence of urease-positive bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach. five bacterial species with urease activity (proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus aureus) were subsequently isolated from the oral cavity and/or stomach. as there was no correlation between the in vitro urease activity of urease-positive non-h. pylori bacteria and the ubt value, and all of the patients with a false-positive ubt result were suffering from atrophic gastritis, it is possible that the false-positive results in the ubt were a result of colonization of urease-positive bacteria and gastric hypochlorhydric conditions. thus, for the diagnosis of h. pylori infection using a ubt, the influence of stomach bacteria must be considered when interpreting the results.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

AB  == objectives: the ctx-m-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. we aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. methods: fifty-four ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(ctx-m-25) genes by pcr and sequencing. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by vitek-2. plasmids encoding bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by southern blot using a bla(ctx-m-25) probe. chromosomal location of bla(ctx-m-25)-type was studied by i-ceui restriction analysis. the bla(ctx-m-25)  genetic environment was characterized by pcr mapping and partial sequencing. results: ten out of 54 ctx-m-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(ctx-m-25) genes, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). isolates were genetically unrelated. four beta-lactamases were found: ctx-m-25, ctx-m-26, ctx-m-39 and ctx-m-41, a new member of the family (accession no. dq023162) that differed from ctx-m-25 in three amino acids, ala80val, val106ile and ile126ser. bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but p. mirabilis, organized in a class i integron and located downstream of an isecp1 element. the  genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. conclusions: bla(ctx-m-25) exists in israel in different enteric species. spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. ctx-m-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of p. mirabilis.

AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. methods: mics were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 s. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 526 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 escherichia coli, 854 klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 proteus mirabilis, 406 enterobacter cloacae, 387 citrobacter spp., 291 serratia marcescens, 621 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. results: ceftobiprole activity against mrsa (mic90 2 mg/l) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic90 0.5 mg/l) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant cons (mic90 2 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible cons (mic90 0.25 mg/l). activity against s. pneumoniae (mic90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/l; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/l; -resistant, 0.5 mg/l) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. ceftobiprole activity against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/l;  non-susceptible, >32 mg/l), p. aeruginosa (mic90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/l, non-susceptible, >32 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (mic90: >32 mg/l for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. as  with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant  isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or non-esbl mediated]. conclusions: ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against mrsa and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  == the aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (cbm) and nosocomial meningitis (nm) within 17 years nationwide survey. all cases of gram-negative bacillary cbm within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were cbm. those 24 cases were compared with all cbm (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, a. baumannii in 23 cases, ps.  aeruginosa in 15 cases and enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. among cbm, in 13 cases enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli 6, klebsiella pneumoniae 3, proteus mirabilis 2, enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases ps. aeruginosa and in 6  cases acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the only significant risk factor for cbm due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. however, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objectives: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (icus). ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms. however, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in vap. our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of  ertapenem in the treatment of vap caused by susceptible esbl strains. methods: ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of vap beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by esbl-producing gram-negative organisms. results: from june 2005 to june 2006, we  enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an icu and diagnosed with vap due to gram-negative esbl strains. causative organisms identified as esbl producers susceptible to ertapenem were klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), enterobacter cloacae (2), proteus mirabilis (2) and citrobacter freundii (2). clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. the drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. conclusions: we believe  this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. ertapenem appears to be suitable for esbl vap therapy. this pilot study suggests  subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  == objectives: antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. in this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. methods: between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. these rates  were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. results: a total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii group, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (p < or = 0.03). conclusions: laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

AB  == bacteria harbouring the novel qnra plasmid-mediated mechanism of quinolone resistance have been described in different countries, but the frequency of their occurrence has not been investigated. in total, 1,468 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae with quinolone resistance or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl) phenotypes were collected from eight teaching hospitals in france during 2002-2005 and screened for qnra. overall, 28 isolates (22 enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one klebsiella oxytoca and one proteus mirabilis) were positive for qnra, representing 1.9% of all isolates, 3.3% of esbl-producing isolates (22% of the e. cloacae isolates) and 0% of non-esbl-producing isolates. the prevalence of qnra among consecutive esbl-producing isolates in 2004 from the eight hospitals was 2.8% (18/639). of the qnra-positive isolates, 100% were intermediately-resistant or resistant to nalidixic acid, and 75% to ciprofloxacin. twenty-one of the 22 qnra-positive e. cloacae isolates were obtained from two hospitals in the paris area, and molecular typing and plasmid content analysis showed clonal relationships for five, three and two isolates, respectively. the qnra genetic environment was similar to that of the in36 integron. the remaining two isolates had qnra variants (30 and 29 nucleotide differences, respectively, compared with the original sequence) and an unknown genetic environment. the esbl gene associated with qnra was bla(shv-12) in most of the isolates, but bla(per-1) and bla(shv-2a) were found in two isolates. in france, it appears that qnra-positive isolates are predominantly e. cloacae isolates producing shv-12, and may be associated with the dissemination of an in36-like integron.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in taiwan: epidemiology, detection, treatment and infection control.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. esbls are most often plasmid-mediated. in taiwan, the prevalence of esbls in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in escherichia coli isolates. the most prevalent types of esbls are shv-5, shv-12, ctx-m-3, and ctx-m-14 in isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli, with differences  between institutions. shv-12 and ctx-m-3 have been reported as the most common esbls in isolates of enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively.  molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the esbl-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. the current esbl screen guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) are issued for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis. owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of esbl in an isolate co-harboring an ampc beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of esbls in an  institution with a high prevalence of esbl producers. carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. to retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives  for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.

TI  == bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  == the study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the outpatient service of the transplantation institute in warsaw. the patients enrolled into the study  had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. in the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures.  cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases  of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). eventually, urinary tract infection (uti) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic uti and 22 cases of asymptomatic uti) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. in cases where  urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: escherichia coli: 22 strains, enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of ralstonia picketii, streptococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. over 90% of gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. the only drug of similar efficacy, which  could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  == background & objectives: cockroaches (diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. their  involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in africa. methods: a study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. results: of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serretia marcescens, s. aureus, s. feacalis, s. epidermidis, aeromonas sp, candida sp, rhizopus sp, aspergillus sp, mucor sp, cysts of e. hystolitica, oocysts of c. parvum, c. cayetenensis and isospora belli, cysts of balantidium coli, ova of ascaris lumbricoides, anchylostoma deodunalae, enterobius vermicularis, ova trichuris trichura, larva of strongyloides stercoralis. cockroaches trapped in the toilets  of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. a bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines.  on the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. interpretation & conclusion: cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == [bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study].
AB  == bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study. between january and december 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the bact-alert system (14,960 fan aerobics, 3,855 fan anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 fan pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of buenos aires city, one of la plata city and three  of the buenos aires province. a total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; enterococcus faecalis 1; streptococcus pneumoniae 2; campylobacter spp 1; escherichia coli 1; enterobacter cloacae 1; enterobacteraerogenes 1; citrobacter freundii 1; klebsiella pneumoniae 1; proteus mirabilis 1; serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of  cryptococcus neoformans). of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the  anaerobic standard (65% were propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the fan aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by fan pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and  1.4% by fan anaerobic bottle. our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the bact-alert system is unnecessary.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == objective: to determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in yaounde, cameroon. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital between march 1995 and april 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). results: of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were enterobacteriaceae. a high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. the proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly  higher than that from outpatients (p < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. the rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. among enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in e. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most  important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). wild type (exclusively observed in e. coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). however, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (klebsiella spp. (3.5%), e. coli (2.6%), citrobacter spp. (0.7%), enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and p.  mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). however, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. conclusion: as the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.

TI  == [bacterial colonization of chronic wounds. studies on outpatients in a university dermatology clinic with special consideration of orsa].
AB  == in this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between january 2002 and may 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. we isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were staphylococcus aureus, 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 escherichia coli, 4 proteus mirabilis, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 2 serratia marcescens, 2 streptococcus group g und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. moreover we identified one patient with candida parapsilosis. therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. consequently, 30.4% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were orsa strains. all of the orsa isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the orsa-positive patients. in the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. beside the obligate resistance  to oxacillin, penicillin g, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the orsa was sensitive to ofloxacin. the results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of orsa.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == longitudinal trends in fluoroquinolone resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolates from inpatients and outpatients, 1989-2000: differences in the emergence and epidemiology of resistance across organisms.
AB  == we conducted a 12-year study to identify and compare trends in annual prevalence  of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from inpatients and outpatients in our health care system. a total of 46,070 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates underwent susceptibility testing. although there were significant increases in inpatient fq resistance for all enterobacteriaceae, fq resistance trends differed significantly across enterobacteriaceae (p<.001). for isolates obtained from outpatients, only escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis demonstrated significant increases in fq resistance (p<.001 for each). trends in outpatient fq resistance also differed significantly across enterobacteriaceae (p<.001). there were significant differences between inpatient and outpatient fq resistance trends for all enterobacteriaceae except p. mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae. although hospital-wide use of certain antibiotics correlated significantly with inpatient  fq resistance, these correlations differed substantially across organisms. efforts to elucidate the epidemiology of fq resistance and identify targets for intervention must recognize and account for the variability of fq resistance across organisms and clinical settings.

TI  == an in vitro study of the anti-microbial efficacy of a 1% silver sulphadiazine and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate cream, 1% silver sulphadiazine cream and a silver  coated dressing.
AB  == burn sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with major  burns. the use of topical anti-microbial agents has helped improve the survival in these patients. there are a number of anti-microbials available, one of which, silvazine (1% silver sulphadiazine (ssd) and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate), is  used only in australasia. no study, in vitro or clinical, had compared silvazine  with the new dressing acticoat. this study compared the anti-microbial activity of silvazine, acticoat and 1% silver sulphadiazine (flamazine) against eight common burn wound pathogens. methods: each organism was prepared as a suspension. a 10 microl inoculum of the chosen bacterial isolate (representing approximately  between 10(4) and 10(5) total bacteria) was added to each of four vials, followed by samples of each dressing and a control. the broths were then incubated and 10  microl loops removed at specified intervals and transferred onto horse blood agar. these plates were then incubated for 18 hours and a colony count was performed. results: the data demonstrates that the combination of 1% ssd and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (silvazine) results in the most effective killing of all bacteria. ssd and acticoat had similar efficacies against a number of isolates, but acticoat seemed only bacteriostatic against e. faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. viable quantities of enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis remained at 24h. conclusion: the combination of 1%  ssd and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (silvazine) is a more effective anti-microbial against a number of burn wound pathogens in this in vitro study. a clinical study of its in vivo anti-microbial efficacy is required.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. methods: all patients admitted to a  31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. results: of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. the lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. the main resistant microorganisms were enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  and enterobacter cloacae. the main susceptible microorganisms were enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible s. aureus (mssa), and proteus mirabilis. patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). the maximum degrees of organ failure during the icu stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant  organisms. conclusions: infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is  not an independent predictor for death. the development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the icu length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == a hospitalwide intervention program to optimize the quality of antibiotic use: impact on prescribing practice, antibiotic consumption, cost savings, and bacterial resistance.
AB  == several findings from argentina provide compelling evidence of the need for more  rational use of antimicrobial agents. thus, a multidisciplinary antimicrobial treatment committee for the development of a hospital-wide intervention program was formed to optimize the quality of antibiotic use in hospitals. four successive steps were developed during 6-month periods: baseline data collection, introduction of a prescription form, education, and prescribing control. sustained reduction of drug consumption was shown during the study (r2=0.6885; p=.01). total cost savings was 913,236 us dollars. to estimate the consumption of cefepime and aminopenicillin-sulbactam in relation to that of the third-generation cephalosporins, 2 indices were calculated: icfp and iams, respectively. decreasing resistance to ceftriaxone by proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae proved to be associated with increasing icfp. decreasing rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were related to increasing iams. the present study indicates that a systematic program performed by a multidisciplinary team is a cost-effective strategy for optimizing antibiotic prescribing.

AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro synergy studies using aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations against six species of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == background: combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. methods: to evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, burkholderia cepacia and pseudomanas aeruginosa. results: all aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index >0.5-4] or synergy (fic index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 p. mirabilis, 1 e. cloacae, 1 b. cepacia). aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (p. mirabilis, e. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (e. cloacae). aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. conclusion: additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. synergy involving aztreonam  and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities among enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized patients in the united states from 1998 to 2001.
AB  == longitudinal surveillance of enterobacteriaceae for antimicrobial susceptibility  is important because species of this family are among the most significant and prevalent human pathogens. to estimate rates of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among hospitalized patients in the united states, data from the surveillance network were studied for 14 agents tested against 10 species of enterobacteriaceae (n = 384,279) isolated from intensive-care-unit (icu) patients and non-icu inpatients from 1998 to 2001. cumulative susceptibility (percent) data for all species of enterobacteriaceae isolated from icu patients and non-icu inpatients, respectively, were ranked as follows: ampicillin-sulbactam (45.5 and  57.2) << ticarcillin-clavulanate (74.8 and 83.5) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (87.0 and 84.5) congruent with cefotaxime (82.9 and 92.6) = ceftazidime (82.3 and 91.0) = ceftriaxone (86.5 and 93.9) = piperacillin-tazobactam (83.5 and 90.5) < levofloxacin (89.3 and 90.6) = ciprofloxacin (91.0 and 91.7) < gentamicin (91.8 and 94.3) < cefepime (95.0 and 97.9) < amikacin (98.5 and 99.2) < imipenem (100 and 100) = meropenem (100 and 100). of those agents studied only susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (94 to 89%) and levofloxacin (93 to 89%) decreased in a stepwise manner from 1998 to 2001. decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility was most pronounced for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. for all species of enterobacteriaceae, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was more commonly observed in isolates with a single-drug resistance phenotype while  gentamicin and fluoroquinolone resistances were more common in isolates resistant to at least one additional class of antimicrobial agent. ongoing surveillance of  enterobacteriaceae will be particularly important to monitor changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility, as well as changes in the prevalence of isolates  resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

TI  == conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoh of enteric bacteria.
AB  == the rpoh regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from genbank and compared. in addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoh of yersinia frederiksenii and proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters p1, p4 and p5, to the sigma(e) promoter p3 and to boxes dnaa1, dnaa2, camp receptor protein (crp) boxes crp1, crp2 and box cytr present in escherichia coli k12, were identified in sequences of closely related  bacteria such as: e.coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. in more distant bacteria, y.frederiksenii and p.mirabilis, the rpoh regulatory region has a distal p1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria.  this study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoh gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. a second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to e.coli.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == ibc-1, a novel integron-associated class a beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum  properties produced by an enterobacter cloacae clinical strain.
AB  == a transferable beta-lactamase produced by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate  of enterobacter cloacae was studied. the bla gene was carried by a large (>80-kb) transmissible plasmid. nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments revealed  that it was part of a gene cassette carried by a class 1 integron along with other resistance genes, including aac(6')-ib. the encoded beta-lactamase, designated ibc-1, was a novel class a enzyme that hydrolyzed ceftazidime and cefotaxime and was inhibited by tazobactam and, to a lesser extent, by clavulanate. also, imipenem exhibited potent inhibitory activity against ibc-1. the enzyme consisted of 287 amino acid residues, including ser-237, cysteines at  positions 69 and 237a, and arg-244, which may be implicated in its interaction with beta-lactams. in amino acid sequence comparisons, ibc-1 displayed the highest similarity with the chromosomal penicillinase of yersinia enterocolitica, a carbenicillinase from proteus mirabilis gn79, the species-specific beta-lactamases of klebsiella oxytoca, and the carbapenemase sme-1. however, a phylogenetic association with established beta-lactamase clusters could not be conclusively shown.

TI  == characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  == during the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. the ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. the male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. the most common  causative agent was group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 31.8%), followed by escherichia coli (20%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%), enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. in contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after  seven days of age). ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. the most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. since 1991, gbs has overtaken e. coli as the leading cause of neonatal  bacterial meningitis. this was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. the results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == a novel ctx-m beta-lactamase (ctx-m-8) in cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolated in brazil.
AB  == to estimate the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in brazil, 18 strains from different species of the family enterobacteriaceae exhibiting a positive double-disk synergy test were collected by a clinical laboratory from several hospitals in rio de janeiro, brazil, in 1996 and 1997. four strains (proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter amalonaticus) hybridized with a 550-bp ctx-m probe. the p. mirabilis strain produced a ctx-m-2 enzyme. the e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and c. amalonaticus isolates harbored a bla gene which was identified by cloning and sequencing as a  bla(ctx-m) gene. e. coli hb101 transconjugants and the e. coli dh5alpha transformant harboring a recombinant plasmid produced a ctx-m beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 7.6 conferring a resistance phenotype characterized by a  higher level of resistance to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime, as observed with the other ctx-m enzymes. the deduced protein sequence showed a novel ambler class a ctx-m enzyme, named ctx-m-8, which had 83 to 88% identity with the previously described ctx-m enzymes. the phylogenic study of the ctx-m family including ctx-m-8 revealed four ctx-m types, ctx-m-8 being the first member of a new phylum of ctx-m enzymes. the evolutionary distances between the four types of ctx-m were large, suggesting that the four clusters branched off early from a distant unknown enzyme and that intermediate enzymes probably existed.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == comparison of five days versus seven days of incubation for detection of positive blood cultures by the bactec 9240 system.
AB  == the specimen capacity of blood culture systems is determined by the length of time that blood cultures are incubated. since the patient populations served by hospitals vary, individual laboratories should evaluate the relative cost and benefits of different testing regimens for their particular setting. to be cost-effective, the use of a 5-day rather than a 7-day protocol for the bactec 9240 system (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, usa) has been recommended. to evaluate whether the shorter schedule would be appropriate at the microbiology laboratory at the national cheng kung university medical center in tainan, taiwan, the yield from 5 days versus 7 days of incubation was compared using a total of 9653 blood specimens collected from 1 april to 30 september 1997. of the 1848 positive vials, 1822 (98.6%) were positive in the first 5 testing days; only 26 (1.4%) were positive on day 6 or 7. only five of the latter vials were judged to contain clinically significant organisms: one cryptococcus neoformans, one candida albicans, one enterobacter cloacae, one klebsiella pneumoniae, and one proteus mirabilis. two vials contained organisms whose clinical significance was categorized as unknown, while 19 contained organisms that were considered contaminants. these data suggest that, for the laboratory studied, the 5-day protocol for the bactec 9240 system is more cost-effective than the 7-day protocol and is adequate for detection of positive blood cultures.

TI  == the prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  == seventy-seven patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital, over an 11-year period. fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter. rarer pathogens included citrobacter species, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. all patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. the mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == imipenem resistance in aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a prospective study was undertaken to observe the emergence of resistance to imipenem, if any, among aerobic gram-negative bacteria. a total of 736 isolates were tested during 1994-95 and less than 1% of them were resistant to imipenem, whereas the next year ('95-'96) the rate increased to 11 of the 903 isolates tested. the resistant isolates during '94-'95 were all stenotrophomonas maltophilia whereas the spectrum of resistant bacterial species increased in '95-'96 to include pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii with a tendency to an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in the later part of the year. a majority (72%) of the resistant isolates were from  patients with burns, and burn wounds were most frequently infected with such organisms. these data suggest that over a period of time aerobic gram-negative bacteria may develop resistance to imipenem and the pool of such bacteria increases with extensive use of the drug. non-fermentative aerobic bacteria tend  to develop resistance faster with widespread dissemination than enterobacteriaceae. hospital burn units are a potential source of development of  such resistance.

TI  == chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a clinical strain of proteus mirabilis (cf09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (mic >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated mic of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. two  beta-lactamases with apparent pis of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an ampc-type beta-lactamase with a pi of 9.0. amplification by pcr with primers for  ampc genes (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii) of  a 756-bp dna fragment from strain cf09 was obtained only with c. freundii-specific primers. hybridization results showed that the ampc gene is only chromosomally located while the tem gene is plasmid located. after cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that  this ampc gene is close to blacmy-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions glu --> gly at position 22, trp --> arg at position 201, and ser --> asn at position 343. ampc beta-lactamases derived from that of c. freundii (lat-1, lat-2, bil-1, and cmy-2) have been found in klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, and enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. this is the first example of a chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase observed in p. mirabilis. we suggest that it be  designated cmy-3.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == multicenter laboratory evaluation of the biomerieux vitek antimicrobial susceptibility testing system with 11 antimicrobial agents versus members of the  family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a four-center study in which a total of 1,082 recent clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined versus  11 antimicrobial agents with the biomerieux vitek susceptibility test system (hazelwood, mo.) and the gns-f6 card was conducted. in addition, a challenge set  consisting of the same 200 organisms was examined in each of the four participating laboratories. results obtained with the vitek system were compared  to mics determined by a standardized broth microdilution method. for purposes of  comparison, susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) were assigned on the basis of the results of both methods. the result of the broth microdilution test was considered definitive. the total category error rate with the vitek system and the recent clinical isolates (11,902 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 4.5%, i.e., 1.7% very major errors, 0.9%  major errors, and 1.9% minor errors. the total category error rate calculated from tests performed with the challenge set (i.e., 8,800 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 5.9%, i.e., 2.2% very major errors, 1.1% major errors, and 2.6%  minor errors. very major error rates higher than the totals were noted with enterobacter cloacae versus ampicillin-sulbactam, aztreonam, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate and with p. aeruginosa versus mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. major error rates higher than the averages were observed with proteus mirabilis versus imipenem and with klebsiella pneumoniae versus ofloxacin. excellent overall interlaboratory reproducibility was observed  with the vitek system. the importance of inoculum size as a primary determinant in the accuracy of susceptibility test results with the vitek system was clearly  demonstrated in this study. specifically, when an inoculum density fourfold higher than that recommended by the manufacturer was used, high rates of false resistance results were obtained with cell wall-active antimicrobial agents versus both the enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

AB  == fresh clinical isolates collected from november 1, 1992 through november 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including  fk037 and l-ofloxacin. among the 10 040 organisms tested were staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, n = 455), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), escherichia coli (n = 2326), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), proteus mirabilis (n = 445), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). both l-ofloxacin and fk037 inhibited 98% of s. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. fk037 was at least 4 times  more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against mrsa, inhibiting  79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. while the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.

TI  == bacterial reduction of n-oxides of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (tsna).
AB  == 1. contrary to established metabolic pattern, a recent investigation of nnk metabolism produced in rat urine higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (nnk) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (nnal) than their n-oxides, suggesting that reconversion of n-oxides could occur after urine formation. 2. to verify the possible role of bacteria in the reduction of nnk-n-oxide and nnal-n-oxide to their respective parent compounds, nnk and nnal, in smokers with  urinary tract infection (uti), the n-oxides were isolated from the urine of rats  treated with [5-3h]nnk and individually incubated at 37 degrees c with ten bacterial species in sterile human urine under different ph regimens. after incubation with the bacteria, aliquots of culture media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) with radiochemical detection. 3. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis possessed varying capacity to regenerate nnk and nnal from their n-oxides while others showed no detectable reductive capability within 24 h. 4. this result constitutes the first experimental evidence that in tobacco users with concomitant uti, bacterial regeneration of the procarcinogenic nnk and nnal  from their n-oxides could occur in the bladder leading to increased carcinogen burden in these individuals.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial.
AB  == the aim of this multicentered, prospective and open study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam (4g/500 mg iv tid) in the treatment of 79 adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti) requiring hospitalization. forty-seven women and 32 men (mean age 54.2 years, and range 21-91) from 4 argentinean and 6 mexican hospitals were enrolled. sixty-one clinically and bacteriologically evaluable patients were treated for a mean of 9.1 days (range 5-15). a favorable clinical response was seen in 83.6% and 80% at early and late assessment, respectively. bacteriological eradication was achieved in 85.3% and 80% at early and late estimation, respectively. escherichia coli was isolated in 33 cases, klebsiella pneumoniae in 8, enterococcus spp. in 7, proteus mirabilis in 6, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3, enterobacter spp. and morganella morganii in 2. while 21% of all the clinical isolates were resistant to piperacillin, none of them was initially resistant to  piperacillin/tazobactam. however, one female patient with a persistent uti caused by e. coli developed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam during treatment. a 64-year-old man with frontal meningioma developed purulent meningitis due to enterobacter cloacae after neurosurgery. he was initially treated with ciprofloxacin, rifampin and amikacin and because of persistence of fever, he was  moved to piperacillin/tazobactam. after 5 days of therapy, he developed coma secondary to intracranial hemorrhage and died. by then, the platelet count was normal (220,000/microliters), but the prothrombin time (19.5 seconds) and the partial thromboplastin time (63 seconds) were significantly prolonged. our data suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a reliable therapy for complicated, non-complicated, community or hospital-acquired uti.

TI  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries.
AB  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis were investigated in 226 inpatients who sustained electrical burns over a period of 15 years. four patients who sustained thoracic and abdominal organ injuries were noted in this series. the patients had injuries of the small intestine, stomach, colon and the lung. all the patients received operative treatment. two of them died of sepsis. injuries to the internal organs should always be considered following high-voltage injuries, and they should be managed as early as possible. the data concerning wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries were evaluated in three  consecutive 5-year periods. over this period of 15 years, different antibiotic regimens were used for prophylaxis and treatment. most patients in the current series had been contaminated or infected by various pathogens prior to admission. long-lasting administration of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients showed  no improvement in controlling the sepsis. after 1987, most of the microorganisms  were eliminated following more effective antimicrobial therapy. the progressive decrease in infection frequency of species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae, appeared to be causally related to the changes in the general therapeutic protocol which included new antibiotics. the infections caused by e. coli and staphylococcus aureus showed a rather steady state. a marked increase in frequency of negative wound cultures was also noted between the years 1989 and 1993. a gradual decrease in mortality rates was observed from the first to the last 5-year period, whereas mortality rates due to sepsis showed a gradual but slower decline. sepsis (142 patients comprising 62.8  per cent of the total mortality rate) was the most frequent complication resulting in death.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities and comparative pharmacokinetics of meropenem and imipenem-cilastatin.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (sbas) of imipenem and meropenem were investigated in a randomized crossover study. twelve healthy male  volunteers received a constant 30-min infusion of either 1 g of imipenem plus 1 g of cilastatin or 1 g of meropenem. the concentrations of the drugs in serum and urine were determined by bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were based on an open two-compartment model and a noncompartmental technique. at the end of infusion, the mean concentrations of imipenem and meropenem measured in serum were 61.2 +/- 9.8 and 51.6 +/- 6.5 mg/liter, respectively; urinary recoveries were 48.6% +/- 8.2% and 60.0% +/- 6.5% of the dose in 12 h, respectively; and the areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity were 96.1 +/- 14.4 and 70.5 +/- 10.3 mg.h/liter, respectively (p < or = 0.02). imipenem had a mean half-life of 66.7 +/- 10.4 min; that of meropenem was 64.4 +/- 6.9 min. the volumes of distribution at steady state of imipenem and meropenem were 15.3 +/- 3.3 and 18.6 +/- 3.0 liters/70 kg,  respectively, and the mean renal clearances per 1.73 m2 were 85.6 +/- 17.6 and 144.6 +/- 26.0 ml/min, respectively. both antibiotics were well tolerated in this single-dose administration study. the sbas were measured by the microdilution method of reller and stratton (l. b. reller and c. w. stratton, j. infect. dis. 136:196-204, 1977) against 40 clinically isolated strains. mean reciprocal bactericidal titers were measured 1 and 6 h after administration. after 1 and 6 h the median sbas for imipenem and meropenem, were 409 and 34.9 and 97.9 and 5.8, respectively, against staphylococcus aureus, 19.9 and 4.4 and 19.4 and 4.8, respectively, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 34.3 and 2.2 and 232 and 15.5, respectively, against enterobacter cloacae, and 13.4 and 2.25 and 90.7 and 7.9, respectively, against proteus mirabilis. both drugs had rather short biological elimination half-lives and a predominantly renal route of elimination. both carbapenems revealed high sbas against clinically important pathogens at 1 h; meropenem had a higher sba against e. cloacae and p. mirabilis, and the sba of imipenem against s. aureus was greater than the sba of meropenem.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == inhibitory action of metabolites of pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter  cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against  s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of  p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against  a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of  a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive  and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains  were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == infection and antibiotic therapy in 4000 burned patients treated in milan, italy, between 1976 and 1988.
AB  == the pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. the most frequent isolates were: pseud. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteriaceae, such as acinetobacter, citrobacter. the most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant enterococcus isolates. staph. aureus, klebsiella and e. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. e. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and p. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of enterococcus spp. and e. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == nonspecific reactions of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (tecra) for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods.
AB  == a staphylococcal enterotoxin visual immunoassay kit (tecra) has recently become commercially available. since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types a to e (sea to see) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. in this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of sea, seb, and sec in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar  to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of sea per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of seb per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of sec per ml. however, the tecra kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than staphylococcus aureus, such as enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. the substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees c, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel). the problem of false-positive results with the tecra kit could be resolved by heat treatment (2 min at 100 degrees c) or by cleanup procedures involving metal chelate affinity chromatography with copper chelate sepharose for 4 h before use  of the tecra kit.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

AB  == meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. for nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower mic90 values compared to imipenem against strains of serratia marcescens, enterobacter  cloacae and escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against proteus mirabilis isolates. activity was similar to that of imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry for bacterial chemotaxonomy: influence of culture age, growth temperature, gaseous environment and extraction technique.
AB  == extracted phospholipids of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae were examined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry which yielded major peaks between m/z 225 and 761. the result of extracting freeze-dried or 'wet' cells showed that freeze-drying may be omitted although weighing of dried cells offers a useful means of standardizing the extraction procedure. anaerobic  growth quantitatively altered the chemical finger-print as a result of increase in ratio of saturated: unsaturated carboxylic acids. growth temperature also affected profiles over the temperature range 24-45 degrees c. a less drastic influence on mass spectra was culture age, over the range 16-48 h. comparison of  spectra was possible with pearson's coefficient of linear correlation which yielded the following values: wet and lyophilized cells, r = 0.97; aerobic and anaerobic growth, r = 0.82; 24 degrees c and 45 degrees c, r = 0.76; 16 h and 48  h, r = 0.95. these results show that although quantitative differences do occur between spectra for the same organism prepared in different ways, they are less than interspecies variation, e.g. with e. coli and p. mirabilis, r = 0.46. any differences which are due preparation method can be overcome by standardization of technique.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited  group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c  and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml,  and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae  ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.

TI  == efficacy and safety of oral cefixime therapy in common infectious diseases in children.
AB  == twenty-nine children, including 20 boys and 9 girls, were enrolled in an open trial of oral cefixime therapy for common pediatric infectious diseases. patients aged between 0.5 month and 12 years with a mean +/- standard deviation of 2.3 +/- 2.8 years. the diagnoses included 10 of acute otitis media, 2 of purulent rhinitis, 4 of acute enterocolitis, and 13 of urinary tract infection. most children received 6-12 mg/kg/day of cefixime granules, orally twice daily for more than five days. all 10 cases (100%) of acute otitis media and 2 cases of purulent rhinitis were either cured, or improved by oral cefixime treatment. none of them was microbiologically evaluable. four cases (100%) of acute enterocolitis, 3 due to salmonella group b, one due to shigella flexneri, were also successfully treated with bacteria eradication. however, the cure rate of 13 cases of urinary tract infection was only 85% (11/13). seven escherichia coli and 4 proteus mirabilis infections were eradicated, whereas one each of enterobacter  cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae infections did not respond to treatment; these  two cases had a complicated course. the overall cure and improvement rate was 93%. although five patients had transient episodes of mild diarrhea, no significant adverse reaction was observed. in summary, oral cefixime given twice  daily was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of common infectious diseases in pediatric patients.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (uti). patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. patients with uti were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. for patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, acinetobacter species, and k. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. infections by enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. for uti patients, e. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. all 14 uti patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. in the  ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by enterococcus species, and  in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by enterococcus species and one by enterobacter cloacae. intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.

AB  == time-kill studies and synergy testing were performed with blood culture isolates  from 80 patients with septicemia. ten isolates each of escherichia coli, proteus  mirabilis, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. the isolates were tested against netilmicin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, alone and in different combinations. cefotaxime was the most active agent against enterobacteriaceae, whereas netilmicin was the most active agent against p. aeruginosa and staphylococci. the most active antibiotic combinations were netilmicin-cefotaxime and netilmicin-piperacillin, where a synergistic activity was observed in 68 and  61%, respectively. the highest synergistic activity was against enterobacteriaceae, but the netilmicin-cefotaxime combination also acted synergistically against more than half of the s. aureus isolates. a relatively low synergistic activity was noted against p. aeruginosa. no case of antagonism was observed. subinhibitory concentrations of netilmicin, in combination with a greater than or equal to mic concentration of one of the tested beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly improved the killing of the isolates. netilmicin exerted a more rapid and pronounced bacterial reduction than the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == a regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  == from 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the netherlands. each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. the susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml in iso-sensitest broth (oxoid). no significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. there was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. in contrast, there was a general tendency to  an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == temocillin in the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.
AB  == temocillin is a beta-lactamase-stable penicillin with a selective. gram-negative  spectrum of activity and a long half-life. previous studies in adult patients have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in the treatment of gram-negative infections. the aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of temocillin in children with complicated urinary tract infections. twenty-two children, aged 3 months to 13 years (mean 5.8 years) were  treated with temocillin i.v. at a dose of 25 mg/kg 12 hourly for a mean period of 5.9 days (range 3-12 days). acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 21 patients (one case associated with septicaemia); one patient presented recurrent bacteriuria due to a multiresistant pathogen. some 20/22 children presented an underlying condition complicating the urinary tract infection (utl). the causative pathogens, isolated from the urine, were: e. coli (17), proteus mirabilis (3), enterobacter cloacae (1), enterococcus (1). the enterococcus and one proteus mirabilis were found to be resistant to temocillin. clinical improvement was obtained after 24-36 h in all children with temocillin-sensitive  organisms. bacteriological cure was obtained in all patients with temocillin-sensitive organisms. the two patients with temocillin-resistant pathogens were treated with another antibiotic. follow-up treatment was given per os during +/- 2 weeks. no adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory values were noted. in the authors' limited experience temocillin proved to be effective and safe in the treatment of pyelonephritis often due to ampicillin-resistant strains in children.

TI  == worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in japan, the united states, canada, france, austria, and hungary. standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. the susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for proteus mirabilis. susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on mueller-hinton-agar. clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro  activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter, haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides spp. no effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive proteus spp., ent. cloacae, serratia marcescens and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. the effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == ferric ammonium citrate decomposition--a taxonomic tool for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the iron uptake test of szabo and vandra has been modified and used for the differentiation of gram-negative bacteria. nutrient agar containing 20 g per litre of ferric ammonium citrate was distributed into narrow tubes and solidified so as to form butts and slants. considering the localization of the rusty-brown coloration produced after seeding and incubation, 2367 strains were classified into four groups. (1) unchanged medium: escherichia coli, shigella spp., yersinia spp., hafnia alvei and morganella morganii 100% each, klebsiella spp., 50%, enterobacter cloacae 37%, proteus vulgaris 59%, acinetobacter spp. 42%, pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: salmonella subgenera ii, iii and iv 98%, citrobacter freundii 65%, e. cloacae 55%, p. vulgaris 41%, proteus mirabilis 98%, providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative providencia 96%, acinetobacter spp. 58%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, p. fluorescens 81%, ufp (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads)  100%, other pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) unchanged slant, brown butt: s. typhi 88%,  salmonella subgenus i 3%, klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) rusty-brown slant, brown butt: salmonella subgenus i 75%, c. freundii 20%, klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. the localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in simmons' minimal and in kauffmann's peptone water medium.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.

AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == an evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980rp).
AB  == ceftiolene (42980rp) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. the affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight pbps of e. coli. enterobacter cloacae. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the affinity of ceftiolene for pbp1 of staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for pbp3. the bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against gram-negative organisms  was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into e. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene-  or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. growth of staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. these observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine mic determinations to distinguish  between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.

AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefoperazone (cpz) against clinical isolates including various beta-lactamase-producing strains were studied and compared with those of cefotiam (ctm). cpz had a broad spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. especially, cpz showed apparently more  potent antibacterial activities than ctm against enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, cpz was less active than ctm against staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. the stability and affinity of cpz for various types of beta-lactamase were also studied. cpz was more resistant to hydrolysis by typical cephalosporinase (csase) and cefuroximase (cxase) than ctm, but was less stable to penicillinase (pcase). cpz often showed  higher affinity to beta-lactamases than ctm. the study for the inducer-activity revealed that cpz hardly induced csase production in e. cloacae and proteus vulgaris while ctm highly induced in both strains. cpz was more active against csase-producers than ctm, especially against strains which inducibly produced the enzyme. it was speculated that this activity was responsible for the superior stability to csase and low inducer-activity for csase production.

TI  == superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of e-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of e-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and  gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. e-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (mic50) of 25 micrograms for staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with streptococcus faecalis resistant. e-0702 had mic50s against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but mic90s were higher than those of the other agents. it was as active as the other  agents against proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, providencia spp., morganella spp., and proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. activity against bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. e-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. there was an inoculum effect for e. cloacae, serratia spp., morganella spp., and pseudomonas spp.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. a comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of aztreoman (sq 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam inhibited 90% of citrobacter diversus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris and salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. this activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and shigella species. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited  by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. there was no major difference between mbc and mic values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon mic values was observed at 10(7) cfu.

TI  == evaluation of the updated ms-2 bacterial identification system in comparison with the api 20e system.
AB  == the recently updated ms-2 bacterial identification system software (abbott laboratories, diagnostic division, irving, tex.) was compared with the original ms-2 bacterial identification software and the api 20e, using 968 strains of enterobacteriaceae. the updated ms-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. api 20e and the original ms-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. ms-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. the percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic  groups were tested. direct comparison of the two ms-2 programs showed that the updated ms-2 software increased the identification accuracy of salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, providencia stuartii, escherichia coli, shigella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter  calcoaceticus. a decrease in accuracy was seen with citrobacter freundii, hafnia  alvei, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. the remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. the updated ms-2 software appears to significantly improve the  identification accuracy of the ms-2 bacterial identification system.

TI  == comparative study of fosfomycin activity in mueller-hinton media and in tissues.
AB  == fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  l-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. the latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. the relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus  was studied in mueller-hinton broth. an almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin  activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. fosfomycin activity against staph. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of  the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of fosfomycin against staph. aureus streptococcus faecalis, e. coli, ent. cloacae, pr. mirabilis, and ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in mueller-hinton broth. with few exceptions the mics in mueller-hinton broth (with  glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).

TI  == norfloxacin versus cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections.
AB  == in a randomised prospective study 61 patients with lower urinary tract infection  received either 200 mg norfloxacin (33 patients) or 480 mg cotrimoxazole (28 patients) twice daily for ten days. pathogens included escherichia coli in 48 patients, proteus mirabilis in ten patients, and enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and staphylococcus saprophyticus in one patient  each. the mics of norfloxacin and cotrimoxazole were less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l and less than or equal to 1 mg/l respectively. on the tenth day of treatment 94% of the patients receiving norfloxacin and 89% of the patients receiving cotrimoxazole were clinically cured, and the pathogens were eradicated in 94% and 96% of the patients respectively. at six week follow-up one patient given cotrimoxazole and two given norfloxacin had a reinfection. no side-effects or toxicity were observed with the exception of a diffuse rash in one patient receiving cotrimoxazole in whom treatment was discontinued. it is concluded that  norfloxacin is safe and as effective as cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower uti and should have an important role to play whenever multiresistant organisms are implicated.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance in a general hospital: a two year survey.
AB  == for two years transferable antibiotic resistance (tar) was studied by replicator  methods in strains of enterobacteriaceae isolated in a 900-bed hospital. transfer to an escherichia coli recipient was demonstrated in 21% of 7,800 enterobacteriaceae. it was most common in klebsiella (37% of isolates) and least  in acinetobacter (6%). the mean number of phenotypic resistance markers (rms) transferred was higher from klebsiella pneumoniae or enterobacter cloacae than from e. coli or p. mirabilis. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae especially transferred 7 or more rms much more often than other species. some rms were associated with a particular species, e.g. streptomycin with e. coli, kanamycin or gentamicin with  e. cloacae and kanamycin with p. mirabilis. the same was true of certain patterns of resistance transfer, e.g. ap-km and p. mirabilis, ap-sm and e. coli, ap-km-gm-tm-cm and k. pneumoniae. however, many of the commonest resistance phenotypes were transferred from several species and from several biotypes within any given species. resistance patterns transferred from e. coli were detected sporadically throughout, whereas many of those transferred from klebsiella, enterobacter or proteus were found only for a limited time.

TI  == cefotetan: profile of in-vitro activity.
AB  == cefotetan, a novel 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, was shown to be comparable to other third-generation cephalosporins when tested in vitro against 1063 gram-negative clinical isolates of 11 species. ninety per cent of all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii were inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan between 0.07 and 3.2 mg/l. activity against gram-positive cocci was about equal to that of moxalactam. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter were resistant. cefotetan inhibited about two-thirds of enterobacter strains at 16 mg/l. beta-lactamases of enterobacter cloacae highly resistant to cefotetan inactivated this cephamycin. these strains were resistant to most other beta-lactams as well. synergism between cefotetan and aminoglycosides was found in 8 out of 16 gram-negatives.

TI  == outer membrane permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == mutant strains lacking outer membrane protein(s) were isolated from escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. the outer membrane protein(s)  of p. mirabilis and e. cloacae corresponding to e. coli porin were identified on  the basis of their function, namely, their ability to allow the permeation of glucose as demonstrated by [14c]glucose uptake by intact cells. p. mirabilis has  only one outer membrane pore protein (molecular weight, 40,000), but e. cloacae has at least two such proteins (molecular weights, 37,000 and 39,000 to 40,000).  when the bacteria lost these proteins or porin, the outer membrane permeation of  cefazolin was found to be greatly reduced in these three species. such a change in the outer membrane permeation closely correlated with a significant decrease in the bacterial susceptibility to cephalosporins, including cefoxitin. these results suggested that the main pathway for cephalosporin permeation is the pore  made up of these proteins. the 39,000- to 40,000-molecular-weight protein in e. cloacae was also assumed to play an important role in the outer membrane permeation of tetracycline and chloramphenicol. on the other hand, the permeation route of penicillins was obscure. the susceptibility to penicillins, except in some cases, was little influenced by the absence of the proteins. ampicillin was  found to pass through the outer membrane via the same route as the cephalosporins, but the possibility that ampicillin and other penicillins possess another unknown route for outer membrane permeation could not be ruled out.

AB  == the mics of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and brl 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2am + 1ca), were measured for 331 enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. the mic values for mezlocillin and the combination 2am + 1ca were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. when investigated  separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca (escherichia coli and shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2am + 1ca (citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp. and indole-positive proteus as well as strains of e. coli and shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2am + 1ca than  to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant salmonella spp., proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae). this complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca  against enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.

TI  == the inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  == the beta-lactamase from klebsiella pneumoniae e70 behaved in a similar fashion to the tem-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. both enzymes  produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. in the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for tem-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for klebsiella beta-lactamase. biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. this decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. this cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. a 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of tem-2 beta-lactamase. hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. the stoichiometry of the interaction with klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. the penicillinase from proteus mirabilis c889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. the major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. the cephalosporinase from enterobacter cloacae p99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c). no irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. the rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with proteus and enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid ph.

AB  == the automicrobic system enterobacteriaceae biochemical card (ams-ebc; vitek systems, inc.) was evaluated in two clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 502 consecutive clinical isolates representing members of the family enterobacteriaceae were tested in parallel with the ams-ebc, api 20e, and enterotube ii systems. discrepancies between systems were resolved with the conventional methods of edwards and ewing (p. r. edwards and w. h. ewing [ed.], identification of enterobacteriaceae, 1972) and ewing and martin (w. h. ewing and w. j. martin, in manual of clinical microbiology, 1974) ams-ebc correctly identified 96.6% and incorrectly identified 3.4% of the isolates. when 12 or more isolates of a species were evaluated, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae posed the greatest challenge to the systems, with 92.6, 95.2, and 95.3%, respectively, being correctly identified. to confirm the accuracy of identification when all systems agreed, 93 randomly selected isolates were identified by conventional methods. the percent agreement was 100%. the reproducibility of triplicate determinations on 93 randomly selected isolates with the ams-ebc was 99.6%. the ams-ebc was found to be an easy, rapid, and accurate method for identification of enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis, with the mean mics varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. it had marked activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with a  mean mic of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against e. coli, k. aerogenes and ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean mics between 5 and 21 mg/l. these results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due  to strains of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of fr-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of fr-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(n-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the in  vitro activity of fr-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. in vitro activity of fr-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. the type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with mueller-hinton, heart infusion, or trypticase soy agars. fr-31564  was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and citrobacter. it was less active than fosfomycin against serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. fr-31564 inhibited a number of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. in the presence and absence of human blood fr-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and p. aeruginosa exposed to fr-31564 for  3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. fr-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with p. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. it was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with e. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime  required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to  8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited  78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics  for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae  and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefotaxime at various dosage levels in urinary tract infections (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study, 63 patients with various urinary tract infections were treated with cefotaxime in different dosages. they were aged from 10 to 82 years (mean: 59). the cases included 33 cystitis, 25 pyelonephritis, 4 chronic prostatitis and 1 orchiepididymitis. 85 strains of enterobacteria were identified: 20 e. coli, 2  citrobacter freundi, 5 proteus mirabilis, 12 indole positive proteus, 1 providentia, 11 klebsiella, 3 enterobacter cloacae and 31 serratia marescens and  liquefaciens. 80 of these strains had mic less than or equal to 1 mcg/ml (median: 0,12 mcg/ml). more than 2/3 of the patients were treated with a daily dose of 1.50 to 2 g, and 52 (median: 0.12 mcg/ml). more than 2/3 of the patients results  showed 43 cures (9 of these with reinfection) and 20 relapses. isolated enterobacteria strains were sensitive to cefotaxime in patients with recurrence.  relapses were due to underlying urological pathology. among reinfection organisms, only one, an enterobacter cloacae, was resistant to cefotaxime. the clinical, local, systemic and biological tolerance was good. cefotaxime has been  very effective in the treatment of severe urinary tract infections, especially in chronic pyelonephritis and cystitis, at an average daily dose of 2 g.

AB  == cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the c.s.f. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. compared to the m.i.c. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the c.s.f. are much higher than the m.i.c.'s. these results are comparable to those of previous studies. cefotaxime diffuses in the c.s.f. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against  haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == a comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  == the sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter species, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. all bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. all strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. only non-identical strains were used. a tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. the results showed that all strains of h. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. the other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. cefoperazone had potent activity against ps. aeruginosa. differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of bl-s786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against 90 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes, were studied by using an agar dilution procedure. comparison of geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentrations showed that bl-s786 was half as active as cefamandole against enterobacter species, 2 to 4 times more active than cefamandole against all other species, and 4 to 25 times more active than cefoxitin against all species. in vivo experiments employed acute protection tests in infected mice, using five isolates each of the five genera. drugs were administered intramuscularly in two doses 3 h apart at dosages of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per mouse. in most instances, bl-s786 was the most efficacious drug, being some 1.3 to 9.1 times more active than cefoxitin in all experiments and 1.5 to 8.7 times more active than cefamandole in most experiments. bl-s786 and cefamandole were comparable in activity in experiments with e. aerogenes, whereas bl-s786 was superior in experiments with e. cloacae.

TI  == in vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == cefaclor (lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (bl-s640, sk&f 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. they were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. cefaclor and cefatrizine were  found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the cephalosporins were particularly active against enterobacter cloacae. both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive proteus species.

TI  == a polyvalent human gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa: passive protection of mice against lethal infection.
AB  == as a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa (pg) were studied in acute infections in mice. pg was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of p. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse  protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of  p. aeruginosa. pg was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. the active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the igg type and undoubltedly is directed against the o-antigen. pg was was not protective against challenge with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against serratia marcescens. in a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced p. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to p. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. the apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. it is postulated that  the successful treatment of advanced p. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.

TI  == bl-s786, a new parenteral cephalosporin. ii. in vitro antimicrobial activity comparison with six related cephalosporins.
AB  == bl-s786 was compared by in vitro studies with 6 other parenteral cephalosporins (cefamandole, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephradine). the following parameters were assessed: comparative mics against a wide variety of bacterial isolates, mic/mbc comparisons and the effect of inoculum size on the mic. bl-s786 showed the greatest antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, c. diversus and salmonella species; was equal to cefamandole against e. coli, e. agglomerans and p. mirabilis; and was second to cefamandole against shigella, e.  tarda, c. freundii, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes and the pathogenic neisseriae. essentially no activity against serratia and pseudomonas species was observed. compared to the other cephalosporins tested bl-s786 showed poor activity against  staphylococci and streptococci. for most species tested, the mbc of the various cephalosporins was the same or within one dilution of their respective mics. however, for enterobacter and indole-positive proteus species, the mbc of bl-s786 and cefamandole was usually larger than or equal to 8-fold higher than the mics.  cefoxitin, on the other hand, showed little mic/mbc variations against indole-positive proteus species. inoculum size had only a small effect on the mics against most gram-negative species--in some instances greater than 64-fold increases in mic resulted by increasing inoculum size from 10(5) to 10(7) organisms per ml.

TI  == clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  == a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of  the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a  potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and  cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.

TI  == intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  == several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. the following species: proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -ii. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.

TI  == [approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  escherichia coli, carrying an r factor was investigated in various gram-negative  bacilli. the acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. the investigated strains were of the salmonella-arizona group, the klebsiella-aerobacter group, serratia marcescens, the proteus group, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them  was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. in the proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. only the sensitive strains  containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. all  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). all of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the klebsiella-aerobacter group and of s. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. with respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the r factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.
