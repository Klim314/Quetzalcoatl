TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. in addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. among them, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by dgge analysis. torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. yeast isolates pichia exigua, candida rugosa, t. delbrueckii, candida tropicalis, pichia kudriavzevii,  wickerhamomyces anomalus, and candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates lb. plantarum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus sp., and chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. only isolates of p. exigua and t. delbrueckii and all species of the genus bacillus identified  in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. all microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees c, and only the isolates belonging to hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees c. these characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of t. delbrueckii, p. exigua, and bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.

TI  == development of biocontrol agents from food microbial isolates for controlling post-harvest peach brown rot caused by monilinia fructicola.
AB  == an unconventional strategy of screening food microbes for biocontrol activity was used to develop biocontrol agents for controlling post-harvest peach brown rot caused by monilinia fructicola. forty-four microbial isolates were first screened for their biocontrol activity on apple fruit. compared with the pathogen-only check, seven of the 44 isolates reduced brown rot incidence by >50%, including four bacteria: bacillus sp. c06, lactobacillus sp. c03-b and bacillus sp. t03-c,  lactobacillus sp. p02 and three yeasts: saccharomyces delbrueckii a50, s. cerevisiae ye-5 and s. cerevisiae a41. eight microbial isolates were selected for testing on peaches by wound co-inoculation with mixtures of individual microbial  cultures and conidial suspension of m. fructicola. only two of them showed significant biocontrol activity after five days of incubation at 22 degrees c. bacillus sp. c06 suppressed brown rot incidence by 92% and reduced lesion diameter by 88% compared to the pathogen-only check. bacillus sp.t03-c reduced incidence and lesion diameter by 40% and 62%, respectively. the two isolates were compared with pseudomonas syringae ma-4, a biocontrol agent for post-harvest peach diseases, by immersing peaches in an aliquot containing individual microbial isolates and the pathogen conidia. treatments with isolates ma-4, c06 and t03-c significantly controlled brown rot by 91, 100, and 100% respectively. however, only isolates ma-4 and c06 significantly reduced brown rot by 80% and 15%, respectively when bacterial cells alone were applied. on naturally infected  peaches, both the bacterial culture and its cell-free filtrate of the isolate c06 significantly controlled peach decay resulting in 77 and 90% reduction, respectively, whereas the treatment using only the bacterial cells generally had  no effect. isolate c06 is a single colony isolate obtained from a mesophilic cheese starter, and has been identified belonging to bacillus amyloliquefaciens.  the results have clearly demonstrated that isolate c06 has a great potential for  being developed into a biocontrol agent.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == natural exopolysaccharides enhance survival of lactic acid bacteria in frozen dairy desserts.
AB  == viable lactic acid-producing bacteria in frozen dairy desserts can be a source of beta-galactosidase for persons who absorb lactose insufficiently. however, freezing kills many of the cells, causing loss of enzymatic activity. cultures selected for high beta-galactosidase activities and high survival rates in the presence of bile were examined for survivability during freezing in reduced-fat ice cream. encapsulated s. thermophilus strains survived better than their nonencapsulated mutants in reduced-fat ice cream after freezing and frozen storage at -29 degrees c for 16 d (28 vs. 19%). however, a small nonencapsulated  strain of lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus survived better than the large encapsulated strain in reduced-fat ice cream. factors that improved survival of encapsulated s. thermophilus 1068 in ice cream were 1) harvest of cells in the late-log phase of growth at 37 degrees c rather than at 40, 42.5, or 45 degrees c; 2) overrun at 50% rather than 100%; and 3) storage at -17 degrees c rather than -23 or -29 degrees c. survival of strain st1068 was unaffected by 1) neutralization of acid during growth or 2) substitution of nitrogen for air in building overrun.

TI  == sequence analysis of the aminoacylase-1 family. a new proposed signature for metalloexopeptidases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence analysis of the human and porcine aminoacylases-1, the carboxypeptidase s precursor from saccharomyces cerevisiae, the succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and corynebacterium glutamicum, the acetylornithine deacetylase from escherichia coli and dictyostelium discoideum and the carboxypeptidase g(2) precursor from pseudomonas strain, using the basic local alignment search tool (blast) and the position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast), allowed us to suggest that all these enzymes, which share common functional and biochemical features, belong to the same structural family. the three amino acid blocks which were found to be highly conserved, using the clustal w program, could be assigned to the catalytic active site, based on the general three-dimensional structure of the carboxypeptidase g(2) from the pseudomonas strain precursor. six additional proteins with the same signature have been retrieved after performing two successive psi-blast iterations using the sequence of the conserved motif, namely lactobacillus delbrueckii aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase, streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase y precursor, two bacillus stearothermophilus n-carbamyl-l-amino acid amidohydrolases and pseudomonas sp. hydantoin utilization protein c. the three conserved amino acid motifs corresponded to the following blocks: (i) [s, g, a]-h-x-d-x-v; (ii) g-x-x-d; and  (iii) x-e-e. this new sequence signature is clearly different from that commonly  reported in the literature for proteins belonging to the arge/dape/cpg2/yscs family.
