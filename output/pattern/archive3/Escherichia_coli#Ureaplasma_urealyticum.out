antimicrobial activity and molecular mechanism of the cres protein.
cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic (cres) protein, a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors (also known as cst8), exhibits highly specific, age-dependent expression in mouse testis and epididymis. the cres protein possesses four highly conserved cysteine residues which govern the overall conformation of the cystatins through the formation of two disulfide bonds. previous studies have revealed that other cystatin family members, such as cystatin 3 and cystatin 11, show antibacterial activity in vitro. this prompted us to investigate the potential antimicrobial activity of the cres protein. colony forming assays and spectrophotometry were used to investigate the effects of recombinant cres protein on escherichia coli (e. coli) and ureaplasma urealyticum (uu), respectively, in vitro. after incubation of e. coli with cres recombinant protein fused with glutathione-s-transferase (gst), a substantial decrease in colony forming units was observed, and the effect was dose and time dependent. furthermore, it took longer for uu to grow to plateau stage when incubated with gst-cres recombinant protein compared with the control gst. the antibacterial and anti-uu activities were not impaired when the cysteine residues of cres protein were mutated, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was not dependent on its disulfide bonds. functional analysis of three cres polypeptides showed that the n-terminal 30 residues (n30) had no antimicrobial activity while n60 showed similar activity as full-length cres protein. these results suggest that the active center of cres protein resides between amino acid residues 31 and 60 of its n-terminus. mechanistically, e. coli membrane permeabilization was increased in a dose-dependent manner, and macromolecular synthesis was inhibited on treatment with gst-cres. together, our data on the antimicrobial activities of cres protein suggest that it is a novel and innate antimicrobial protein which protecting the male reproductive tract against invading pathogens.
molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. to investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cdna of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cbd-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. their predicted peptides share identical n-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. the two longer isoforms, cbd-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the c terminus. to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cbd, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus; mics of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mics of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (candida albicans; mic of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and u. canigenitalium (mic of 200 mug/ml). antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mm. all three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. in situ hybridization indicated that cbd-1 was expressed primarily in sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. in contrast, cbd-2 was located primarily within leydig cells. the longest isoform, cbd-3, was detected in sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. the tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.
molecular characterization of thymidine kinase from ureaplasma urealyticum: nucleoside analogues as potent inhibitors of mycoplasma growth.
ureaplasma urealyticum (u. urealyticum), belonging to the class mollicutes, is a  human pathogen colonizing the urogenital tract and causes among other things respiratory diseases in premature infants. we have studied the salvage of pyrimidine deoxynucleosides in u. urealyticum and cloned a key salvage enzyme, thymidine kinase (tk) from u. urealyticum. recombinant uu-tk was expressed in e. coli, purified and characterized with regards to substrate specificity and feedback inhibition. uu-tk efficiently phosphorylated thymidine (dthd) and deoxyuridine (durd) as well as a number of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. all natural ribonucleoside/deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, except dttp, served as phosphate donors, while dttp was a feedback inhibitor. the level of uu-tk activity in u. urealyticum extracts increased upon addition of durd to the growth medium. fluoropyrimidine nucleosides inhibited u. urealyticum and m. pneumoniae growth and this inhibitory effect could be reversed by addition of dthd, durd or deoxytetrahydrouridine to the growth medium. thus, the mechanism of inhibition was most likely the depletion of dttp, either via a blocked thymidine kinase reaction and/or thymidylate synthesis step and these metabolic reactions should be suitable targets for antimycoplasma chemotherapy.
rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
a prospective study of cortical scarring in acute febrile pyelonephritis in adults: clinical and bacteriological characteristics.
previous reports have demonstrated lesions on computerized axial tomography (ct), and nuclear scintigraphy (dmsa) in acute pyelonephritis (pn). we undertook a prospective study of all patients presenting to our hospital with pn over 40 months. patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria, were treated with intravenous antibiotics. excluding two who were pregnant, all patients had imaging by intravenous urography (ivu), ct and dmsa during their admission. urine samples were collected prior to treatment. patients without ivu evidence of cortical scarring but with parenchymal defects on ct and/or dmsa underwent a repeat dmsa three or more months after the acute episode. of the 164 patients, 142 were female. e. coli was found in 116 patients. forty-six patients had an abnormality on ivu. of the 106 patients without ivu evidence of cortical scarring, 59 had a defect on ct and/or dmsa. late dmsa scans in 35 of these 59 patients showed a persistent abnormality in 77%. e. coli characteristics such as p-fimbriae and type 1 fimbriae were not predictive of acute imaging abnormalities. inhibition of e. coli growth by the addition of edta was highly predictive of acute ct and dmsa abnormalities with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 82.8%. acute pyelonephritis is often associated with acute ct and/or dmsa abnormalities which may evolve into renal cortical scars. acute scan abnormalities can be predicted by the presence of e. coli which were susceptible to edta in culture. late scarring could not be predicted by clinical features, response to treatment or antibiotic used.
effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of ureaplasma urealyticum.
all of the 14 serotype standard strains of ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. a 1 mm concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. the presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. this differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. for the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. for the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified. the effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. the concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus mycoplasma (m. hominis, m. fermentans, and m. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mm manganese. the latter concentration inhibited the growth of acholeplasma laidlawii and staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mm manganese had no effect on escherichia coli.
