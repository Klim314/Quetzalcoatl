TI  == thermochemical pre- and biological co-treatments to improve hydrolysis and methane production from poultry litter.
AB  == the biochemical methane potential (bmp) of raw poultry litter waste was assessed  in batch assays. biological co-treatment with clostridium cellulolyticum, caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticum and clostridium thermocellum as bioaugmentation strains, and thermochemical pre-treatments with lime and sodium hydroxide performed at different temperatures and pressures were applied as strategies to improve the bmp by favouring the hydrolysis of the cellulolytic material in the waste. anaerobic digestion of the raw waste allowed a specific methane production of 145 +/- 14 lch(4)kg(-1)vs, with 1% total solids and 0.72 g  vs(inoculum)g(-1)vs(waste). the pre- and co-treatments contributed to a significant increase (up to 74%) in the waste solubilisation when using c. saccharolyticum, but methane production did not improve considerably. therefore,  the conversion of soluble organic matter to methane was the limiting step of the  anaerobic digestion process of poultry litter waste.

TI  == cloning and dna sequence of the gene coding for clostridium thermocellum cellulase ss (cels), a major cellulosome component.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum atcc 27405 produces an extracellular cellulase system capable of hydrolyzing crystalline cellulose. the enzyme system involves a multicomponent protein aggregate (the cellulosome) with a total molecular weight  in the millions, impeding mechanistic studies. however, two major components of the aggregate, ss (m(r) = 82,000) and sl (m(r) = 250,000), which act synergistically to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, have been identified (j. h. d. wu, w. h. orme-johnson, and a. l. demain, biochemistry 27:1703-1709, 1988). to further study this synergism, we cloned and sequenced the gene (cels) coding for  the ss (cels) protein by using a degenerate, inosine-containing oligonucleotide probe whose sequence was derived from the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the cels protein. the open reading frame of cels consisted of 2,241 bp encoding 741 amino acid residues. it encoded the n-terminal amino acid sequence and two internal peptide sequences determined for the native cels protein. a putative ribosome binding site was identified at the 5' end of the gene. a putative signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues was adjacent to the n terminus of the cels protein. the predicted molecular weight of the secreted protein was 80,670. the cels gene contained a conserved reiterated sequence encoding 24 amino acid residues found in proteins encoded by many other clostridial cel or xyn genes. a  palindromic structure was found downstream from the open reading frame. the cels  gene is unique among the known cel genes of c. thermocellum. however, it is highly homologous to the partial open reading frame found in c. cellulolyticum and in caldocellum saccharolyticum, indicating that these genes belong to a new family of cel genes.
