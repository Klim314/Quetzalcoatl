TI  - A diverse range of bacterial and eukaryotic chitinases hydrolyzes the LacNAc (Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) and LacdiNAc (GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc) motifs found on vertebrate and insect cells.
AB  - There is emerging evidence that chitinases have additional functions beyond degrading environmental chitin, such as involvement in innate and acquired immune responses, tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and serving as virulence factors of bacterial pathogens. We have recently shown that both the human chitotriosidase and a chitinase from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium hydrolyze LacNAc from Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta-tetramethylrhodamine (LacNAc-TMR (Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta(CH2)8CONH(CH2)2NHCO-TMR)), a fluorescently labeled model substrate for glycans found in mammals. In this study we have examined the binding affinities of the Salmonella chitinase by carbohydrate microarray screening and found that it binds to a range of compounds, including five that contain LacNAc structures. We have further examined the hydrolytic specificity of this enzyme and chitinases from Sodalis glossinidius and Polysphondylium pallidum, which are phylogenetically related to the Salmonella chitinase, as well as unrelated chitinases from Listeria monocytogenes using the fluorescently labeled substrate analogs LacdiNAc-TMR (GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta-TMR), LacNAc-TMR, and LacNAcbeta1-6LacNAcbeta-TMR. We found that all chitinases examined hydrolyzed LacdiNAc from the TMR aglycone to various degrees, whereas they were less active toward LacNAc-TMR conjugates. LacdiNAc is found in the mammalian glycome and is a common motif in invertebrate glycans. This substrate specificity was evident for chitinases of different phylogenetic origins. Three of the chitinases also hydrolyzed the beta1-6 bond in LacNAcbeta1-6LacNAcbeta-TMR, an activity that is of potential importance in relation to mammalian glycans. The enzymatic affinities for these mammalian-like structures suggest additional functional roles of chitinases beyond chitin hydrolysis.
TI  - A new means to identify type 3 secreted effectors: functionally interchangeable class IB chaperones recognize a conserved sequence.
AB  - Many Gram-negative bacteria utilize specialized secretion systems to inject proteins (effectors) directly into host cells. Little is known regarding how bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are recognized as substrates of the secretion systems, limiting their identification through bioinformatic analyses. Many of these proteins require chaperones to direct their secretion. Here, using the newly described protein interaction platform assay, we demonstrate that type 3 secretion system class IB chaperones from one bacterium directly bind their own effectors as well as those from other species. In addition, we observe that expression of class IB homologs from seven species, including pathogens and endosymbionts, mediate the translocation of effectors from Shigella directly into host cells, demonstrating that class IB chaperones are often functionally interchangeable. Notably, class IB chaperones bind numerous effectors. However, as previously proposed, they are not promiscuous; rather they recognize a defined sequence that we designate the conserved chaperone-binding domain (CCBD) sequence [(LMIF)(1)XXX(IV)(5)XX(IV)(8)X(N)(10)]. This sequence is the first defined amino acid sequence to be identified for any interspecies bacterial secretion system, i.e., a system that delivers proteins directly into eukaryotic cells. This sequence provides a new means to identify substrates of type III secretion systems. Indeed, using a pattern search algorithm for the CCBD sequence, we have identified the first two probable effectors from an endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius. IMPORTANCE: Many Gram-negative pathogens utilize type 3 secretion systems to deliver tens of effectors into host cells. In order to understand the diverse ways that these organisms cause disease, it is necessary to identify their effectors, many of which require chaperones to be secreted. Here we establish that class IB chaperones are not promiscuous, as previously proposed, but rather recognize a conserved effector sequence. We demonstrate that pattern search algorithms based on this defined sequence can be used to identify previously unknown effectors. Furthermore, we observe that class IB chaperones from at least seven bacterial species are functionally interchangeable. Not only do they bind and mediate the delivery of their own set of effectors into host cells but they also bind to type 3 substrates from other bacteria, suggesting that inhibitors that block chaperone-effector interactions could provide a novel means to effectively treat infections due to Gram-negative pathogens, including organisms resistant to currently available antibiotics.
TI  - Attenuation of the sensing capabilities of PhoQ in transition to obligate insect-bacterial association.
AB  - Sodalis glossinidius, a maternally inherited endosymbiont of the tsetse fly, maintains genes encoding homologues of the PhoP-PhoQ two-component regulatory system. This two-component system has been extensively studied in facultative bacterial pathogens and is known to serve as an environmental magnesium sensor and a regulator of key virulence determinants. In the current study, we show that the inactivation of the response regulator, phoP, renders S. glossinidius sensitive to insect derived cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The resulting mutant strain displays reduced expression of genes involved in the structural modification of lipid A that facilitates resistance to AMPs. In addition, the inactivation of phoP alters the expression of type-III secretion system (TTSS) genes encoded within three distinct chromosomal regions, indicating that PhoP-PhoQ also serves as a master regulator of TTSS gene expression. In the absence of phoP, S. glossinidius is unable to superinfect either its natural tsetse fly host or a closely related hippoboscid louse fly. Furthermore, we show that the S. glossinidius PhoQ sensor kinase has undergone functional adaptations that result in a substantially diminished ability to sense ancestral signals. The loss of PhoQ's sensory capability is predicted to represent a novel adaptation to the static symbiotic lifestyle, allowing S. glossinidius to constitutively express genes that facilitate resistance to host derived AMPs.
TI  - Identification of the regulatory logic controlling Salmonella pathoadaptation by  the SsrA-SsrB two-component system.
AB  - Sequence data from the past decade has laid bare the significance of horizontal gene transfer in creating genetic diversity in the bacterial world. Regulatory evolution, in which non-coding DNA is mutated to create new regulatory nodes, also contributes to this diversity to allow niche adaptation and the evolution of pathogenesis. To survive in the host environment, Salmonella enterica uses a type III secretion system and effector proteins, which are activated by the SsrA-SsrB two-component system in response to the host environment. To better understand the phenomenon of regulatory evolution in S. enterica, we defined the SsrB regulon and asked how this transcription factor interacts with the cis-regulatory region of target genes. Using ChIP-on-chip, cDNA hybridization, and comparative genomics analyses, we describe the SsrB-dependent regulon of ancestral and horizontally acquired genes. Further, we used a genetic screen and computational analyses integrating experimental data from S. enterica and sequence data from an orthologous regulatory system in the insect endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, to identify the conserved yet flexible palindrome sequence that defines DNA recognition by SsrB. Mutational analysis of a representative promoter validated this palindrome as the minimal architecture needed for regulatory input by SsrB. These data provide a high-resolution map of a regulatory network and the underlying logic enabling pathogen adaptation to a host.
TI  - The insect endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius utilizes a type III secretion system for cell invasion.
AB  - Sodalis glossinidius is a maternally transmitted secondary endosymbiont residing  intracellularly in tissues of the tsetse flies, Glossina spp. In this study, we have used Tn5 mutagenesis and a negative selection procedure to derive a S. glossinidius mutant that is incapable of invading insect cells in vitro and is aposymbiotic when microinjected into tsetse. This mutant strain harbors Tn5 integrated into a chromosomal gene sharing high sequence identity with a type III secretion system invasion gene (invC) previously identified in Salmonella enterica. With the use of degenerate PCR, we have amplified a further six Sodalis inv/spa genes sharing high sequence identity with type III secretion system genes encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the inv/spa genes of Sodalis and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae have consistently identified a well-supported clade containing Sodalis and the enteric pathogens Shigella and Salmonella. These results suggest that Sodalis may have evolved from an ancestor with a parasitic intracellular lifestyle, possibly a latter-day entomopathogen. These observations lend credence to a hypothesis suggesting that vertically transmitted mutualistic endosymbionts evolve from horizontally transmitted parasites through a parasitism-mutualism continuum.
