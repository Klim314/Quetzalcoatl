TI  == the bactericidal activity of normal human serum against enterobacteriaceae rods with lipopolysaccharides possessing o-antigens composed of mannan.
AB  == background: the susceptibility of bacteria to the bactericidal activity of serum  depends on the structure and organization of the bacterial outer membrane. it is  known that the structure of the o-specific polysaccharide chain of lipopolysaccharide (lps) plays an important role in the resistance of bacteria to host immune defenses. objectives: the susceptibility of rods belonging to enterobacteriaceae family to the bactericidal activity of the normal human serum  (nhs) was examined. the mechanisms of complement activation were also investigated. material and methods: the study was carried out on 15 strains containing lpss with o-specific polysaccharides composed of mannan, belonging to  the following species: citrobacter freundii, c. werkmanii, c. braakii, c. youngae, hafnia alvei, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. the levels of  c3 and c4 complement components, igg and igm immunoglobulin in nhs were examined  using specific antibodies. the bactericidal activity of nhs and its preparations  (hs50/20, hsmgegta) was determined. lpss from e. coli 08 strains were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (sds). results: eleven strains were sensitive to nhs bactericidal activity, and four were resistant. only one group of strains was fully susceptible to nhs action. in three other groups, both sensitive and resistant strains were found. the majority of the strains remained susceptible to nhs activity irrespective of which pathway of serum activity was blocked. all e. coli 08 strains contained smooth-type lpss. conclusions: strains belonging to the same serotype showed variable susceptibility to the bactericidal action of normal human serum. two mechanisms of the bactericidal activity of nhs have been identified.

TI  == postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of cote d'ivoire.
AB  == the distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in cote d'ivoire, and their roles in the food  poisoning were evaluated. microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, bacillus spores, fungi and clostridium perfringens. the results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5)  to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged,  respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) and 1.3  +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) cfu g(-1). bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundi, enterobacter amnigenus, citrobacter youngae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and rhizopus spp., mucor spp., thamnidium spp., fusarium spp., moniliella spp. the fungi. escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not found. the occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in cote d'ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct haccp system during the production. attieke is especially a well-known product in west africa; hence, it  is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.

TI  == taxonomic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation in the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. only eight taxa, citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, c. youngae, c. braakii, c. werkmanii, citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, enterobacter gergoviae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed  both glycerol dehydrogenase type i (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. six other species, c. koseri, e. aerogenes, e. intermedium, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and k. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type i but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type ii (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type iii (induced by glycerol only) and type iv (induced by hydroxyacetone only). they were widely distributed  among the enterobacteriaceae. classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.
