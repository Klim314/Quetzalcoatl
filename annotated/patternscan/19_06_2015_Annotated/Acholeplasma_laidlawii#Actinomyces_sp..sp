TI  == [examination of cattle with respiratory diseases for mycoplasma and bacterial bronchopneumonia agents].
AB  == a total of 247 mycoplasma strains was isolated from 435 lungs, tracheobronchial secretions and nasal swabs originating from cattle with symptoms of bronchopneumonia. mycoplasma (m.) bovis was found 89 times (36%) and was the most common mycoplasma species in the lungs. m. bovirhinis, m. bovigenitalium, m. spec. and acholeplasma (a.) laidlawii were isolated 158 times (64%). among these  mycoplasmas m. bovirhinis was the most widespread species (114 isolations). in 55 cases (62%) m. bovis was associated with pasteurella or actinomyces (a.) pyogenes. the other mycoplasma species were found in 67 cases (42%) together with these bacteria. without mycoplasmas pasteurella and a. pyogenes occurred in 33 of the probes investigated (21%). beside mycoplasmas haemophilus (h.) somnus was isolated from 16 of 162 tracheobronchial secretions investigated. the results confirm earlier suppositions that in most of the cases bronchopneumonia of cattle is a multifactorial event, frequently associated with mycoplasmas--especially m.  bovis.
