TI  == multi-centre evaluation of mass spectrometric identification of anaerobic bacteria using the vitek(r) ms system.
AB  == accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. classic phenotypic methods for identification require long  turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification  of anaerobes. we present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance  of the vitek((r)) ms in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. five different  test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. multiple species were included for several of the genera. briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. mass spectra results were generated with the vitek((r)) ms, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the vitek((r)) ms database 2.0. results were confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. an additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. genus-level identification consisted of actinomyces, bacteroides and prevotella species. fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces neuii and bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other  anaerobes tested. vitek((r)) ms identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == effect of beta-lactamase inhibitors on beta-lactamases from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == three beta-lactamase inhibitors in clinical use--clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam--were investigated for their activity on beta-lactamases from bacteroides uniformis, clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium nucleatum. purification of the beta-lactamases was carried out by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and fplc. the inactivation of beta-lactamase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with nitrocefin as substrate. various concentrations of the inhibitors were preincubated at 30 degrees c together with the enzyme for different periods of time before determination of the beta-lactamase activity. the three beta-lactamases tested were more susceptible to tazobactam than to clavulanic acid and sulbactam. clavulanic acid  and sulbactam reduced the enzyme activity of the bacteroides uniformis beta-lactamase more effectively than the clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium  nucleatum beta-lactamases.

TI  == effect of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam on three different beta-lactamases from bacteroides uniformis, clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the effect of three beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam used in clinical practice were compared for their activity against purified beta-lactamases from bacteroides uniformis, clostridium butyricum and fusobacterium nucleatum. the enzymes from b. uniformis and c. butyricum were produced in fermenters under controlled growth conditions and the enzyme from f.  nucleatum was produced in batch cultures. purification of the beta-lactamases was achieved by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and fplc-technique. the degree of inactivation of beta-lactamase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with nitrocefin as the substrate. the inhibitors in various concentrations were preincubated at 30 degrees c together with the enzyme for different time periods (0.5-120 min) before determination of the remaining beta-lactamase activity. the inhibitors all decreased the activity of the beta-lactamases investigated. clavulanic acid and sulbactam were capable of reducing the enzyme activity of the b. uniformis beta-lactamase more effectively  than the c. butyricum and f. nucleatum beta-lactamases. all beta-lactamases tested were more susceptible to tazobactam than to clavulanic acid and sulbactam.

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
