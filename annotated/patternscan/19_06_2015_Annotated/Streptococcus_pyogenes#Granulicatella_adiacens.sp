TI  == identification and characterization of bacterial-binding property in the type iii repeat domain of fibronectin.
AB  == to characterize fibronectin binding with granulicatella adiacens, a causative agent of infective endocarditis, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human fibronectin and selected for their capacity to inhibit the fibronectin binding of the organism. thermolysin and lysyl-endopeptidase digests of fibronectin were characterized by western blot. the epitope of inhibitory monoclonal antibody was found in the central portion of fibronectin known as the  cell-binding domain, and not in the n-terminal portion known to be the binding region of most microbial species, e.g., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. while these two species could bind to both the n-terminal and central portion, escherichia coli and g. adiacens bind only to the latter. excess amounts of free fibronectin in the solution inhibited the bacterial adherence to the n-terminal fibronectin fragment, but not to the central region, thereby suggesting the central region plays a significant role for in vivo bacterial colonization in the presence of high concentrations of soluble fibronectin.

TI  == inhibition of fibronectin binding of some bacterial cells by subtle ph increase within the physiological range.
AB  == the fibronectin (fn)-binding ability of microorganisms is considered to be involved in their pathogenicities. granulicatella adiacens, a member of the oral  flora and a causative agent of culture-negative infective endocarditis, showed nearly maximum binding to immobilized fn at ph 7.2 but greatly reduced binding at a slightly higher ph 7.4 and almost no binding at ph 7.6 in the presence of physiological concentration of nacl (0.15 m). a similar ph-sensitive fn-binding property was noted with escherichia coli and abiotrophia defectiva, but not with  streptococcus pyogenes nor staphylococcus aureus. in contrast, bindings to laminin and fibrinogen observed for some of these strains were unaffected by the  same ph changes. this fastidious ph-dependency of fn-binding abilities of some bacteria warns that the ph condition must be seriously considered in the in vitro assay of bacterial adherence to fibronectin.
