TI  == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial  communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries  (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root  caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and  patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium  acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated  with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
