TI  == evaluation of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in an italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  == the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blakpc klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). the aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of cre in one italian hospital over a long period (3 years  surveillance, from may 2011 to april 2014). based on defined mic cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. molecular typing was performed using the rapd technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blakpc gene (73 kp, 4 escherichia coli - ec), 51 strains the blavim gene (44 kp, 3 ec, 2 enterobacter cloacae and 2 klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blandm gene (3 kp, 4 ec and one providencia stuartii), 3 the blaoxa-48 gene (2 kp, 1 ec), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-pcr amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the mics obtained with automated instrument and gradient mics of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement  with the results obtained with the gradient mic. the use of rapd allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blakpc and for blavim kp.

TI  == adverse effects of members of the enterobacteriaceae family on boar sperm quality.
AB  == semen samples collected in 2012 from 1785 boars belonging to five different breeds were recruited from the quality control laboratory of magapor sl, spain. these samples came from 43 boar studs and resulted from diluting the ejaculates in commercial semen extenders. evaluation of the semen sample characteristics (color, smell, ph, osmolality, concentration, motility of sperm cells, agglutination, acrosome integrity, short hypoosmotic swelling test, and abnormal  forms) revealed that they met the international standards. the samples were also  tested for the presence of aerobic bacterial contamination. in the present study, 14.73% (n = 263) of the semen samples were contaminated above 3 x 10(2) colony-forming units/ml with at least one type of bacteria. the enterobacteriaceae family was by far the major contaminant, being present in 40.68% of the contaminated samples (n = 107). bacterial strains of the enterobacteriaceae family isolated from boar semen samples were in order of incidence (percentage of the contaminated samples): serratia marcescens (12.55%), klebsiella oxytoca (11.79%), providencia stuartii (9.12%), morganella morganii (3.80%), proteus mirabilis (1.90%), and escherichia coli (1.52%). we have seen that the presence in semen samples of s. marcescens, k. oxytoca, m. morganii, or  p. mirabilis, but not p. stuartii or e. coli, was negatively associated with sperm motility (p < 0.05). the mean sperm concentration (p < 0.05), the mean percentage of spermatozoa with curled tails after the short hypoosmotic swelling  test (p < 0.01), and the incidence of morphologically normal acrosomes (p < 0.05) were also lower in semen samples infected with m. morganii compared with uninfected ones. moreover, p. mirabilis was negatively associated with the presence of abnormal forms. thus, on the basis of the pathological effects that some of these strains may have on boar sperm quality, bacterial contamination should always be examined in semen samples prepared for artificial insemination.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == volatiles emitted from eight wound-isolated bacteria differentially attract gravid screwworms (diptera: calliphoridae) to oviposit.
AB  == bovine blood inoculated with bacteria isolated from screwworm [cochliomyia hominivorax (coquerel) (diptera: calliphoridae)]-infested animal wounds was tested as an attractant for oviposition for gravid screwworms. eight species of gram-negative coliform (enterobacteriaceae) bacteria mixed with bovine blood singly or all species combined and incubated for various times produced volatiles that attracted gravid flies in a cage bioassay in varying numbers. in 15-min duration tests, volatiles from five species of bacteria (klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii) attracted more females than volatiles of the three species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter sakazakii, and serratia liquefaciens). in 1-h duration oviposition tests, volatiles from the substrate using the same five species of bacteria attracted more females to oviposit than the other three species. volatiles from 24-h incubation period elicited least attraction and oviposition whereas volatiles from the 48- and 72-h incubation period resulted in significantly more attraction and oviposition. attraction and oviposition decreased significantly when the substrates were incubated for 96 h. volatiles from substrate with all species of bacteria combined attracted a significantly higher percentage of flies to land and oviposit than those from substrates prepared with single species. it is possible that multiple active chemicals present in volatiles of the all-species substrate may act as synergists resulting in greater response than those observed with volatiles from single-species substrate. before oviposition flies took a bloodmeal from the oviposition substrate. it is possible that the oviposition is moderated by two different factors in screwworm-first, by using a chemical cue to land on a potential oviposition site and second, by using a bloodmeal to stimulate oviposition.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis.  however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against  pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == bacteriophage d: an incd group plasmid-specific phage.
AB  == the existence of the plasmid incompatibility group d was reaffirmed as a result of compatibility experiments done on plasmids r687, r711b, r778b and r840 which were previously tentatively accepted as constituting the group. the group was further delineated by the isolation of a phage, phage d, which adsorbed specifically to incd plasmid-encoded pili produced by escherichia coli k12 strains and strains of salmonella typhimurium, proteus morganii and klebsiella oxytoca harbouring one of these plasmids. plaque formation, like that of phage pilh alpha, was temperature sensitive in that plaques formed at 26 degrees c but  not at 37 degrees c. plaques were fairly clear, regular in outline and varied from pinpoint to about 1.5 mm in diameter on e. coli hosts where plaques were detected, but on the other hosts the plaques were more turbid and often irregular in outline. the phage did not plate (or propagate) on incd plasmid-carrying strains of providencia alcalifaciens, providencia stuartii or serratia marcescens. the phage had an isometric hexagonal outline with a diameter of about 27 nm. it contained rna and resembled two other rna-containing phages, m and pilh alpha, by being sensitive to chloroform. it adsorbed to the sides of the very distal ends of the shafts of incd plasmid-coded pili.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fr 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fr 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. it was less active (mic, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit  streptococcus faecalis or listeria monocytogenes. fr 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. fr 17027 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, and citrobacter diversus at  less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. some strains of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (mic, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). fr 17027 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species, or bacteroides species. activity was  minimally affected by growth conditions. fr 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
