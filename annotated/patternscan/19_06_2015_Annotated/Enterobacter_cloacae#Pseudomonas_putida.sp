TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == a bioinformatics approach to the determination of genes involved in endophytic behavior in burkholderia spp.
AB  == the vast majority of plants harbor endophytic bacteria that colonize a portion of the plant's interior tissues without harming the plant. like plant pathogens, endophytes gain entry into their plants hosts through various mechanisms. bacterial endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. the molecular bases of these plant-endophyte interactions are currently not fully understood. in the present study, a set of genes possibly responsible for endophytic behavior for genus burkholderia was predicted and then compared and contrasted with a number (nine endophytes from different genera) of  endophytes by comparative genome analysis. the nine endophytes included burkholderia phytofirmans psjn, burkholderia spp. strain jk006, azospirillum lipoferum 4b, enterobacter cloacae enhku01, klebsiella pneumoniae 342, pseudomonas putida w619, enterobacter spp. 638, azoarcus spp. bh72, and serratia  proteamaculans 568. from the genomes of the analyzed bacterial strains, a set of  bacterial genes orthologs was identified that are predicted to be involved in determining the endophytic behavior of burkholderia spp. the genes and their possible functions were then investigated to establish a potential connection between their presence and the role they play in bacterial endophytic behavior. nearly all of the genes identified by this bioinformatics procedure encode function previously suggested in other studies to be involved in endophytic behavior.

TI  == [comparison of phenotypic methods for the detection of beta-lactamases mbl in strains from the enterobacteriaceae family and non-fermentative bacilli isolated  from clinical specimens].
AB  == introduction: bacterial resistance is growing because of treatment a broad spectrum antibio- tics. gram-negative pathogens which producing carbapenemase are a one of major problem in many hospitals. rapid detection those strains provide an early inhibition of infection and control the expansion of microorganisms. the aim of work was to characterize the frequency of appearance mbls in specific groups of gram-negative bacilli which are resistant or intermediate to at least one of carbapenems. methods: bacterial isolates were collected from baby jesus clinical hospital from 2003 to 2009. pathogens were isolated from urine, blood, fluids, swab of the wound, pharyngeal swab. they were identified by the id 32 e (biomerieux, france) and vitek2. antimicrobial resistance was marked by the atb g-5 and atb ur (biomerieux, france). detection of metalo-beta-lactamases was tested by disk diffusion test recommended by the eucast. the dds test using imipenem, ceftazidime, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) and 2-mercaptopropionic acid (2-mpa). positive test was reading as enlargement of inhibition zone about imipenem- or ceftazidime-impregnated disk. results: of the  88 isolates, 32 come fromenterobacteriaceae and 56 from non-fermentative bacilli. all strains were tested of production of mbl by disk diffusion test. this method  used two inhibitors: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 2-mercaptopropionic acid. as a result of edta there was 45 mbl positive strains. in apply 2-mpa there was 55 mbl positive strains. both the edta and 2-mpa disk test showing the highest percentage of positive result in enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. conclusions: resistance to carbapenems in the non-fermentative bacilli occurs more often than  in the enterobacteriaceae. method with 2-mercaptopropionic acid was more effective to detect metallo-beta-lactamases than edta. concerns especially bacilli from enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == a novel c-type lysozyme from mytilus galloprovincialis: insight into innate immunity and molecular evolution of invertebrate c-type lysozymes.
AB  == a c-type lysozyme (named as mgclyz) gene was cloned from the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis. blast analysis indicated that mgclyz was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. the nucleotide sequence of mgclyz was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. the deduced mature peptide of mgclyz was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kd and a theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of 8.08. evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during  evolution. by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis, mgclyz transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. the optimal temperature and  ph of recombinant mgclyz (rmgclyz) were 20 degrees c and 4, respectively. the rmgclyz displayed lytic activities against gram-positive bacteria including micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria including vibrio anguillarum, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, proteus mirabilis and bacillus aquimaris. these results suggest that mgclyz perhaps play  an important role in innate immunity of m. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  == [investigation of the presence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) by pcr in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == diversity of bacteria nesting the plant cover of north sinai deserts, egypt.
AB  == north sinai deserts were surveyed for the predominant plant cover and for the culturable bacteria nesting their roots and shoots. among 43 plant species reported, 13 are perennial (e.g. fagonia spp., pancratium spp.) and 30 annuals (e.g. bromus spp., erodium spp.). eleven species possessed rhizo-sheath, e.g. cyperus capitatus, panicum turgidum and trisetaria koelerioides. microbiological  analyses demonstrated: the great diversity and richness of associated culturable  bacteria, in particular nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs); the majority of bacterial residents were of true and/or putative diazotrophic nature; the bacterial populations followed an increasing density gradient towards the root surfaces; sizeable populations were able to reside inside the root (endorhizosphere) and shoot (endophyllosphere) tissues. three hundred bacterial isolates were secured from studied spheres. the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacilli isolates belonged to bacillus megaterium, bacillus pumilus, bacillus polymexa, bacillus macerans, bacillus circulans and bacillus licheniformis. the family enterobacteriaceae represented by enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter sackazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia adorifera, serratia liquefaciens and klebsiella oxytoca. the non-enterobacteriaceae population was rich in pantoae spp., agrobacterium rdiobacter, pseudomonas vesicularis, pseudomonas putida, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, ochrobactrum anthropi, sphingomonas paucimobilis and chrysemonas luteola. gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus were reported inside root and shoot tissues of a number of tested plants. the dense bacterial populations reported speak well to the very possible significant role played by the endophytic bacterial populations in the survival, in respect of nutrition and health, of existing plants. such groups of diazotrophs are good candidates, as bio-preparates, to support the growth of future field crops grown in deserts of north sinai and irrigated by the water of el-salam canal.

TI  == class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in  southern china.
AB  == non-duplicate multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from january 2008 to december 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as  well as characterisation of gene cassettes. among 825 strains carrying the class  1 integrase gene inti1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and dna sequencing analyses. in addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in escherichia coli, six in klebsiella pneumoniae, six in enterobacter cloacae, three in enterobacter aerogenes, one in  proteus mirabilis, one in acinetobacter spp., one in stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in pseudomonas putida. among them, three cassettes, including had-like, deltamfs-1 and qnrvc-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.

TI  == development of a simple method for biotoxicity measurement using ultramicroelectrode array under non-deaerated condition.
AB  == in this paper, a mediated method by using ferricyanide under non-deaerated condition for biotoxicity measurement was proposed. ultramicroelectrode array (umea) was employed for effectively amplify the electrochemical signal from the total limiting currents to distinguish a little change in toxicity. five species  of microorganisms including two bacilli (escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae), two pseudomonas (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (trichosporon cutaneum) were employed. 3,5-dichlorophenol (dcp) was taken as the reference toxicant. the ic50 values we obtained were similar with the values obtained using in the deaerated method. e. coli was used as model test microorganism. the final concentration of ferricyanide is 45 mm, e. coli od600 8  and 1 h incubation were taken in optimum conditions in this study. four heavy metal ions (cr(6+), hg(2+), cd(2+) and bi(3+)) were examined under the optimum conditions. comparison with the results reported previously has confirmed that this method provided a simple and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals, especially advantageous for in situ monitoring of water system.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from vegetables with regards to the marketing stage (farm vs. supermarket).
AB  == the aim of this study was to elucidate whether and to what extent fresh produce from germany plays a role as a carrier and reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. for this purpose, 1001 vegetables (fruit, root, bulbous vegetables, salads and cereals) were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in germany and examined bacteriologically. phenotypic resistance of enterobacter cloacae (n=172); enterobacter gergoviae (n=92); pantoea agglomerans (n=96); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=295); pseudomonas putida (n=106) and enterococcus faecalis (n=100)  against up to 30 antibiotics was determined by using the microdilution method. resistance to ss-lactams was most frequently expressed by p. agglomerans and e. gergoviae against cefaclor (41% and 29%). relatively high resistance rates were also observed for doxycycline (23%), erythromycin (21%) and rifampicin (65%) in e. faecalis, for spectinomycin (28%) and mezlocillin (12%) in e. cloacae, as well as for streptomycin (19%) in p. putida. in p. aeruginosa, relatively low resistance rates were observed for the aminoglycosides amikacin, apramicin, gentamicin, neomycin, netilmicin and tobramycin (<4%); 11% was resistant to streptomycin. no glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were observed. resistance rates of bacteria isolated from farm samples were higher than those of the retail markets whenever significant differences were observed. this suggests that expressing resistance is at the expense of bacterial viability, since vegetables  purchased directly at the farm are probably fresher than at the supermarket, and  they have not been exposed to stress factors. however, this should not keep the customer from buying directly at the farm, since the overall resistance rates were not higher than observed in bacteria from human or animal origin. instead, peeling or washing vegetables before eating them raw is highly recommended, since it reduces not only the risk of contact with pathogens, but also that of ingesting and spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria.

TI  == cell-based biosensor for measurement of phenol and nitrophenols toxicity.
AB  == a cost-effective whole cell biosensor based on electrochemical technique to detect toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols has been developed. this method relied on the inhibition effect for respiratory chain activity of microorganism by toxicant, which was measured by chronoamperometry using mediator (ferricyanide). the current signals produced by suspended microorganisms and reoxidation of ferrocyanide were transformed to inhibiting efficiency directly, and 50% inhibiting concentration (ic(50)) was chosen as the quantitative standard of toxicity. the test microorganisms used here consist of three bacilli (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and alcaligenes faecalis), two pseudomonas (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (trichosporon cutaneum). 3,5-dichlorophenol (dcp) was taken as the reference toxicant. the results showed that the microorganisms which belong to the same bacterial family had similar trends of inhibitions on respiratory activity and similar ic50 values. by comparing the ic(50) values, p. fluorescens was the most  sensitive one to dcp toxicity, its ic(50) was estimated to be 4.2mg/l. ph 7.0 and together with the standard glucose-glutamic acid (gga) as an exogenous material were taken for optimum conditions in this study. here, p. fluorescens as model test microorganism was employed to assess toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols under the optimum conditions. ic(50) values of 291.4 mg/l for phenol, 64.1mg/l for 2-np, 71.4 mg/l for 3-np and 14.0mg/l for 4-np were determined at 60 min, respectively. comparison with the results of published data has confirmed that this cell biosensor is a sensitive and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals.

TI  == flavonoid glucuronides and a chromone from the aquatic macrophyte stratiotes aloides.
AB  == the first phytochemical analysis of the aquatic macrophyte stratiotes aloides afforded two new flavonoid glucuronides, luteolin 7-o-beta-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-d-glucopyranoside (1) and chrysoeriol 7-o-beta-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-d-glucopyranoside (2), as well  as the new 2-(2-hydroxypentyl)-5-carboxy-7-methoxychromone (5) and chrysoeriol 7-o-beta-(6-o-malonyl)glucopyranoside (3), which has been assigned via nmr data for the first time. additionally, free amino acids such as tryptophan, arginine,  leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine along with choline, cis-aconitic acid, the phenolic glycoside alpha-arbutine, the chlorophyll derivative phaeophorbide a, and the flavonoid glycoside luteolin 7-o-beta-(6-o-malonyl)glucopyranoside (4) were isolated. despite the low quantities obtained in some cases (between 50-300 microg), the structures of all  compounds were unambiguously elucidated by extensive nmr and ms experiments. with a delay of 2 days compound 1 (10 and 50 microm test concentration) strongly inhibited the growth of human sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas only a moderate growth inhibition of human patu 8902 carcinoma cells could be observed. compounds 1 and 2 showed no activities against the bacteria escherichia coli bw25113, pseudomonas pudida kt2440, and enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens.

TI  == intraspecific variation and interspecific differences in the bacterial and fungal assemblages of blue tit (cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (parus major) nests.
AB  == although interest in the relationship between birds and microorganisms is increasing, few studies have compared nest microbial assemblages in wild passerines to determine variation within and between species. culturing microorganisms from blue tit (cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (parus major) nests from the same study site demonstrated diverse microbial communities with 32 bacterial and 13 fungal species being isolated. dominant bacteria were pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and staphylococcus hyicus. also common in the nests were the keratinolytic bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and bacillus subtilis. dominant fungi were cladosporium herbarum and epicoccum purpurascens. aspergillus flavous, microsporum gallinae, and candida albicans (causative agents of avian aspergillosis, favus, and candidiasis, respectively) were present in 30%, 25%, and 10% of nests, respectively. although there were no  differences in nest mass or materials, bacterial (but not fungal) loads were significantly higher in blue tit nests. microbial species also differed interspecifically. as regards potential pathogens, the prevalence of enterobacter cloacae was higher in blue tit nests, while pseudomonas aeruginosa-present in 30% of blue tit nests-was absent from great tit nests. the allergenic fungus cladosporium cladosporioides was both more prevalent and abundant in great tit nests. using discriminant function analysis (dfa), nests were classified to avian species with 100% accuracy using the complete microbial community. partial dfa models were created using a reduced number of variables and compared using akaike's information criterion on the basis of model fit and parsimony. the best  models classified unknown nests with 72.5-95% accuracy using a small subset of microbes (n = 1-8), which always included pseudomonas agarici. this suggests that despite substantial intraspecific variation in nest microflora, there are significant interspecific differences-both in terms of individual microbes and the overall microbial community-even when host species are closely related, ecologically similar, sympatric, and construct very similar nests.

TI  == enhancing biodegradation of wastewater by microbial consortia with fractional factorial design.
AB  == batch experiments were conducted on the degradation of synthetic and municipal wastewater by six different strains, i.e., agrobacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterobacter cloacae, gordonia, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas putida. by applying a fractional factorial design (ffd) of experiments, the influence of each strain and their interactions were quantified. an empirical model predicting the treatment efficiency was built based on the results of the ffd experiments with an r(2) value of 99.39%. for single strain, enterobacter cloacae, gordonia and p. putida (p=0.008, 0.009 and 0.023, respectively) showed significant enhancement on organic removal in the synthetic wastewater. positive interaction  from enterobacter cloacae, gordonia (p=0.046) was found, indicating that syntrophic interaction existed, and their coexistence can improve total organic carbon (toc) degradation. verification experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of bioaugmentation by introducing three selected strains into an activated sludge reactor for treating municipal wastewater. the removal efficiency of toc with the bioaugmentation was increased from 67-72% to 80-84% at an influent toc concentration of 200mg/l. the results derived from this study indicate that the ffd is a useful screening tool for optimizing the microbial community to enhance  treatment efficiency.

TI  == pathogen prevalence and influence of composted dairy manure application on antimicrobial resistance profiles of commensal soil bacteria.
AB  == composting manure, if done properly, should kill pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella and escherichia coli o157:h7, providing for an environmentally safe product. over a 3-year period, samples of composted dairy manure, representing 11 composting operations (two to six samples per producer; 100 total samples), were  screened for salmonella and e. coli o157:h7 and were all culture negative. nonpathogenic bacteria were cultured from these compost samples that could theoretically facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance from the dairy to compost application sites. therefore, we collected soil samples (three samples per plot; 10 plots/treatment; 90 total samples) from rangeland that received either composted dairy manure (cp), commercial fertilizer (f), or no treatment (control, con). two collections were made appoximately 2 and 7 months following treatment application. soil samples were cultured for pseudomonas and enterobacter and confirmed isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. three species of enterobacter (cloacae, 27 isolates; aeroginosa, two isolates; sakazakii, one isolate) and two species of pseudomonas (aeruginosa, 11  isolates; putida, seven isolates) were identified. five enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin and one isolate was resistant to spectinomycin. all  pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, sulphachloropyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and  most isolates were resistant to chlortetracycline and spectinomycin. pseudomonas  isolates were resistant to an average of 8.6, 7.9, and 8 antibiotics for con, cp, and f treatments, respectively. no treatment differences were observed in antimicrobial resistance patterns in any of the soil isolates examined. results reported herein support the use of composted dairy manure as an environmentally friendly soil amendment.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

TI  == first countrywide survey of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases in gram-negative pathogens in italy.
AB  == metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) can confer resistance to most beta-lactams, including carbapenems. their emergence in gram-negative pathogens is a matter of  major concern. italy was the first european country to report the presence of acquired mbls in gram-negative pathogens and is one of the countries where mbl producers have been detected repeatedly. here, we present the results of the first italian nationwide survey of acquired mbls in gram-negative pathogens. of 14,812 consecutive nonreplicate clinical isolates (12,245 enterobacteriaceae isolates and 2,567 gram-negative nonfermenters) screened for reduced carbapenem susceptibility during a 4-month period (september to december 2004), 30 isolates  (28 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 pseudomonas putida isolate, and 1 enterobacter cloacae isolate) carried acquired mbl determinants. mbl producers were detected in 10 of 12 cities, with a predominance of vim-type enzymes over imp-type enzymes (4:1). although having an overall low prevalence (1.3%) and significant geographical differences, mbl-producing p. aeruginosa strains appeared to be widespread in italy, with a notable diversity of clones, enzymes,  and integrons carrying mbl gene cassettes.

AB  == the survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. the organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees c. the yeast that was tested, saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly  after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. the decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. the gram-negative bacteria tested, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of s. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than s. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. these values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. the gram-positive bacteria tested, lactobacillus acidophilus and enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. the excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable  to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == using light scatter signal to estimate bacterial biovolume by flow cytometry.
AB  == background: in the past decade, flow cytometry has become a useful and precise alternative to microscopic bacterial cell counts in aquatic samples. however, little evidence of its usefulness for the evaluation of bacterial biovolumes has  emerged in from the literature. methods: the light scattering and cell volume of  starved bacterial strains and natural bacterial communities from the black sea were measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively, in  order to establish a relationship between light scattering and cell volume. results: with the arc-lamp flow cytometer, forward angle light scatter (fals) was related to cell size in both the starved strains and natural communities, although regression parameters differed. we tested the predictive capacity of the fals verous cell size relationship in a bacterial community from the north sea. that analysis showed that a reliable bacterial biovolume prediction of a natural  bacterial community can be obtained from fals using a model generated from natural bacterial community data. conclusions: bacterial biovolume is likely to be related to fals measurements. it is possible to establish a generally applicable model derived from natural bacterial assemblages for flow cytometric estimation of bacterial biovolumes by light scatter.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

TI  == utilization of heterologous siderophores enhances levels of iron available to pseudomonas putida in the rhizosphere.
AB  == pseudomonas spp. have the capacity to utilize siderophores produced by diverse species of bacteria and fungi, and the present study was initiated to determine if siderophores produced by rhizosphere microorganisms enhance the levels of iron available to a strain of pseudomonas putida in this natural habitat. we used a previously described transcriptional fusion (pvd-inaz) between an iron-regulated  promoter (pvd) and the ice nucleation reporter gene (inaz) to detect alterations  in iron availability to p. putida. ice nucleation activity (ina) expressed from the pvd-inaz fusion by p. putida n1r or n1r pvd(-), a derivative deficient in the production of a pyoverdine siderophore, was inversely related to the concentration of ferric citrate in a culture medium. in culture, ina expressed by n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) was reduced in the presence of the ferric complex of pseudobactin-358, a pyoverdine siderophore produced by p. putida wcs358 that can  be utilized as a source of iron by n1r pvd(-). in the rhizosphere of cucumbers grown in sterilized soil, n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) expressed ina, indicating that iron availability was sufficiently low in that habitat to allow transcription of  the iron-regulated pvd promoter. coinoculation with wcs358 or n1r significantly decreased ina expressed by n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) in the rhizosphere, whereas coinoculation with a pyoverdine-deficient mutant of wcs358 did not reduce ina expressed by n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz). these results indicate that iron availability to n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) in the rhizosphere was enhanced by the presence of another strain of p. putida that produces a pyoverdine that n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) was able to utilize as a source of iron. in culture, strain n1r pvd(-) also utilized ferric complexes of the siderophores enterobactin and aerobactin as sources of iron. in the rhizosphere of cucumbers grown in sterilized soil, ina expressed by n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) was reduced in the presence of strains of enterobacter cloacae that produced enterobactin, aerobactin, or both siderophores, but ina expressed by n1r pvd(-) (pvd-inaz) was not altered in the presence of a mutant of e. cloacae deficient in both enterobactin and aerobactin  production. therefore, the iron status of p. putida was altered by siderophores produced by an unrelated bacterium coinhabiting the rhizosphere. finally, we demonstrated that ina expressed by n1r containing pvd-inaz in the rhizosphere differed between plants grown in sterilized versus nonsterilized field soil. the  results of this study demonstrate that (i) p. putida expresses genes for pyoverdine production and uptake in the rhizosphere, but the level of gene expression is influenced by other bacteria that coexist with p. putida in this habitat, and (ii) diverse groups of microorganisms can alter the availability of  chemical resources in microbial habitats on root surfaces.

TI  == self-transmissible mercury resistance plasmids with gene-mobilizing capacity in soil bacterial populations: influence of wheat roots and mercury addition.
AB  == a set of mercury resistance plasmids was obtained from wheat rhizosphere soil amended or not amended with mercuric chloride via exogenous plasmid isolation by  using pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida uwc1, and enterobacter cloacae be1 as recipient strains. the isolation frequencies were highest from soil amended with high levels of mercury, and the isolation frequencies from unamended soil were low. with p. putida uwc1 as the recipient, the isolation frequency was significantly enhanced in wheat rhizosphere compared to bulk soil.  twenty transconjugants were analyzed per recipient strain. all of the transconjugants contained plasmids which were between 40 and 50 kb long. eight selected plasmids were distributed among five groups, as shown by restriction digestion coupled with a similarity matrix analysis. however, all of the plasmids formed a tight group, as judged by hybridization with two whole-plasmid probes and comparisons with other plasmids in dot blot hybridization analyses. the results of replicon typing and broad-host-range incompatibility (inc) group-specific pcr suggested tht the plasmid isolates were not related to any previously described inc group. although resistance to copper, resistance to streptomycin, and/or resistance to chloramphenicol was found in several plasmids, catabolic sequences were generally not identified. one plasmid, pec10, transferred into a variety of bacteria belonging to the beta and gamma subdivisions of the class proteobacteria and mobilized as well as retromobilized  the incq plasmid psup104. a pcr method for detection of pec10-like replicons was  used, in conjunction with other methods, to monitor pec10-homologous sequences in mercury-polluted and unpolluted soils. the presence of mercury enhanced the prevalence of pec10-like replicons in soil and rhizosphere bacterial populations.

AB  == glycerol trinitrate (gtn) reductase, which enables agrobacterium radiobacter to utilize gtn and related explosives as sources of nitrogen for growth, was purified and characterized, and its gene was cloned and sequenced. the enzyme was a 39-kda monomeric protein which catalyzed the nadh-dependent reductive scission  of gtn (km = 23 microm) to glycerol dinitrates (mainly the 1,3-isomer) with a ph  optimum of 6.5, a temperature optimum of 35 degrees c, and no dependence on metal ions for activity. it was also active on pentaerythritol tetranitrate (petn), on  isosorbide dinitrate, and, very weakly, on ethyleneglycol dinitrate, but it was inactive on isopropyl nitrate, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, ammonium ions, nitrate, or nitrite. the amino acid sequence deduced from the dna sequence was homologous (42 to 51% identity and 61  to 69% similarity) to those of petn reductase from enterobacter cloacae, n-ethylmaleimide reductase from escherichia coli, morphinone reductase from pseudomonas putida, and old yellow enzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae, placing  the gtn reductase in the alpha/beta barrel flavoprotein group of proteins. gtn reductase and petn reductase were very similar in many respects except in their distinct preferences for nadh and nadph cofactors, respectively.

AB  == glutathione-s-transferase (gst) activity was determined in 36 species of rhizosphere bacteria with the substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (cdnb) and in 18 strains with the herbicide alachlor. highest levels of cdnb-gst activity (60 to 222 nmol (middot) h(sup-1) (middot) mg(sup-1)) were found in gram-negative bacteria: enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella planticola, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and xanthomonas campestris. there was very low cdnb-gst activity in the gram-positive strains. rapid metabolism of cdnb-glutathione conjugates, attributable to high levels of (gamma)-glutamyltranspeptidase, also occurred in the gram-negative bacteria, especially pseudomonads. alachlor-gst activity detected in cell extracts and whole-cell suspensions of some strains of the families enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae was 50- to 100-fold lower than cdnb-gst activity (0.5 to 2.5 nmol  (middot) h(sup-1) (middot) mg(sup-1)) and was, for the most part, constitutive. the glutathione-alachlor conjugate was rarely detected. cysteineglycine and/or cysteine conjugates were the major products of alachlor-gst metabolism. whole-cell suspensions of certain pseudomonas spp. dechlorinated from 20 to 75% of 100 (mu)m alachlor in 24 h. results indicate that rhizosphere bacteria, especially fluorescent pseudomonads, may play an important role in the degradation of xenobiotics such as alachlor via gst-mediated reactions.

TI  == the role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  == the microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-o, dnase-b, hyaluronidase, streptozyme). giemsa smears and koh preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups a, b, c, d, f, g, s viridans, s pneumoniae; klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; escherichia coli; enterobacter cloacae, e aerogenes, e agglomerans; proteus mirabilis, p vulgaris; citrobacter freundii, c diversus; morganella morganii; pseudomonas aeruginosa, p maltiphilia, p putida; serratia marcescens; acinetobacter calbio aceticus, a luoffi; flavobacterium specie; cdc groups ve-1, ve-2, e-o2; bacillus subtilis, cereus; staphylococcus aureus; candida albicans, c parapsilosis; torulopsis, glabrata; rhodotorula and dermatophytes. one or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. titers to hepatitis e were elevated in one patient and to hiv in two patients.

TI  == [identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  == results of identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including p. fluorescens (63), p. putida (9), p. maltophilia (12), p. putrefaciens (2), and p. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of alcaligenes, both identified as a. denitrificans; 7 strains of flavobacterium, including f. multovorum (3) and flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of acinetobacter, including a. lwoffi (7) and a. anitratus (2). among 98 strains of  fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; escherichia (9), e. coli (12), enterobacter liquefaciens (31), ent. cloacae (7), ent. halfnia (8), ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be  ascertained.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == severe gram-negative infections in neutropenic children cured by imipenem/cilastatin in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  == nine severe gram-negative septicaemias in neutropenic (less than 500 neutrophils/mm3) children with neoplastic diseases were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (75 mg/kg/day) in combination with an aminoglycoside. the bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa 7, p. putida 1, enterobacter cloacae 1) were resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins, or were isolated during treatment with a broad-spectrum penicillin to which the bacterial strain was sensitive in vitro. the mean duration of neutropenia was 18.5 (3-51) days and duration of treatment 20 (8-51) days. pyrexia was controlled in 2.8 (1-10) days and eradication of the pathogen from blood in one day. no clinical and biological adverse reaction was observed. these results show imipenem/cilastatin to be an effective treatment of infections in severely immunocompromised patients.
