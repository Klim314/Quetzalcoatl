TI  == acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid psma198 by streptococcus  macedonicus aca-dc 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  == background: streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to streptococcus thermophilus. however, s. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex. methodology/principal findings: we analyzed the psma198 plasmid  isolated from the dairy strain streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. psma198 belongs to the narrow host range pci305/pwv02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. comparative analysis of the psma198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from lactococcus lactis strains  deriving from milk or its products. phylogenetic analysis of the psma198 rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. additionally, cloning of the psma198 ori in l. lactis revealed a  100% stability of replication over 100 generations. both psma198 and the chromosome of s. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes,  indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. we identified chromosomal regions in s. macedonicus that may have originated from psma198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. psma198 was also found in divergent biotypes of s. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. greece and switzerland) showing that psma198's acquisition is not a recent event. conclusions/significance: here we propose that s. macedonicus acquired plasmid psma198 from l. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. we provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == characterization of a new camp factor carried by an integrative and conjugative element in streptococcus agalactiae and spreading in streptococci.
AB  == genetic exchanges between streptococci occur frequently and contribute to their genome diversification. most of sequenced streptococcal genomes carry multiple mobile genetic elements including integrative and conjugative elements (ices) that play a major role in these horizontal gene transfers. in addition to genes involved in their mobility and regulation, ices also carry genes that can confer  selective advantages to bacteria. numerous elements have been described in s. agalactiae especially those integrated at the 3' end of a trna(lys) encoding gene. in strain 515 of s. agalactiae, an invasive neonate human pathogen, the ice (called 515_trna(lys)) is functional and carries different putative virulence genes including one encoding a putative new camp factor in addition to the one previously described. this work demonstrated the functionality of this camp factor (camp factor ii) in lactococcus lactis but also in pathogenic strains of veterinary origin. the search for co-hemolytic factors in a collection of field strains revealed their presence in s. uberis, s. dysgalactiae, but also for the first time in s. equisimilis and s. bovis. sequencing of these genes revealed the prevalence of a species-specific factor in s. uberis strains (uberis factor) and  the presence of a camp factor ii encoding gene in s. bovis and s. equisimilis. furthermore, most of the camp factor ii positive strains also carried an element  integrated in the trna(lys) gene. this work thus describes a camp factor that is  carried by a mobile genetic element and has spread to different streptococcal species.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(s/m) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the presence of antibiotic-resistance (ar) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic  pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. we have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne  isolates of s. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. the gene was identified as a novel tet(s/m) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the  n-terminal 33 amino acids of tet(s), in-frame with the tet(m) coding sequence. heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer tet resistance upon escherichia coli recipients. moreover, the tet(s/m) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by tet under the endogenous tet(s) promoter in both s. bovis and e. coli. nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of  16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of streptococcus infantarius and lactococcus lactis. a subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(s/m) was flanked by two copies of the is1216 mobile element. pcr amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(s/m) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two is1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. the circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pk214 from lc. lactis, containing tet(s), as well as the is1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred  within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.

TI  == reidentification of streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == gene cluster for biosynthesis of thermophilin 1277--a lantibiotic produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277, and heterologous expression of tepi, a novel  immunity peptide.
AB  == aims: to identify genes cluster for thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277. methods and results: to identify genes for thermophilin 1277 production, the chromosomal dna region surrounding the structural gene, tepa, was sequenced using a primer-walking method. the thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis gene locus (tep) is a 9.9-kb region, which consists of at least ten  open reading frames (orfs) in the following order: tepamtfegkri and orf4. homology analysis showed high similarity to genes involved in bovicin hj50 production by streptococcus bovis hj50. tepi encodes a novel, small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 52 amino acids, which contains a putative transmembrane segment. by heterologous expression in lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris mg1363, the tepi-expressing strain exhibited at least 1.3 times higher resistance to thermophilin 1277. conclusions: thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis genes were encoded by a 9.9-kbp region containing at least ten orfs. tepi is a novel immunity peptide, which protected strep. thermophilus sbt1277 against thermophilin 1277 in addition to tepfeg, a putative abc transporter. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report regarding a lantibiotic gene cluster produced by strep. thermophilus strain.

TI  == identification of tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant gram-positive cocci within the fermenting microflora of an italian dairy food product.
AB  == aims: microbiological and molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance in gram-positive cocci derived from the italian pdo (protected designation of origin) dairy food product mozzarella di bufala campana. methods and results: one hundred and seven coccal colonies were assigned to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus bovis genera by ardra analysis (amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis). among them, 16 ent. faecalis, 26 l. lactis and 39 strep. bovis displayed high minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values  for tetracycline, while 17 l. lactis showed high mic values for both tetracycline and erythromycin. strain typing and molecular analysis of the phenotypically resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of the tet(m) gene in the tetracycline-resistant strains and of tet(s) and erm(b) in the double-resistant strains. southern blot analysis revealed plasmid localization of l. lactis tet(m), as well as of the erm(b) and tet(s) genes. genetic linkage of erm(b) and  tet(s) was also demonstrated by pcr amplification. conjugation experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer to ent. faecalis strain jh2-2 only for the plasmid-borne l. lactis tet(m) gene. conclusions: we characterized tetracycline-and erythromycin-resistance genes in coccal species, representing the fermenting microflora of a typical italian dairy product. significance and impact of the study: these results are of particular relevance from the food safety viewpoint, especially in the light of the potential risk of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes among foodborne commensal bacteria.

TI  == production of bacteriocins by streptococcus bovis strains from australian ruminants.
AB  == aims: to examine the prevalence of bacteriocin production in streptococcus bovis  isolates from australian ruminants and the feasibility of industrial production of bacteriocin. methods and results: streptococcus bovis strains were tested for  production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by antagonism assay against lactococcus lactis. blis production was associated with source animal location (i.e. proximity of other bacteriocin-positive source animals) rather than ruminant species/breed or diet. one bacteriocin showing strong inhibitory activity (sb15) was isolated and examined. protein sequence, stability and activity spectrum of this bovicin were very similar to bovicin hc5. production could be increased through serial culturing, and increased productivity could be  partially maintained during cold storage of cultures. conclusions: blis production is geographically widely distributed in eastern australia, and it appears that the bacteriocin(+) trait is maintained in animals at the same location. the hc5-like bacteriocin, originally identified in north america, is also found in australia. production of bacteriocin can be increased through serial culturing. significance and impact of the study: the hc5-like bacteriocins appear to have a broad global distribution. serial culturing may provide a route  towards commercial manufacturing for use in industrial applications, and purified bacteriocin from s. bovis sb15 could potentially be used to prevent food spoilage or as a feed additive to promote growth in ruminant species.

TI  == characteristics of the bovicin hj50 gene cluster in streptococcus bovis hj50.
AB  == bovicin hj50 is a new lantibiotic containing a disulfide bridge produced by streptococcus bovis hj50; its encoding gene bova was reported in our previous publication. to identify other genes involved in bovicin hj50 production, dna fragments flanking bova were cloned and sequenced. the bovicin hj50 biosynthesis  gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal dna and consisted of at  least nine genes in the following order: bova, -m, -t, -e, -f, orf1, orf2, bovk and bovr. a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase gene named sdb1 was located downstream of bovr. a knockout mutant of this gene retained antimicrobial activity and the molecular mass of bovicin hj50 in the mutant was the same as that of bovicin hj50 in s. bovis hj50, implying that sdb1 is not involved in bovicin hj50 production.  transcriptional analyses showed that bova, bovm and bovt constituted an operon, and the transcription start site of the bova promoter was located at a g residue  45 bp upstream of the translation start codon for bova, while bove through bovr were transcribed together and the transcription start site of the bove promoter was located at a c residue 35 bp upstream of bove. we also demonstrated successful heterologous expression of bovicin hj50 in lactococcus lactis mg1363,  which lacks thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes; this showed that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes other than sdb1 are not essential for bovicin hj50 biosynthesis.

TI  == new strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (sbd) of the *-amylase of streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in escherichia  coli. the fusion protein (cph-sbd) was able to bind to the cell surface of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441 and to corn starch. therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. at a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of l. casei did not form any  aggregates with corn starch. after incubation in simulated gastric juice (ph 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. when cph-sbd-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. the survival of the amylose-coated cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of cph-sbd-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. these  results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.

TI  == bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == with the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (labs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis il1403 was studied. cph fused to the alpha-amylase (amy) of streptococcus bovis 148 either at its c-terminus (cph-amy) or at its n-terminus (amy-cph) was expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli. this domain was able to direct binding of amy to the surface of l. lactis atcc 19435 in both constructs. however, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of cph-amy were 3 and 14 times greater  than those in the case of amy-cph, respectively. of the labs tested, l. lactis atcc 19435 showed the highest binding capability for cph-amy, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). the binding of cph-amy to the surface of lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). the production of cph-amy in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. the results of this study suggest the usefulness of cph as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in e. coli. furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of cph in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.

TI  == system using tandem repeats of the ca peptidoglycan-binding domain from lactococcus lactis for display of both n- and c-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the c terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (ca domain) of acma (a major autolysin from lactococcus lactis). western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (ca-amya) of the ca domain and alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of l. lactis cells. amya was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. moreover, with an increase in the number of ca domains, the quantity of ca-amya fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. when three repeats of the ca domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. the raw starch-degrading activity of amya was significantly higher when amya was fused to the c terminus of the ca domain than when it was fused to the n terminus. in addition, ca-amya fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei.

TI  == improvement in lactic acid production from starch using alpha-amylase-secreting lactococcus lactis cells adapted to maltose or starch.
AB  == to achieve direct and efficient lactic acid production from starch, a genetically modified lactococcus lactis il 1403 secreting alpha-amylase, which was obtained from streptococcus bovis 148, was constructed. using this strain, the fermentation of soluble starch was achieved, although its rate was far from efficient (0.09 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that maltose accumulated during fermentation, and this was thought to lead to inefficient fermentation. to accelerate maltose consumption, starch fermentation was examined using l. lactis cells adapted to maltose instead of glucose. this led to a decrease in the amount of maltose accumulation in the culture, and, as a result, a more rapid fermentation was accomplished (1.31 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). maximum volumetric lactate productivity was further increased (1.57 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate) using cells adapted to starch, and a high  yield of lactate (0.89 g of lactate per gram of consumed sugar) of high optical purity (99.2% of l: -lactate) was achieved. in this study, we propose a new approach to lactate production by alpha-amylase-secreting l. lactis that allows efficient fermentation from starch using cells adapted to maltose or starch before fermentation.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == microbial and physiological characterization of weakly amylolytic but fast-growing lactic acid bacteria: a functional role in supporting microbial diversity in pozol, a mexican fermented maize beverage.
AB  == pozol is an acid beverage obtained from the natural fermentation of nixtamal (heat- and alkali-treated maize) dough. the concentration of mono- and disaccharides from maize is reduced during nixtamalization, so that starch is the main carbohydrate available for lactic acid fermentation. in order to provide some basis to understand the role of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (alab) in this fermented food, their diversity and physiological characteristics were determined. forty amylolytic strains were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. four different biotypes were distinguished via ribotyping; streptococcus bovis strains were found to be predominant. streptococcus macedonicus, lactococcus lactis, and enterococcus sulfureus strains were also identified. s. bovis strain 25124 showed extremely low amylase yield relative to biomass (139 u g [cell dry weight](-1)) and specific rate of amylase  production (130.7 u g [cell dry weight](-1) h(-1)). in contrast, it showed a high specific growth rate (0.94 h(-1)) and an efficient energy conversion yield to bacterial cell biomass (0.31 g of biomass g of substrate(-1)). these would confer on the strain a competitive advantage and are the possible reasons for its dominance. transient accumulation of maltooligosaccharides during fermentation could presumably serve as energy sources for nonamylolytic species in pozol fermentation. this would explain the observed diversity and the dominance of nonamylolytic lactic acid bacteria at the end of fermentation. these results are  the first step to understanding the importance of alab during pozol fermentation.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

AB  == malic enzyme (ec 1.1.1.39), which catalyzes l-malate oxidative decarboxylation and pyruvate reductive carboxylation, was purified to homogeneity from streptococcus bovis atcc 15352, and properties of this enzyme were determined. the 2.9-kb fragment containing the malic enzyme gene was cloned, and the sequence was determined and analyzed. the enzymatic properties of the s. bovis malic enzyme were almost identical to those of other malic enzymes previously reported. however, we found that the s. bovis malic enzyme catalyzed unknown enzymatic reactions, including reduction of 2-oxoisovalerate, reduction of 2-oxoisocaproate, oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisovalerate, and oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisocaproate. the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of these unique activities were different from the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of the l-malate oxidative decarboxylating activity. a sequence analysis of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames that were 1,299  and 1,170 nucleotides long. the 389-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from the 1,170-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the malic enzyme; this enzyme exhibited high levels of similarity to malic enzymes of bacillus stearothermophilus and haemophilus influenzae and was also similar to other malic enzymes and the malolactic enzyme of lactococcus lactis.

TI  == detection and localization of peptidases in lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == llaai and llabi, two type-ii restriction endonucleases from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w9 and w56 recognizing, respectively, 5'-/gatc-3' and 5'-c/tryag-3'.
AB  == two type-ii restriction endonucleases have been purified from lactococcus lactis  subsp. cremoris w9 and w56, the strains isolated from a mixed cheddar starter. their characterization showed that llaai was an isoschizomer of mboi from morexella bovis with the cleaving sequence, 5'/gatc-3', being sensitive to methylation of the adenine residue; llabi was an isoschizomer to sfci from streptococcus faceium with the cleaving sequence, 5'-c/tryag-3'. both llaai and llabi restriction-modification (r-m) systems are encoded by the plasmids, respectively, pfw094 and pjw563, protecting the harboring strain against phage attack.

TI  == characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic dna.
AB  == a restriction enzyme analysis (rea) of chromosomal dna for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. the dna was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme sal i to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. one hundred and  eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated british antarctic survey base. the epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. this technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and e. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. a sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 s ribosomal rna from escherichia coli. discrimination between isolates was poorer than with rea, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.

TI  == the phylogenetic position of streptococcus and enterococcus.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, s. equinus, s. bovis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. rattus, s. cricetus, s. lactis, s. raffinolactis and enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16s ribosomal rna. all the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the brochothrix and listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'clostridium' branch of gram-positive eubacteria. within the steptococcus-enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
