TI  - Metagenomics reveals diversity and abundance of meta-cleavage pathways in microbial communities from soil highly contaminated with jet fuel under air-sparging bioremediation.
AB  - The extradiol dioxygenase diversity of a site highly contaminated with aliphatic  and aromatic hydrocarbons under air-sparging treatment was assessed by functional screening of a fosmid library in Escherichia coli with catechol as substrate. The 235 positive clones from inserts of DNA extracted from contaminated soil were equivalent to one extradiol dioxygenase-encoding gene per 3.6 Mb of DNA screened, indicating a strong selection for genes encoding this function. Three subfamilies were identified as being predominant, with 72, 55 and 43 fosmid inserts carrying genes, related to those encoding TbuE of Ralstonia pickettii PK01 (EXDO-D), IpbC of Pseudomonas sp. JR1 (EXDO-K2) or DbtC of Burkholderia sp. DBT1 (EXDO-Dbt), respectively, whereas genes encoding enzymes related to XylE of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 were not observed. Genes encoding oxygenases related to isopropylbenzene dioxygenases were usually colocalized with genes encoding EXDO-K2 dioxygenases. Functional analysis of representative proteins indicated a subcluster of EXDO-D proteins to show exceptional high affinity towards different catecholic substrates. Based on V(max)/K(m) specificity constants, a task-sharing between different extradiol dioxygenases in the community of the contaminated site can be supposed, attaining a complementary and community-balanced catalytic power against diverse catecholic derivatives, as necessary for effective degradation of mixtures of aromatics.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analyses of chlorobenzene degradation gene clusters in Pandoraea sp. strain MCB032.
AB  - Pandoraea sp. strain MCB032 was isolated as an emerging chlorobenzene degrader from a functionally stable bioreactor where species succession had occurred. In this study, two gene clusters encoding chlorobenzene metabolic functions have been cloned. Within the cbs gene cluster, CbsA and CbsB are similar to the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in Ralstonia sp. JS705 and shown to transform chlorobenzene to 3-chlorocatechol. The clc gene cluster shows strong similarity to the clc genes of Ralstonia sp. JS705 and encodes chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (ClcA) and other enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of chlorocatechol to 3-oxoadipate. The Michaelis constants (K (m)) values of ClcA for catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 3-chlorocatechol were determined as 10.0, 8.9 and 3.4 muM, respectively. CbsX, a putative transport protein present in the cbs cluster of strain MCB032 but not in those of other chlorobenzene degraders, shows 76 and 53% identities to two previously identified transport proteins involved in toluene degradation, TbuX from Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and TodX from Pseudomonas putida F1. The presence of the transport protein in strain MCB032 likely provides a mechanistic explanation for its higher chlorobenzene affinity and may well be the basis for the competitive advantage of this strain in the bioreactor.
TI  - Outer-membrane transport of aromatic hydrocarbons as a first step in biodegradation.
AB  - Bacterial biodegradation of hydrocarbons, an important process for environmental  remediation, requires the passage of hydrophobic substrates across the cell membrane. Here, we report crystal structures of two outer membrane proteins, Pseudomonas putida TodX and Ralstonia pickettii TbuX, which have been implicated in hydrocarbon transport and are part of a subfamily of the FadL fatty acid transporter family. The structures of TodX and TbuX show significant differences with those previously determined for Escherichia coli FadL, which may provide an explanation for the substrate-specific transport of TodX and TbuX observed with in vivo transport assays. The TodX and TbuX structures revealed 14-stranded beta-barrels with an N-terminal hatch domain blocking the barrel interior. A hydrophobic channel with bound detergent molecules extends from the extracellular surface and is contiguous with a passageway through the hatch domain, lined by both hydrophobic and polar or charged residues. The TodX and TbuX structures support a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic substrates from the extracellular environment to the periplasm via a channel through the hatch domain.
TI  - Degradation of toluene by a mixed population of archetypal aerobes, microaerophiles, and denitrifiers: laboratory sand column experiment and multispecies biofilm model formulation.
AB  - An experiment was conducted in a saturated sand column with three bacterial strains that have different growth characteristics on toluene, Pseudomonas putida F1 which degrades toluene only under aerobic conditions, Thauera aromatica T1 which degrades toluene only under denitrifying conditions, and Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 has a facultative nature and can perform nitrate-enhanced biodegradation of toluene under hypoxic conditions (DO <2 mg/L). Steady-state concentration profiles showed that oxygen and nitrate appeared to be utilized simultaneously, regardless of the dissolved oxygen concentration and the results from fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that PKO1 maintained stable cells numbers throughout the column, even when the pore water oxygen concentration was high. Since PKO1's growth rate under aerobic condition is much lower than that of F1, except under hypoxic conditions, these observations were not anticipated. Therefore these observations require a mechanistic explanation that can account for localized low oxygen concentrations under aerobic conditions. To simulate the observed dynamics, a multispecies biofilm model was implemented. This model formulation assumes the formation of a thin biofilm that is composed of the three bacterial strains. The individual strains grow in response to the substrate and electron acceptor flux from bulk fluid into the biofilm. The model was implemented such that internal changes in bacterial composition and substrate concentration can be simulated over time and space. The model simulations from oxic to denitrifying conditions compared well to the experimental profiles of the chemical species and the bacterial strains, indicating the importance of accounting for the biological activity of individual strains in biofilms that span different redox conditions.
TI  - Spatial distribution and physiological state of bacteria in a sand column experiment during the biodegradation of toluene.
AB  - Toxic organic contaminants frequently serve as growth substrates for bacteria. However, long-term exposure to the organic contaminants can result in significant stress or "injury" to bacterial cells such that bacteria may lose, either temporarily or permanently, their capacity to degrade a specific toxic organic contaminant. In order to understand the relationship between biodegradability and physiological conditions of bacteria after a prolonged exposure to a contaminant, biomass samples collected from a sand column experiment, with toluene as the carbon source, were analyzed for bacterial physiology and spatial population distribution in the porous media. The column was seeded with three bacterial isolates that perform aerobic (Pseudomonas putida F1), denitrifying (Thauera aromatica T1), and facultative (Ralstonia pickettii PKO1) degradation of toluene were analyzed. Total, viable but not culturable with toluene, and toluene-culturable cells were enumerated using 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and plate counting methods. Comparison of three types of cell counts showed that toluene-culturable cells were less than 40% of the total cell numbers. However, viable colonies transferred to a toluene media after cultivation on rich media regained their ability to degrade toluene. This implies that the temporary loss of their toluene degradation capacity is either due to an intracellular accumulation of degradation by-products, which have to be consumed in order for the cells to degrade toluene, or it is possible that cells have shifted to degrade other substrates such as toluene degradation intermediates or organic materials resulting from cell turnover. Comparison of cell counts with toluene concentration showed no exponential increase in total and viable cell numbers, as reported for flat bed biofilm reactor experiments. The overall fraction of toluene-culturable cells was highest at the highest toluene concentration near the column inlet, which indicates that the observed temporary loss of toluene culturability was not solely caused by a direct toxic effect from the long-term exposure to toluene.
TI  - Kinetics of 1,4-dioxane biodegradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria.
AB  - 1,4-Dioxane is a probable human carcinogen, and an important emerging water contaminant. In this study, the biodegradation of dioxane by 20 bacterial isolates was evaluated, and 13 were found to be capable of transforming dioxane. Dioxane served as a growth substrate for Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 and Pseudonocardia benzenivorans B5, with yields of 0.09 g protein g dioxane(-1) and 0.03 g protein g dioxane(-1), respectively. Cometabolic transformation of dioxane was observed for monooxygenase-expressing strains that were induced with methane, propane, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene including Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5, Pseudonocardia K1, Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, Burkholderia cepacia G4, and Rhodococcus RR1. Product toxicity resulted in incomplete dioxane degradation for many of the cometabolic reactions. Brief exposure to acetylene, a known monooxygenase inhibitor, prevented oxidation of dioxane in all cases, supporting the hypothesis that monooxygenase enzymes participated in the transformation of dioxane by these strains. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene-2- and toluene-4-monooxygenases of G4, KR1 and PKO1 were also capable of cometabolic dioxane transformation. Dioxane oxidation rates measured at 50 mg/L ranged from 0.01 to 0.19 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the metabolic processes, 0.1-0.38 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for cometabolism by the monooxygenase-induced strains, and 0.17-0.60 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the recombinant strains. Dioxane was not degraded by M. trichosporium OB3b expressing particulate methane monooxygenase, Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing a toluene side-chain monooxygenase, and PseudomonasJS150 and Pseudomonas putida F1 expressing toluene-2,3-dioxygenases. This is the first study to definitively show the role of monooxygenases in dioxane degradation using several independent lines of evidence and to describe the kinetics of metabolic and cometabolic dioxane degradation.
TI  - Evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting Gram-negative rods.
AB  - To evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (NFGNR), 293 isolates were tested. A 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. From this a 108-109 cfu/mL suspension was added to 0.25 mL of sterile physiologic solution. A PYR disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at 35-37 degrees C, at environmental atmosphere. Reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. Strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bergeyella zoohelcum, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella hinzii, Brevundimonas diminuta, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Brucella ovis, Brucella spp., Brucella suis, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella nonliquefaciens, Moraxella osloensis, Oligella ureolytica, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas Vb3, Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were PYR negative. On the other hand Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter denitrificans, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia gladioli, Chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, Comamonas testosroni, Cupriavidus pauculus, Delftia acidovorans, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Myroides spp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Ralstonia pickettii, Rhizobium radiobacter, Shewanella spp., Sphingobacterium multivorum, Sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and Weeksella virosa were PYR positive. Finally, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Roseomonas spp., and Sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were PYR variable. PYR testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of NFGNR.
TI  - Aerobic biodegradation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by axenic bacterial strains.
AB  - The water contaminant N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen whose appearance in the environment is related to the release of rocket fuel and to chlorine-based disinfection of water and wastewater. Although this compound has been shown to be biodegradable, there is minimal information about the organisms capable of this degradation, and little is understood of the mechanisms or biochemistry involved. This study shows that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes functionally similar to those demonstrated to degrade NDMA in eukaryotes have the capability to degrade NDMA. Specifically, induction of the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) expressed by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, the propane monooxygenase (PMO) enzyme of Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5, and the toluene 4-monooxygenases found in Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 resulted in NDMA degradation by these strains. In each of these cases, brief exposure to acetylene gas, a suicide substrate for certain monooxygenases, inhibited the degradation of NDMA. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene monooxygenases found in strains PKO1 and KR1 mimicked the behavior of the parent strains. In contrast, M. trichosporium OB3b expressing the particulate form of MMO, Burkholderia cepacia G4 expressing the toluene 2-monooxygenase, and Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing the toluene sidechain monooxygenase were not capable of NDMA degradation. In addition, bacteria expressing aromatic dioxygenases were not capable of NDMA degradation. Finally, Rhodococcus sp. RR1 exhibited the ability to degrade NDMA by an unidentified, constitutively expressed enzyme that, unlike the confirmed monooxygenases, was not inhibited by acetylene exposure.
TI  - Trichloroethylene degradation by toluene-oxidizing bacteria grown on non-aromatic substrates.
AB  - The potential of trichloroethylene (TCE) to induce and non-aromatic growth substrates to support TCE degradation in five strains (Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, Pseudomonas putida F1, Burkholderia cepacia G4, B. cepacia PR1) of toluene-oxidizing bacteria was examined. LB broth and acetate did not support TCE degradation in any of the wild-type strains. In contrast, fructose supported the highest specific levels of TCE oxidation observed in each of the strains tested, except B. cepacia G4. We discuss the potential mechanisms and implications of this observation. In particular, cells of P. mendocina KR1 degraded significant amounts of TCE during cell growth on non-aromatic substrates. Apparently, TCE degradation was not completely constrained by any given factor in this microorganism, as was observed with P. putida F1 (TCE was an extremely poor substrate) or B. cepacia G4 (lack of oxygenase induction by TCE). Our results indicate that multiple physiological traits are required to enable useful TCE degradation by toluene-oxidizing bacteria in the absence of aromatic cosubstrates. These traits include oxygenase induction, effective TCE turnover, and some level of resistance to TCE mediated toxicity.
TI  - Effect of temperature and dissolved oxygen on the growth kinetics of Pseudomonas  putida F1 growing on benzene and toluene.
AB  - Batch experiments were conducted to determine the effect of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration on the rates of growth and substrate (benzene and toluene) degradation by the toluene degrading strain, Pseudomonas putida F1. Over a range of temperature from 15 to 35 degrees C the maximum specific growth rate followed the Topiwala-Sinclair relationship when either benzene or toluene served as the sole carbon and energy source. Oxygen limited growth followed Monod saturation kinetics with the specific growth rate given as a function of the dissolved oxygen concentration. The oxygen half-saturation coefficient was found to be approximately 1 mg/l regardless of whether benzene or toluene was the substrate. Similar experiments with Burkholderia (Ralstonia) pickettii PKO1 for grown on toluene revealed an oxygen half-saturation coefficient of 0.7 mg/l.
TI  - Substrate inhibition kinetics for toluene and benzene degrading pure cultures and a method for collection and analysis of respirometric data for strongly inhibited cultures.
AB  - We present an evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative effects that high concentrations of benzene and toluene have on the growth rate of several pure cultures that use these compounds as their sole carbon and energy source. The cultures employed were five widely studied environmental isolates: Pseudomonas putida F1, P. putida mt2, P. mendocina KR, Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, and Burkholderia cepacia G4. Three cultures degraded toluene following a pattern consistent with the kinetic model of Wayman and Tseng (1976) while the other two followed a modification of this model introduced by Alagappan and Cowan (2001). The pattern followed for benzene degradation was different than that for toluene degradation for all four capable pure cultures and consistent with that described by the model of Luong (1987). Mechanisms of substrate inhibition and solvent toxicity are discussed, used to conceptually evaluate the reasons for the differences in inhibition behavior, and used to support a call for more widespread use of the empirical, terminal substrate concentration inhibition models employed here. We also present the methodology developed to overcome a limitation commonly encountered when attempting to collect oxygen uptake data for use in quantifying substrate inhibition kinetics. The experimental method was effective for use in the collection of high quality data and the substrate inhibition models most useful in representing the growth of bacteria on these solvents are those that show a complete loss of activity at high concentration rather than the more popular asymptotic inhibition models.
TI  - Degradation of mixtures of aromatic and chloroaliphatic hydrocarbons by aromatic  hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria.
AB  - The well-characterized toluene-oxidizing bacteria Pseudomonas putida PaW1, P. putida F1, P. mendocina KR1, Burkholderia cepacia G4, B. cepacia JS150, and Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, as well as several strains of bacteria isolated from activated sludge, were examined for their ability to degrade mixtures of aromatic and chloroaliphatic hydrocarbons. Collectively, the strains tested were able to transform all of the 14 aromatic hydrocarbons included in the mixtures, with most strains degrading five or more. Few strains degraded trichloroethylene well under these conditions, only one degraded methylene chloride, and none were able to transform chloroform. G4, PKO1, KR1, F1, and JS150 exhibited generally broad but oxygenase-specific degradation profiles, with the three monooxygenase strains degrading significantly more o-xylene and trichloroethylene, and F1 and JS150 degrading greater quantities of isopropylbenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. PaW1 degraded only the methylaromatic hydrocarbons and styrene. Sludge isolates enriched on benzene, toluene, styrene and the xylenes exhibited degradation profiles similar to F1 or PaW1, while the pattern of hydrocarbon degradation for the ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, and 1,3-dichlorobenzene isolates were distinct from the other strains and from each other. Overall, our results showed that many of the bacteria which utilize aromatic compounds are capable of degrading a diverse array of aromatic hydrocarbons in mixtures, but that chloroaliphatics such as methylene chloride and chloroform may be recalcitrant to co-oxidation in the presence of aromatics or trichloroethylene.
TI  - Carbon and hydrogen stable isotope fractionation during aerobic bacterial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons.
AB  - 13C/(12)C and D/H stable isotope fractionation during aerobic degradation was determined for Pseudomonas putida strain mt-2, Pseudomonas putida strain F1, Ralstonia pickettii strain PKO1, and Pseudomonas putida strain NCIB 9816 grown with toluene, xylenes, and naphthalene. Different types of initial reactions used by the respective bacterial strains could be linked with certain extents of stable isotope fractionation during substrate degradation.
TI  - Toluene-degrading bacteria are chemotactic towards the environmental pollutants benzene, toluene, and trichloroethylene.
AB  - The bioremediation of polluted groundwater and toxic waste sites requires that bacteria come into close physical contact with pollutants. This can be accomplished by chemotaxis. Five motile strains of bacteria that use five different pathways to degrade toluene were tested for their ability to detect and swim towards this pollutant. Three of the five strains (Pseudomonas putida F1, Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, and Burkholderia cepacia G4) were attracted to toluene. In each case, the response was dependent on induction by growth with toluene. Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 and P. putida PaW15 did not show a convincing response. The chemotactic responses of P. putida F1 to a variety of toxic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated aliphatic compounds were examined. Compounds that are growth substrates for P. putida F1, including benzene and ethylbenzene, were chemoattractants. P. putida F1 was also attracted to trichloroethylene (TCE), which is not a growth substrate but is dechlorinated and detoxified by P. putida F1. Mutant strains of P. putida F1 that do not oxidize toluene were attracted to toluene, indicating that toluene itself and not a metabolite was the compound detected. The two-component response regulator pair TodS and TodT, which control expression of the toluene degradation genes in P. putida F1, were required for the response. This demonstration that soil bacteria can sense and swim towards the toxic compounds toluene, benzene, TCE, and related chemicals suggests that the introduction of chemotactic bacteria into selected polluted sites may accelerate bioremediation processes.
TI  - Outbreak of Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteremia among oncology patients.
AB  - From 7 to 24 March 1997, four patients developed Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteremia at the hospital; one on the oncology ward and the other three in the chemotherapy room. These patients all had underlying malignancies and had the Port-A-Cath (Smiths Industries Medical Systems, Deltec, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) implants. Three patients had primary bacteremia, and one had Port-A-Cath-related infection. None of these patients had received a blood transfusion before the episodes of bacteremia. All patients recovered: two received antimicrobial agents with in vitro activity against the isolates, and the other two did not have any antibiotic treatment. A total of eight blood isolates were recovered from these patients during the febrile episodes that occurred several minutes after the infusion of chemotherapeutic agents via the Port-A-Cath. These isolates were initially identified as P. fluorescens or Pseudomonas putida (four), Burkholderia (Ralstonia) pickettii (three), and a non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacillus (one) by routine biochemical methods and the Vitek GNI card. These isolates were later identified as P. fluorescens on the basis of the characteristic cellular fatty acid chromatogram and the results of supplemental biochemical tests. The identification of identical antibiotypes by the E test and the random amplified polymorphic DNA patterns generated by arbitrarily primed PCR of the isolates showed that the outbreak was caused by a single clone of P. fluorescens. Surveillance cultures of the possibly contaminated infusion fluids and disinfectants, which were performed 7 days after recognition of the last infected patient, failed to isolate P. fluorescens. This report of a small outbreak caused by P. fluorescens suggests that timely, accurate identification of unusual nosocomial pathogens is crucial for early initiation of an epidemiological investigation and timely control of an outbreak.
