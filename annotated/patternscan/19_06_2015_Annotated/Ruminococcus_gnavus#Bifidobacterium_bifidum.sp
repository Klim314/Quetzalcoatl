TI  == comparison of the compositions of the stool microbiotas of infants fed goat milk  formula, cow milk-based formula, or breast milk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.

TI  == enhancing effects of bile salts on the degradation of glycosphingolipids by glycosidases from bacteria of the human fecal flora.
AB  == different concentrations of ionic and non-ionic detergents were examined for optimization of the in vitro degradations of intestinal glycosphingolipids by alpha- and beta-glycosidases from human fecal bacteria. in 5 mm triton x-100 the  enzymes hydrolyzed glycosphingolipids with lactoseries type 1 and 2 chains essentially to lactosylceramide (laccer). in 5 mm sodium di- and trihydroxy bile  salts lactosylceramide was degraded to glycosylceramide (glccer) in varying extent by enzymes from all five strains. the minimal bile salt concentrations for optimal 1,4-beta-galactosidase activities varied between 1 and 20 mm, i.e., close to or above the critical micellar concentrations (cmc). dihydroxy bile salts were the most efficient in promoting conversion of laccer to glccer at concentrations  below 10 mm and conjugation with a taurine residue did not markedly lower the glccer yield. the optimal detergent concentrations for hydrolyses of the p-nitrophenyl (pnp) glycosides gal beta 1-pnp and galnac alpha 1-pnp were approximately 0.05 mm for triton x-100 and 0.5 mm for sodium taurodeoxycholate, i.e., clearly below their reported cmc values. galabiosylceramide, globotria- and globotetraosylceramides, not degraded in the triton x-100 micelles, were also resistant to hydrolysis using the sodium bile salts as detergents. in contrast, lactotetraosylceramide and isoglobotriaosylceramide were significantly more degraded by enzymes from a ruminococcus gnavus strain and gangliotetraosylceramide by enzymes from a bifidobacterium bifidum and a bifidobacterium infantis strain using bile salt detergents. all strains but r. gnavus released terminal galnac from para-forssman but not from the globotetraosylceramide or forssman structures using 5 mm sodium deoxycholate as detergent. gm1 desialylation by two ruminococcus torques strains and the r. gnavus and b. bifidum strains were enhanced under identical conditions. we conclude that the observed effects on glycosphingolipid hydrolyses reflects variations in the micellar presentation of the substrates. in addition, detergents seem to have a direct stimulating effect on the glycosidases, however  at concentrations 10-100-times below the ones optimal for glycolipid degradations. these results with optimized bile salt concentrations, further support our previous observations that these five fecal bacterial strains produce enzymes with selected specificities towards glycosphingolipid core chains of the  lactoseries type 1 and 2.
