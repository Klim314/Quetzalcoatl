TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  == background and aims: altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. we investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. methods: a colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to  the abdominal wall through two colostomies. the loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop  was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. results: colonisation with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. colonisation with lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. conclusions: certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.

TI  == study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in gizan region, saudi arabia.
AB  == traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, bayadh and hamra. the bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and  fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees c. two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. the micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). the content of lactic acid was increased  with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). the ph dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third  fermentations, respectively. the microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus brevis, lact. lactis subsp. lactis, lact. cellobiosus, klebsiella oxytoca, kl. pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent. sakazakii, serratia marcescens and ser. odourifera), moulds (penicillium sp., rhizopus sp.,  aspergillus niger, alternaria sp., fusarium sp. and mucor sp.) and yeasts (candida parapsilosis, c. orvegnsis and rhodotorula glutinis).

TI  == microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (colocynthis citrullus l.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  == microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. polymyxa, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, lactobacillus plantarum, la. brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, micrococcus and candida spp. the rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of b. subtilis and b. licheniformis.

TI  == 1,3-propanediol:nad+ oxidoreductases of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == in the cofermentation of glycerol with a sugar by lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri, a 1,3-propanediol:nad+ oxidoreductase provides an additional method of nadh disposal. the enzyme has been purified from both l. brevis b22 and l. buchneri b190 and found to have properties very similar to those reported for the enzyme from klebsiella pneumoniae. the enzymes required mn2+ and are probably octamers with a molecular mass of 350 kda. although not absolutely specific for 1,3-propanediol when tested as dehydrogenases, the enzymes have less than 10% activity with glycerol, ethanol, and 1,2-propanediol.  these properties contrast sharply with those of a protein isolated from another lactobacillus species (l. reuteri) that ferments glycerol with glucose and previously designated a 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase.

TI  == isolation and characterization of microorganisms associated with the traditional  sorghum fermentation for production of sudanese kisra.
AB  == sorghum flour obtained from sudan was mixed with water in a 1:2 (wt/vol) ratio and fermented at 30 degrees c for 24 h. the bacterial populations increased with  fermentation time and reached a plateau at approximately 18 h. at the end of 24 h, sorghum batter ph had dropped from 5.95 to 3.95 and the batter had a lactic acid content of 0.80%. the microbial population during the 24 h of fermentation consisted of bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus confusus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus sp., erwinia ananas, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae), yeasts (candida intermedia and debaryomyces hansenii), and molds (aspergillus sp., penicillium sp., fusarium sp., and rhizopus sp.). p.  pentosaceus was the dominant microorganism at the end of the 24-h fermentation. when three consecutive fermentations using an inoculum from the previous fermentation were carried out, the bacterial population increase plateaued at 9 h. the microbial populations in these fermentations were dominated by p. pentosaceus.

TI  == the microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  == soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees c underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of ph from 6.5 to  4.5. lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter diversus and bacillus brevis, and the yeasts pichia burtonii, candida didensiae and rhodotorula rubra.  fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures  of these isolates showed l. casei, strep. faecium and staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the ph reduction. soybeans were the main source  of microorganisms for the fermentation. boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
