TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  == kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. it is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health  benefits. it has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in  that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. there are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. in this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity  was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, escherichia coli atcc 8739, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028 and bacillus cereus atcc 11778. our  findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. this study illustrates the potential of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus spp. isolated from brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  == twelve lactobacillus isolates from brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. the strains were identified by 16s rdna  sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (7), lb. brevis (2), lb. casei (2) and lb.  parabuchneri (1). all strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. only five strains of lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. all lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge dpph radical. beta-galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 miller units.  inhibition of food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. the lactobacillus strains from brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains lb. brevis sm-b and lb. plantarum  sm-i. both presented high acid tolerance. in addition, lb. brevis sm-b also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and lb. plantarum sm-i was the highest  beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == investigation of antibacterial, acid and bile tolerance properties of lactobacilli isolated from koozeh cheese.
AB  == lactobacillus strains are a major part of the probiotics, microflora of the intestine and of fermented dairy products, and are found in a variety of environments. the aim of this study was to find out the ability of bile and acid  tolerance and antibacterial properties of the twenty eight isolates of three group lactobacilli namely lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus delbruki. for this purpose twenty eight different lactobacillus strains that isolated from koozeh cheese as a traditional cheese were screened. the acid tolerance test was studied under ph 2.0 and 3.0 with 7.5 as control. the cell count for the acid tolerance test was obtained at an interval of 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours respectively and was pour plated on man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) agar to be incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. all cells were selected for bile tolerance test in mrs broth containing bile concentrations of 0% as control and 0.3% as test. then cell counts were enumerated after 24 hours of incubation on mrs agar. results showed twenty seven isolates did not have ability to tolerate acid and bile salts and antimicrobial activity against four indicator bacteria included eshirichia coli, listeria monocytogenesis, bacillus cereus, salmonella entritidis. only one isolate namely lactobacillus casei could tolerate acid and bile salt and had antibacterial activity against of l. monocytogenesis. therefore we can consider this strain as a native probiotic but extra examinations was required.

TI  == antimicrobial prenylated acetophenones from berries of harrisonia abyssinica.
AB  == the ripe berries of harrisonia abyssinica yielded two new prenylated acetophenones, namely 5-(ethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 s-(1' s-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (1) and 5-(2'''-hydroxyethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 s-(1' s-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (2), herein named harronin i and harronin ii, respectively. the compounds were isolated following activity guided fractionation and the structures were determined using 1d, 2d nmr spectroscopic, cd and ms spectrometric techniques. the methanol-dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1 v/v) crude extract exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei. harronin i (1) showed a mic of 5  microg/ml against c. albicans, 6 microg/ml against b. cereus, and more than 20 microg/ml against other tested microorganisms. harronin ii (2) showed much weaker mic values (> 100 microg/ml) against all the tested microorganisms.

TI  == synthesis, sar and antibacterial activity of hybrid chloro, dichloro-phenylthiazolyl-s-triazines.
AB  == a series of hybrid novel chloro (1a-9a) and dichloro (10b-18b) phenylthiazolyl-s-triazine were synthesized and subsequently subjected to their antibacterial activity against three gram positive viz. lactobacillus casei (ncim-2651); bacillus cereus (ncim-2458); staphylococcus aureus (ncim-2120) and three gram negative viz salmonella typhimurium (ncim-2501); escherichia coli (ncim-2065); klebsiella aerogenes (ncim-2098). the sar studies around the lead compound revealed that introduction of electron withdrawing groups and amino (-nh-) and mercapto (-s-) linker bridge seemed more promising towards antibacterial activity. moreover, the virtual molinspiration screenings are in compliance with ghose's rule.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == influence of controlled lactic fermentation on growth and sporulation of bacillus cereus in milk.
AB  == the growth and sporulation of bacillus cereus nvh 45 in a fermentor with controlled ph or simulated ph conditions were investigated. the study was carried out in a fermentor to measure the influence of a rapid and a slow lactic acid production on the inhibition of b. cereus in a controlled environment during the  initial part of fermentation and to observe if other factors than lactic acid influenced the inhibition. in the controlled ph experiments the ph was allowed to decrease to an end ph 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0 either by lactobacillus casei 2756 (a fast  acid producer) or lactobacillus acidophilus ncfb 1748 (a slow acid producer). in  co-cultures of lb. casei 2756 and b. cereus nvh 45, low numbers (10-70 cfu/ml) of b. cereus nvh 45 were observed at end ph 5.5 (72 h) while at ph 5.0 no viable cells (<10 cfu/ml) were detected (48-72 h). b. cereus nvh 45 did not sporulate in co-culture with lb. casei 2756. in co-culture with lb. acidophilus ncfb 1748, b.  cereus nvh 45 sporulated and survived as spores. in these co-cultures b. cereus nvh 45 grew to higher maximum counts (>10(7) cfu/ml) than with lb. casei 2756 (<10(7) cfu/ml). significantly different amounts of lactic acid were observed between the two co-cultures after 7 and 12 h. a rapid decrease of ph appears to prevent b. cereus from sporulating and it seems that it is enough to just reach ph 5.0 rapidly and keep that ph to achieve the desirable inhibition of b. cereus. in the simulated ph experiments b. cereus nvh 45 was inoculated in the fermentor  and the different ph developments from different lab strains were monitored by addition of lactic acid. these experiments showed the same tendency: a fast ph reduction during the initial hours of fermentation, simulating lactococci, resulted in complete inhibition of b. cereus nvh 45 (<10 cfu/ml). however, when simulating the ph development of the two different lactobacillus strains, complete inhibition of b. cereus nvh 45 was not seen. in co-cultures competition  for nutrients with consequences for cell density appears to be important. based on these results it seems that b. cereus must reach a certain density to induce sporulation.

TI  == purification of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == bacteriocins are antibacterial substances of a proteinaceous nature that are produced by different bacterial species. lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce biologically active peptides or protein complexes that display a bactericidal mode of action almost exclusively toward gram-positive bacteria and particularly  toward closely related species. generally they are active against food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. there is an increased tendency to use natural occurring metabolites to prevent the growth of  undesirable flora in foodstuffs. these metabolites could replace the use of chemical additives such as sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrite, nitrate, and others. for instance, bacteriocins produced by lab may be promising for use as bio-preservaties. bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are typically cationic, hydrophobic peptides and differ widely in many characteristics including molecular weight, presence of particular groups of amino acids, pi, net positive  charge, and post-translational modifications of certain amino acids. this heterogeneity within the lab bacteriocins may explain the different procedures for isolation and purification developed so far. the methods most frequently used for isolation, concentration, and purification involve salt precipitation of bacteriocins from culture supernatants, followed by various combinations of gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). in this chapter, a protocol is described that combines several methods used in our laboratory for the purification of two cationic bacteriocins, lactocin 705al and enterocin crl10, produced by lactobacillus casei crl705 and enterococcus mundtii crl10, respectively.

TI  == rapid determination of vitamin b2 secretion by bacteria growing on solid media.
AB  == aims: development of an agar-diffusion assay to measure vitamin b2 in biological  samples and application of the method to determine the amount of vitamin b2 secreted by bacteria. methods and results: a riboflavin-auxotrophic mutant of bacillus cereus was generated by mini-tn10 insertion in the ribd gene. ribd mutant sensitivity to exogenous vitamin b2 was investigated by turbidimetric and  agar-diffusion assays. in turbidimetric assays, the b. cereus mutant displayed a  similar level of sensitivity to vitamin b2 to that of lactobacillus casei atcc 7469, the reference organism used for microbiological vitamin b2 quantification.  however, only the ribd mutant could be used as an indicator organism in agar-diffusion assays. a total of eight probiotic strains, from five different probiotic formulations, were analysed by the ribd mutant-based assay on agar plates in order to determine their ability to secrete vitamin b2 during growth. conclusion: the agar diffusion method with the ribd mutant of b. cereus is highly reproducible, sensitive, rapid, inexpensive, and can be applied to measure the amount of vitamin b2 in different samples. significance and impact of the study:  the method developed in this study appears to be a good candidate for the screening of vitamin b2 secretion by bacteria growing on solid media.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  == occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  == analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium. a close correlation was demonstrated between the content of  n-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. these lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of n-acetylation with acetic anhydride. thus, the occurrence of the n-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. the n-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus arabinosus.
