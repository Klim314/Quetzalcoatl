TI  == comparative evaluation of two commercial multiplex panels for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens by use of clinical stool specimens.
AB  == the detection of pathogens associated with gastrointestinal disease may be important in certain patient populations, such as immunocompromised hosts, the critically ill, or individuals with prolonged disease that is refractory to treatment. in this study, we evaluated two commercially available multiplex panels (the filmarray gastrointestinal [gi] panel [biofire diagnostics, salt lake city, ut] and the luminex xtag gastrointestinal pathogen panel [gpp] [luminex corporation, toronto, canada]) using cary-blair stool samples (n = 500) submitted to our laboratory for routine gi testing (e.g., culture, antigen testing, microscopy, and individual real-time pcr). at the time of this study, the prototype (non-fda-cleared) filmarray gi panel targeted 23 pathogens (14 bacterial, 5 viral, and 4 parasitic), and testing of 200 mul of cary-blair stool  was recommended. in contrast, the luminex gpp assay was fda cleared for the detection of 11 pathogens (7 bacterial, 2 viral, and 2 parasitic), but had the capacity to identify 4 additional pathogens using a research-use-only protocol. importantly, the luminex assay was fda cleared for 100 mul raw stool; however, 100 mul cary-blair stool was tested by the luminex assay in this study. among 230 prospectively collected samples, routine testing was positive for one or more gi  pathogens in 19 (8.3%) samples, compared to 76 (33.0%) by the filmarray and 69 (30.3%) by the luminex assay. clostridium difficile (12.6 to 13.9% prevalence) and norovirus genogroup i (gi)/gii (5.7 to 13.9% prevalence) were two of the pathogens most commonly detected by both assays among prospective samples. sapovirus was also commonly detected (5.7% positive rate) by the filmarray assay. among 270 additional previously characterized samples, both multiplex panels demonstrated high sensitivity (>90%) for the majority of targets, with the exception of several pathogens, notably aeromonas sp. (23.8%) by filmarray and yersinia enterocolitica (48.1%) by the luminex assay. interestingly, the filmarray and luminex panels identified mixed infections in 21.1% and 13.0% of positive prospective samples, respectively, compared to only 8.3% by routine methods.

TI  == added value of multiplex luminex gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xtag(r) gpp) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the luminex gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xtag((r)) gpp) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (ng) i/ii, rotavirus a, clostridium difficile toxin a/b, campylobacter sp., escherichia coli o157, enterotoxigenic e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, salmonella sp., shiga-toxin producing e. coli, shiga-like toxin (stx)1/2, shigella sp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium sp., entamoeba histolytica and giardia sp. in this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during november and december 2011 at our laboratory, using the xtag((r)) gpp assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. this procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time pcr for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. if the clinician did not request the test for an xtag((r)) gpp-positive target, real-time pcr assays were used to confirm xtag((r)) gpp positivity. discrepant results were also tested with real-time pcr assays. a total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xtag((r)) gpp. the xtag((r)) gpp assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11  targets could not be confirmed by real-time pcr. the non-confirmed targets were campylobacter (one sample), salmonella (four samples), shigella (one sample) and  e. histolytica (five samples). the xtag((r)) gpp was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single  molecular test, but for detection of e. histolytica and salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the enniatin b, produced by fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on caco-2 cells.
AB  == the enniatins (ens) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of fusarium sp. the en b was purified from extracts of fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (pdb), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (lc) followed by an analytical lc.  the purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) study. the pure fraction of en b was utilized to determine  the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally  pathogens of the intestinal tract: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enterica, shigella dysenteriae, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. the results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, en b induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms  tested and no significant differences over control were detected when caco-2 cells were exposed to en b, at any of the concentrations used.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == [notification according to the law for protection against infections].
AB  == since january 1st 2001, the law for protection against infections decrees the duty of notification along two tracks, on the one hand by notification of infectious diseases and on the other hand by reporting the pathogens. however, the names of pathogens change due to scientific progress. furthermore, these names include in some cases not only harmful agents of infectious diseases but also inoffensive organisms, i. e. giardia lamblia. there are also problems in the notification of other pathogens such as brucella sp., campylobacter sp., chlamydia psittaci,clostridium botulinum, cryptosporidium parvum, leptospira interrogans, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar agents, norwalk-like viruses, salmonella paratyphi, treponema pallidum, trichinella spiralis and pathogenic serovars of yersinia enterocolitica. finally, the abandonment of notification for glanders, lymphogranuloma venereum, ulcus molle and variola appears to be risky, the reasons being partly unconvincing and  contradictory.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == raw beef, pork and chicken in japan contaminated with salmonella sp., campylobacter sp., yersinia enterocolitica, and clostridium perfringens--a comparative study.
AB  == one hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in shimane prefecture, japan, were examined for the presence of salmonella sp. (sal), campylobacter jejuni (cj), campylobacter coli (cc), yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and clostridium perfringens (cp) from april 1984 to march 1985. a total of 205 isolates of sal (112 strains), cj (64 strains), cc (one strain), ye (7 strains) and cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, cc in 0.8% of pork, ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. these enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially sal and cj. sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, cp  was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and cc from pork and cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. this investigation showed that a second-contamination of sal  and cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. it was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with  plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially sal and cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with ye during the cold months.
