TI  == [vaginal infections in pregnant women at the regional hospital of sokode (togo) in 2010 and 2011].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the major microorganisms causing vaginal infections in pregnant women consulting at the regional hospital of sokode and to assess their sensitivity to antibiotics. materials and methods: this prospective study took place from june 2010 through august 2011 and included 302 pregnant women from whom a sample was taken by a vaginal swab. samples were processed for parasitic, bacterial, and fungal agents, by microscopic examination and culture. results: we isolated 273 germs, alone or  in association in 221 women. these germs were distributed as follows: gardnerella vaginalis (55.31%), candida spp (30.77%), staphylococcus aureus (5.49%), enterobacteriaceae (4.40%), trichomonas vaginalis (3.66%) and mobiluncus spp (0.37%). no streptococcus strain was isolated during the study. over 40% of women had bacterial vaginosis and 23.08% of them were coinfected. the occurrence of coinfection was statistically influenced by the stage of pregnancy (p = 0.05). the susceptibility tests revealed that s. aureus developed a strong resistance to aminopenicillins (66.67%) and cephalosporins (>44.44%), while enterobacteriaceae  was resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones. (16.67%). conclusion: this study  showed that pregnant women in sokode are still exposed to vaginal infection, caused mostly by g. vaginalis and candida species. these results underline the need for at least one vaginal swab culture for each woman during pregnancy.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == antenatal microbiologic and maternal risk factors associated with prematurity.
AB  == in a prospective study of 202 women (gestational age 24 +/- 4 weeks), we evaluated possible influences of lower genital tract infection or bacterial conditions on obstetric outcomes, including preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth. the presence of bacterial vaginosis (18.7%) was associated with an increased risk of preterm labor (relative risk, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 6.46). for women with bacterial vaginosis who also had mobiluncus species morphotypes identified on gram stain, the relative risk of preterm labor was 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 11.5). presence of vaginal mycoplasma hominis (10.8% of patients) was associated with both preterm labor (relative risk, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 4.4) and preterm birth (relative risk, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.45 to 17.9). recovery of staphylococcus aureus (3.0%) was associated with preterm labor (relative risk, 3.1; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 8.7). identification of two  or more bacterial-linked abnormalities was also associated with preterm labor (relative risk, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 7.58). an increased level of vaginal wash protease (greater than or equal to 10 trypsin units) (16%) was associated with preterm labor and was noted in 50% of women with preterm premature rupture of membranes. a history of prior preterm birth was the single best historical predictor of both preterm labor (relative risk, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 to 6.83) and preterm birth (relative risk, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 20.4). history of three or more abortions, antenatal  urinary tract infection, and occurrence of medical complications during pregnancy also correlated with increased risk of preterm labor. these findings affirm and refine associations of various maternal reproductive tract infections with preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and birth, allowing for controlled treatment trials aimed at prevention of preterm birth.

TI  == mobiluncus species and other anaerobic bacteria in non-puerperal breast abscesses.
AB  == samples of 109 breast masses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for mobiluncus spp. using selective and non-selective media. two of the 103 evaluable samples were sterile and 57 (55%) yielded facultative bacteria only. the remaining 44 (43%) contained anaerobic growth alone or mixed infections. seven (16%) of the 44 samples with anaerobes, six from women and one from a man, yielded mobiluncus spp. six were identified as mobiluncus curtisii and one as mobiluncus mulieris. there were two types of breast abscesses: one with staphylococcus aureus predominating and one with anaerobes predominating. most of the anaerobes belonged to the normal vaginal flora, but some were members of the  normal oral flora. these results support the hypothesis that breast infections with these anaerobes result from sexual activities.

TI  == comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole  against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (bv) or skin infections by agar dilution mic determinations. bv-associated bacteroides isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus-b. oralis group, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but bacteroides spp. not associated with bv, bacteroides ureolyticus and the bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. all bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of g. vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. varied. among the skin bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. this antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == on a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: mobiluncus, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. inhibition zones were observed in the growth of  all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. the inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. four bacteroides fragilis strains as well  as 2 out of 4 staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. the inhibition zones were generally wider at ph 5.5 than at 6.0. for all inhibited strains, (the s. aureus excepted) a low ph on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.

TI  == activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

TI  == antigenic and biochemical characteristics of mobiluncus mulieris and mobiluncus curtisii.
AB  == twenty-four strains of mobiluncus mulieris and 27 strains of mobiluncus curtisii  were tested with respect to 6 different biochemical characteristics: arginin-decarboxylase activity, beta-galactosidase activity, synergistic hemolysis with staphylococcus aureus, hydrolysis of hippurate, migration through  soft agar and reduction of nitrate. antigens of the same strains, prepared by ultrasonication, were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using polyclonal rabbit antisera against two of the m. mulieris strains and five of the m. curtisii strains. two different strongly reacting protein antigens could be detected in the m. mulieris strains. these strains could be separated into three groups based on the possession of either of the two antigens or both. in the m. curtisii strains, 10  strongly reacting protein antigens could be detected. four strains possessed only one of these antigens, one did not possess any, while the remaining strains possessed different sets of 9 of them. within each species common protein antigens were detected. no antigens were found which were shared by both species. the biochemical characteristics studied could not differentiate between the antigenic groups in any of the species. none of the antigenic subgroups of m. curtisii found in the present study was identical with any of the two subspecies  (curtisii and holmesii) which have been proposed.
