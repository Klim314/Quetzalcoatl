actin enables the antimicrobial action of ll-37 peptide in the presence of microbial proteases.
host defense peptides play an important host-protective role by their microcidal  action, immunomodulatory functions, and tissue repair activities. proteolysis is a common strategy of pathogens used to neutralize host defense peptides. here, we show that actin, the most abundant structural protein in eukaryotes, binds the ll-37 host defense peptide, protects it from degradation by the proteases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis, and enables its antimicrobial activity despite the presence of the proteases. co-localization of ll-37 with extracellular actin was observed in necrotized regions of samples from oral lesions. competition assays, cross-linking experiments, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry revealed that ll-37 binds by specific hydrophobic interactions to the his-40-lys-50 segment of actin, located in the dnase i binding loop. the integrity of the binding site of both ll-37 and actin is a prerequisite to the binding. our results demonstrate that actin, presumably released by dead cells and abundant in infected sites, might be utilized by the immune system to enhance spatio-temporal immunity in an attempt to arrest infection and control inflammation.
porphyromonas gingivalis modulates pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced apoptosis of respiratory epithelial cells through the stat3 signaling pathway.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of respiratory and other organ systems in immunocompromised hosts that may invade and proliferate in mucosal epithelial cells to induce apoptosis. previous studies suggest that oral bacteria, especially gram-negative periodontal pathogens, may enhance p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to augment tissue destruction. in this study, we investigated the effect of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis on p. aeruginosa-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. p. gingivalis invasion transiently inhibited p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) signaling pathway. the activated stat3 up-regulated the downstream anti-apoptotic moleculars survivin and b-cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2). this process was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptosis molecular bcl-2-associated death promoter (bad) and caspase-3 activity inhibition. in addition, the activation of the stat3 pathway was affected by p. gingivalis in a dose-dependent manner. finally, co-invasion of p. aeruginosa and p. gingivalis led to greater cell death compared with p. aeruginosa challenge alone. these results suggest that regulation of p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis by p. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. interference with this process may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disease.
gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome. postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.
community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.
immunopharmacological activities of the nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid a of porphyromonas gingivalis.
the low endotoxic lipid a derived from porphyromonas gingivalis 381, 1-phospho beta(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, induced mitogenic responses in lps low responder c3h/hej as well as lps responder c3h/hen mouse splenocytes. the mitogenic activities of p. gingivalis lipid a in splenocytes of lps responder mice were comparable to that of the synthetic escherichia coli-type lipid a (compound 506). the addition of polymyxin b resulted in the inhibition of mitogenic activity. p. gingivalis lipid a also stimulated strongly nonspecific host resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in balb/c mice, and specific immune response in guinea pigs against infection with p. gingivalis. furthermore, p. gingivalis lipid a demonstrated antitumour activity against mh134 hepatoma in c3h/hen mice. these life-preserving with tumour regression properties were comparable to those of monophosphoryl lipid a derived from salmonella minnesota re 595. thus, p. gingivalis lipid a appears to have beneficial properties as an immunopharmacological agent.
