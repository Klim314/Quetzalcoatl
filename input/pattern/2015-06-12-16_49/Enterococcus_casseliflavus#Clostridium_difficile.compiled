TI  - [Bacteremia due to Clostridium difficile].
AB  - We describe a case of bacteremia due to Clostridium difficile, which was successfully treated by intravenous vancomycin. A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of third degree burn injuries. She was treated with cefazolin for two weeks followed with flomoxef for one week before the operation (debridement and grafting of skin). On the third postoperative day high fever (temperature 40 degrees C), abdominal pain and severe watery diarrhea developed. Antibiotic-associated colitis with bacteremia was diagnosed presumptively, flomoxef was stopped, and oral and intravenous therapy with vancomycin was started. A blood culture taken before the administration of vancomycin yielded C. difficile accompanied with Enterococcus faecalis and Enetrococcus casseliflavus. A stool culture taken on the next day yielded C. difficile, and a stool latex agglutination test was also positive. The patient improved slowly. Parenteral vancomycin was discontinued after two weeks. One week later, the patient developed pneumonia, and imipenem/cilastatin was added. Soon after addition of the agent, she developed recurrent diarrhea despite continual oral vancomycin therapy. The fecal samples obtained at this time were positive for C. difficile by culture and positive for toxins A & B. She was satisfactorily treated with oral vancomycin for a total of four weeks. After the following two weeks, however, recurrence of diarrhea developed again, which rapidly decreased with oral vancomycin for seven days. The patient did well thereafter and was discharged. All three C. difficile isolates from blood and fecal specimens were positive for toxins A & B, and identified the same PCR ribotyping pattern.
TI  - Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  - AIM: To describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of Enterococcus species in Auckland. BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. It is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. METHODS: Enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group I were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group II were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group III were enterococci from stool specimens sent for Clostridium difficile toxin testing; group IV were isolates from stool specimens submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. All enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 121 group I enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. Enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group II specimens; 166/279 (60%) group III specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group IV specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were E faecalis, 12% E faecium, 6% E gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. No isolate produced beta-lactamase. All E faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. Two E faecium and one enterococcus species were resistant to amoxycillin (MICs all 16 mg/L). All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. Fourteen E gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (MICs of 8 mg/L). One E faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC 8 mg/L). High level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., E casseliflavus and E gallinarum. Our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. This allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.
