TI  == lactate has the potential to promote hydrogen sulphide formation in the human colon.
AB  == high concentrations of sulphide are toxic for the gut epithelium and may contribute to bowel disease. lactate is a favoured cosubstrate for the sulphate-reducing colonic bacterium desulfovibrio piger, as shown here by the stimulation of sulphide formation by d. piger dsm749 by lactate in the presence of sulphate. sulphide formation by d. piger was also stimulated in cocultures with the lactate-producing bacterium bifidobacterium adolescentis l2-32. other lactate-utilizing bacteria such as the butyrate-producing species eubacterium hallii and anaerostipes caccae are, however, expected to be in competition with the sulphate-reducing bacteria (srb) for the lactate formed in the human colon. strains of e. hallii and a. caccae produced 65% and 96% less butyrate from lactate, respectively, in a coculture with d. piger dsm749 than in a pure culture. in triculture experiments involving b. adolescentis l2-32, up to 50% inhibition of butyrate formation by e. hallii and a. caccae was observed in the presence of d. piger dsm749. on the other hand, sulphide formation by d. piger was unaffected by e. hallii or a. caccae in these cocultures and tricultures. these experiments strongly suggest that lactate can stimulate sulphide formation  by srb present in the colon, with possible consequences for conditions such as colitis.

TI  == two routes of metabolic cross-feeding between bifidobacterium adolescentis and butyrate-producing anaerobes from the human gut.
AB  == dietary carbohydrates have the potential to influence diverse functional groups of bacteria within the human large intestine. of 12 bifidobacterium strains of human gut origin from seven species tested, four grew in pure culture on starch and nine on fructo-oligosaccharides. the potential for metabolic cross-feeding between bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing firmicute bacteria related to eubacterium hallii and anaerostipes caccae was investigated in vitro. e. hallii l2-7 and a. caccae l1-92 failed to grow on starch in pure culture, but in coculture with b. adolescentis l2-32 butyrate was  formed, indicating cross-feeding of metabolites to the lactate utilizers. studies with [(13)c]lactate confirmed carbon flow from lactate, via acetyl coenzyme a, to butyrate both in pure cultures of e. hallii and in cocultures with b. adolescentis. similar results were obtained in cocultures involving b. adolescentis dsm 20083 with fructo-oligosaccharides as the substrate. butyrate formation was also stimulated, however, in cocultures of b. adolescentis l2-32 grown on starch or fructo-oligosaccharides with roseburia sp. strain a2-183, which produces butyrate but does not utilize lactate. this is probably a consequence of the release by b. adolescentis of oligosaccharides that are available to roseburia sp. strain a2-183. we conclude that two distinct mechanisms of metabolic cross-feeding between b. adolescentis and butyrate-forming bacteria may operate in gut ecosystems, one due to consumption of fermentation end products (lactate and acetate) and the other due to cross-feeding of partial breakdown products from complex substrates.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.
