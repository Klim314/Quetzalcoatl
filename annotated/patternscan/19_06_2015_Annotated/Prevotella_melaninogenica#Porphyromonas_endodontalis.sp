TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == quantitative microbiological study of human carious dentine by culture and real-time pcr: association of anaerobes with histopathological changes in chronic pulpitis.
AB  == the bacteria found in carious dentine were correlated with the tissue response of the dental pulps of 65 teeth extracted from patients with advanced caries and pulpitis. standardized homogenates of carious dentine were plated onto selective  and nonselective media under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. in addition, real-time pcr was used to quantify the recovery of anaerobic bacteria.  primers and fluorogenic probes were designed to detect the total anaerobic microbial load, the genera prevotella and fusobacterium, and the species prevotella melaninogenica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis,  and micromonas (formerly peptostreptococcus) micros. the pulpal pathology was categorized according to the cellular response and degenerative changes. analysis of cultured bacteria showed a predominance of gram-positive microorganisms, particularly lactobacilli. gram-negative bacteria were also present in significant numbers with prevotella spp., the most numerous anaerobic group cultured. real-time pcr analysis indicated a greater microbial load than that determined by colony counting. the total number of anaerobes detected was 41-fold greater by real-time pcr than by colony counting, while the numbers of prevotella and fusobacterium spp. detected were 82- and 2.4-fold greater by real-time pcr than by colony counting, respectively. real-time pcr also identified m. micros, p. endodontalis, and p. gingivalis in 71, 60, and 52% of carious samples, respectively. correlation matrices of the real-time pcr data revealed significant positive associations between m. micros and p. endodontalis detection and inflammatory degeneration of pulpal tissues. these anaerobes have been strongly implicated in endodontic infections that occur as sequelae to carious pulpitis. accordingly, the data suggest that the presence of high levels of these bacteria  in carious lesions may be indicative of irreversible pulpal pathology.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the rapid id 32a system (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france) for the identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the  bacteroides fragilis group. methods: five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-b. fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were tested in the rapid id 32a system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. results: the rapid id 32a system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. a further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by  the manufacturer. fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level  only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. three isolates of prevotella were not identified by the system. of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. conclusions: the rapid id 32a system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-b. fragilis group, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. there was poor discrimination between fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum, between porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis, and between prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella oralis. the need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of porphyromonas and prevotella species.
AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == immunobiological activities of a 55-kilodalton cell surface protein of prevotella intermedia atcc 25611.
AB  == a protein was extracted from whole cells of prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 with sodium lauroylsarcosine and purified by chromatography on a deae-sepharose fast-flow column. the the apparent molecular weight of the protein was 55,000. a  mouse polyclonal antibody specific for the protein recognized the cell surface structure of p. intermedia and also reacted with proteins in lysates of other black-pigmented anaerobic bacteria, such as porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella melaninogenica, but not with those in lysates of porphyromonas gingivalis or with the purified fimbriae of p. gingivalis 381. the n-terminal sequence of the 55-kda protein showed only low homology with the cell surface proteins of any black-pigmented bacteria reported to date. the level of immunoglobulin g antibody to the antigen was higher in the sera of patients with  periodontitis than in the sera of healthy volunteers. the protein induced interleukin-1 alpha, -1 beta, -6, and -8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and interleukin-1 beta and -6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures. the protein induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha activities in peritoneal macrophages from c3h/hej as well as from c3h/hen mice and also induced cytokine activities in the sera of both strains of mice primed with muramyldipeptide.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == classification of black-pigmented anaerobes by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms)  and conventional tests (cts).
AB  == clinical (66: dental 53; vaginal 4; wound 9) and reference (5*) strains of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were examined in pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) and conventional tests (cts). the strains were identified in cts as: prevotella intermedia (48*); pr. melaninogenica (1); pr. corporis (7); porphyromonas asaccharolytica (12*); p. endodontalis (1*) and p. gingivalis (2*). numerical classification based on cts resolved five clusters comprising strains identified as (i) pr. corporis, (ii) pr. melaninogenica, (iii) pr. intermedia, (iv) p. gingivalis and (v) p. asaccharolytica and p. endodontalis. numerical classification based on pms showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity in the order pr. intermedia, pr. corporis, p. asaccharolytica, in agreement with the ordering of homogeneity for these species in cts. pms clusters corresponding the porphyromonas spp. were clearly distinct from those of prevotella spp. pms and ct classifications disagreed on cluster membership for only six of the strains. pms identification from blind challenge sets agreed with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.

TI  == classification of oral pigmented anaerobic bacilli by pyrolysis mass spectrometry and biochemical tests.
AB  == clinical (66) and reference (5) strains of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, identified as prevotella intermedia (47), pr. melaninogenica (1), pr. corpora (8), porphyromonas asaccharolyticus (12), p. endodontalis (1) and p. gingivalis (2), were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) and in conventional tests. numerical classification based on conventional test reaction  patterns (ctrps) resolved five clusters, four comprising strains identified as pr. intermedia, pr. corpora, pr. melaninogenica, and p. gingivalis respectively,  and one comprising strains identified as p. asaccharolyticus and p. endodontalis. numerical classification based on pms showed a similar division, with decreasing  homogeneity of chemical composition in the order pr. intermedia, pr. corpora, p.  asaccharolyticus, which agreed with the order of homogeneity in ctrps. pms clusters corresponding to the genus porphyromonas were clearly distinct from those of the genus prevotella. pms and ctrp classification disagreed on cluster membership for six strains. pms identification from blind challenge sets was in agreement with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.

TI  == rapid presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by using 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives.
AB  == a rapid method for presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was developed. using filter paper spot tests for indole production, sialidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and trypsinlike enzyme activities, 100% of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides levii and 89% of prevotella corporis isolates were correctly identified to the species level. porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis could not be differentiated from each other but could  be distinguished from all other species tested. similarly, prevotella denticola,  prevotella loescheii, and prevotella melaninogenica could not be differentiated from each other. the methods described are based on 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives of the various substrates and are simple to perform, rapid (less than 15 min), and applicable to difficult-to-cultivate anaerobic rods.

TI  == cross-inhibition between black-pigmented bacteroides species.
AB  == cross-inhibition within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides, including both  oral and non-oral strains, was studied by means of a membrane filter technique. it was found that b. gingivalis possessed the most extended inhibitory capacity among all species tested. b. gingivalis showed inhibitory activity against b. intermedius, b. endodontalis, b. loescheii, and b. melaninogenicus. b. endodontalis was active against some b. intermedius strains. among the saccharolytic species, some b. melaninogenicus strains were inhibitory for some b. endodontalis strains, some b. gingivalis strains, and some b. intermedius strains. these inhibitory activities observed in vitro may play a role in the colonization of the periodontal pocket.
