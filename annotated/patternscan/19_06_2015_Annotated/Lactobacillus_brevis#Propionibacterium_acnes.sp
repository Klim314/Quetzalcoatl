TI  == lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  == the intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates  was investigated. snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of bulgaria. one hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of lab, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. the snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by enterococcus (17 isolates), lactococcus (12 isolates), leuconostoc (7 isolates), lactobacillus (18 isolates)  and weissella (1 isolate). the species affiliation of lactococcus lactis (12), leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. the lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence  analysis of 16s rdna as lactobacillus brevis (12), l. plantarum (2), lactobacillus graminis (1) and lactobacillus curvatus (3). the species l. brevis, l. graminis and l. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas l. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of l. mesentereoides p4/8 against propionibacterium acnes. the present study showed that the lab are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive  system. this is the first report on lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of  c. aspersum.
