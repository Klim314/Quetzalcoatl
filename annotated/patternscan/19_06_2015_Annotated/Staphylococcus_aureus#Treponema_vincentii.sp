TI  == an inexpensive solid medium for obtaining colony-forming units of oral spirochetes.
AB  == a method for the enumeration of colony-forming units of oral anaerobic spirochetes in new oral spirochete agarose (nos-a) medium was described recently. however, the high cost of agarose limits the extent to which large assays can be  carried out. accordingly, a search for an inexpensive gelling agent that remains  molten at 37 degrees c and gels at 25 degrees c was undertaken. varying amounts of noble agar or bacto agar (0.5 to 1.5%, w/v) were mixed with varying amounts of gelatin (0.5 to 1.0%, w/v) in nos medium. nos medium containing 0.5% gelatin-0.5% noble agar (nos-gn) or 0.5% gelatin-0.5% bacto agar (nos-gb) met the above criteria. nos-gn and nos-gb media yielded higher colony-forming units with treponema denticola than nos-a medium in that order. however, all three media, nos-gn, nos-gb and nos-a, performed equally well in the recovery of viable counts of t. vincentii. the nos-gn medium was not liquefied by subgingival bacteria or two gelatinase-producing species of bacteria, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. thus nos-gn medium is the recommended medium both in cost  and performance for obtaining colony counts of spirochetes.
