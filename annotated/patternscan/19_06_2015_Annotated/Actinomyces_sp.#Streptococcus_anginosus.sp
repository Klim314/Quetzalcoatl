TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == establishment of an oral infection model resembling the periodontal pocket in a perfusion bioreactor system.
AB  == periodontal infection involves a complex interplay between oral biofilms, gingival tissues and cells of the immune system in a dynamic microenvironment. a  humanized in vitro model that reduces the need for experimental animal models, while recapitulating key biological events in a periodontal pocket, would constitute a technical advancement in the study of periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to use a dynamic perfusion bioreactor in order to develop a gingival epithelial-fibroblast-monocyte organotypic co-culture on collagen sponges. an 11 species subgingival biofilm was used to challenge the generated tissue in the bioreactor for a period of 24 h. the histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis displayed an epithelial-like layer on the surface of the collagen sponge, supported by the underlying ingrowth of gingival fibroblasts, while monocytic cells were also found within the sponge mass. bacterial quantification of the biofilm showed that in the presence of the organotypic tissue, the growth of selected biofilm species, especially campylobacter rectus, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, and porphyromonas gingivalis, was suppressed, indicating a potential antimicrobial effect by the tissue. multiplex immunoassay analysis of cytokine secretion showed that interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-2, il-4, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels in cell culture supernatants were significantly up-regulated in presence of the biofilm, indicating a positive inflammatory response of the organotypic tissue to the biofilm challenge. in conclusion, this  novel host-biofilm interaction organotypic model might resemble the periodontal pocket and have an important impact on the study of periodontal infections, by minimizing the need for the use of experimental animal models.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == bactericidal effect of nd:yag laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (nd:yag) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. methodology: the hypothesis was tested ex vivo that nd:yag laser irradiation has  a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (csem) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct nd:yag laser irradiation, respectively. results: the nd:yag laser irradiation (1.5 w, 15 hz, four times for 5 s) of enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0.05, wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a  99.7% kill, but no sterilization. the csem procedure verified that the extent of  radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. after 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of actinomyces naeslundii or streptococcus anginosus were discernible. however, when micro-colonies of s. anginosus and specially biofilms of e. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using esem and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. conclusions: the nd:yag laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == direct amplification of rrna gene sequences for identification of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections and their relationship with symptoms using a highly sensitive technique, the polymerase chain reaction. methodology: samples were obtained from 91 infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions, including cases of acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted from the samples and analysed for the presence of target microbial species using a pcr-based identification assay. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria. streptococcus anginosus group was detected in 16.7%, fusobacterium nucleatum in 14.3%, and bacteroides forsythus in 7.1% of the abscess samples. no pus sample yielded actinomyces israelii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fungal species. in general, b. forsythus was found in 20% of the cases (16 of 80), s. anginosus in 12% (6 of 50), f. nucleatum in 10% (6 of 60) and a. israelii in 5% (two of 40). a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any case. fungi were present in only one of 50 cases (2%). there was  no correlation between the species and symptoms. conclusions: direct molecular approaches appear to be a valuable tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as for research purposes. there was no correlation between target microbial species and symptoms.

TI  == actinomyces species, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of actinomyces species,  streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples. all root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, actinomyces species in 9.4%, and e. faecalis in 7.5%. the most prevalent species were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. with regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most  prevalent species were s. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), e. faecalis (11.5%),  and s. anginosus (7.7%). s. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). the other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were a. gerencseriae (14.8%), s. gordonii (11.1%), s. intermedius (11.1%), a. israelii (7.4%), s. anginosus (7.4%), and s. sanguis (7.4%). s. constellatus was  the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  == the aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). the isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from  the species streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus group c, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative rods from the genus haemophilus and rods from the enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of moraxella catarrhalis. the isolated anaerobic microorganisms gram-negative rods from the genus prevotella, bacteroides, fusobacterium, gram-positive cocci from the genus peptostreptococcus. other organisms from the genus vailonella, eubacterium and actinomyces were isolated less frequently. in 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == surface-associated properties of streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  == thirty strains from the streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (smg) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes. the smg strains were heterogeneous in all tests. most (18) belonged to one of the lancefield groups with group f predominating. adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). compared with strains of s. sanguis, smg strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. they differed from the type strain of s. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for s. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than  0.001). the ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. the amount of fibronectin bound by smg strains  correlated with their ability to adhere to sha (p less than 0.001). the hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. a minority of strains possessed  a net positive cell-surface charge. neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to sha. strains of smg co-aggregated weakly with strains of veillonella parvula, v. dispar, actinomyces  viscosus and a. naeslundii.

TI  == prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

TI  == bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in young adult humans.
AB  == from replicate trials of experimental gingivitis in four periodontally healthy subjects, 166 bacterial species and subspecies were detected among 3,034 randomly selected isolates from 96 samples. of these bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii (serotype iii and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), actinomyces odontolyticus (serotype i and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus species d-2, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella parvula, and treponema species a appeared to be the most likely etiological agents of gingivitis. statistical interpretations indicated that the greatest source of microbiological variation of the total flora observed was person-to-person differences in the floras. the next greatest source of variation was the inflammatory status of the sample sites. person-to-person differences were smallest at experimental day 4. the floras became more diverse with time and as gingivitis developed and progressed. analyses indicated that sequential colonization by certain species was repeatable and therefore probably predictable. variation was relatively small between replicate trials, between two sites on the same teeth sampled on the same day, and between the same sites sampled at the same relative time in a replicate trial.
