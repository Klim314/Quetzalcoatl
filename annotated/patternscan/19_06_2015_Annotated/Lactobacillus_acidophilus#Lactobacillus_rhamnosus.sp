TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens.  they are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by clinical laboratory standards institute and international dairy foundation. their use as probiotics for prevention of clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will  the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. they are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with l. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas l. rhamnosus and l. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

TI  == a decade of experience in primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection at a community hospital using the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+).
AB  == in august 2003, the 284-bed community hospital pierre-le gardeur (plgh) in quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the clostridium difficile nap1/027/bi strain. augmented standard preventive measures (spms) were not able to control this outbreak. it was decided in february 2004 to give to every adult  inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (bio-k+: lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. augmented spms were continued. the use of the probiotic in addition to spms was associated with  a marked reduction of c. difficile infection (cdi). during the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received bio-k+, and the cdi rate at plgh declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. additionally, 10-year data collected by the ministry of health in quebec comparing the cdi rate between quebec hospitals showed that cdi rates at plgh were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. blood cultures were monitored at plgh for lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic bio-k+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary cdi rate.

TI  == perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. we evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (pns) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group s [lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)cfu, lactobacillus rhamnosus hs 111, 1 x 10(9) cfu, lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9)  cfu, bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)cfu, and fructooligosaccharides (fos) 100  mg]--or placebo-controls--group c, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. the incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group s (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group c (16  of 23 patients, 69.6%) (p = 0.00). duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group s (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group c; p = 0.01). noninfectious complications were less common in group s (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group c; p = 0.03). mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group s vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group c (p = 0.00). no deaths occurred in group s,  whereas 6 deaths occurred in group c (p = 0.02). perioperative administration of  synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for pns.

TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == does maternal perinatal probiotic supplementation alter the intestinal microbiota of mother and child? a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == objectives: maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) in their offspring. we aimed to investigate whether probiotics in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers altered the colonization pattern and the diversity of the mothers' and children's intestinal microbiota. methods: in a randomized, double-blind trial, women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation until 3 months postnatally whilst breastfeeding. the probiotic milk contained lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), l.  acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. stool samples  were collected from the mothers at 30 to 36 weeks gestation and 3 months after birth, and from the child at age 10 days, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years, and bacteria were analysed by quantitative pcr. additionally, stool samples from 3 months old and 2 years old children were characterized using 16s rrna gene deep sequencing to estimate the bacterial classes and genera, and the alpha and beta diversity. results: three months after birth, both the prevalence and the relative abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria were significantly increased among the mothers in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. only the lgg bacteria colonized the children at 10 days and at 3 months of age. there were no significant differences in the abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria between the groups at 1 and 2 years of age. for the bacterial  classes and genera, and alpha and beta diversity there were no significant differences between the groups. conclusions: different probiotic bacteria seem to have different ability to transfer from the mother to the child. we found no evidence that the probiotics altered the microbial composition or alpha and beta  diversity of the children.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 and acidophilus r0052) reduce the expression of toll-like receptor 4 in mice with alcoholic liver disease.
AB  == objective: the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) and toll-like receptor 4 (tlr 4)  in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ald) has been widely established. we evaluated the biological effects of probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011  and acidophilus r0052), krg (korea red ginseng), and urushiol (rhus verniciflua stokes) on ald, including their effects on normal and high-fat diet in mice. methods: one hundred c57bl/6 mice were classified into normal (n) and high-fat diet (h) groups. each group was divided into 5 sub-groups: control, alcohol, alcohol+probiotics, alcohol+krg, and alcohol+urushiol. a liver function test, histology, electron-microscopy, interleukin (il)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, il-6, and il-10, and tlr 4 were evaluated and compared. results: in  the n group, probiotics, krg, and urushiol significantly reduced levels of tnf-alpha (12.3+/-5.1, 13.4+/-3.9, and 12.1+/-4.3 vs. 27.9+/-15.2 pg/ml) and il-1beta (108.4+/-39.4, 75.0+/-51.0, and 101.1+/-26.8 vs. 162.4+/-37.5 pg/ml), which were increased by alcohol. alcohol-induced tlr 4 expression was reduced by  probiotics and urushiol (0.7+/-0.2, and 0.8+/-0.1 vs. 1.0+/-0.3, p<0.001). in the h group, il-10 was significantly increased by probiotics and krg, compared with alcohol (25.3+/-15.6 and 20.4+/-6.2 vs. 7.6+/-5.6 pg/ml) and tlr 4 expression was reduced by probiotics (0.8+/-0.2 vs. 1.0+/-0.3, p = 0.007). conclusions: alcohol-induced tlr 4 expression was down-regulated by probiotics in the normal and high-fat diet groups. probiotics, krg, and urushiol might be effective in the treatment of ald by regulating the gut-liver axis.

TI  == inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. we employed 4 different lactobacillus species,  namely l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. reuteri, and 2 c. albicans strains, the reference day286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the fjs24 strain. as assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (cfsf) affected candida,  impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. the cfsf-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the c. albicans hwp1 genotype.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering potentials of lactic acid bacteria based on bile-salt hydrolase activity and effect of potent strains on cholesterol metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == this study collected different probiotic isolates from animal and plant sources to evaluate the bile-salt hydrolase activity of probiotics in vitro. the deconjugation potential of bile acid was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. hepg2 cells were cultured with probiotic strains with high bsh activity. the triglyceride (tg) and apolipoprotein b (apo b) secretion by hepg2 cells were evaluated. our results show that the bsh activity and bile-acid deconjugation abilities of pediococcus acidilactici nbhk002, bifidobacterium adolescentis nbhk006, lactobacillus rhamnosus nbhk007, and lactobacillus acidophilus nbhk008 were higher than those of the other probiotic strains. the cholesterol concentration in cholesterol micelles was reduced within 24 h. nbhk007 reduced the tg secretion by 100% after 48 h of incubation. nbhk002, nbhk006, and nbhk007 could reduce apo b secretion by 33%, 38%, and 39%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. the product probio s-23 produced a greater decrease in the total concentration of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, tg, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance in the serum or livers of hamsters with hypercholesterolemia compared with that of hamsters fed with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. these results show that the three probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria are better candidates for reducing the  risk of cardiovascular disease.

TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB  == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of  vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were  also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological  analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans  resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == eruca sativa might influence the growth, survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and some biological features of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
AB  == the growth and viability of three lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, after their passage through simulated gastric and pancreatic juices were studied as a function of their presence in the growth medium of rocket salad (eruca sativa). the presence of e. sativa affected some of the biological properties of the strains. for example, l. acidophilus and l. plantarum worked more efficiently in  the presence of e. sativa, increasing not only the antioxidant activity of the medium, but also their own antioxidant power and antimicrobial activity; l. rhamnosus was not affected in the same manner. overall, the presence of vegetables might help to boost, in specific cases, some of the characteristics of lactobacilli, including antioxidant and antimicrobial power.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

AB  == purpose: the prevalence of candida infections has been rising with an increasingly aging population and a larger population of immunocompromised individuals. the use of probiotics may be an alternative approach to antifungal agents in the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis. this study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of probiotics in reducing the infection level of oral candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers. materials and methods: in a double-blind randomized study, 59 denture wearers harboring candida spp. in the oral cavity with no clinical symptoms were allocated into two groups: probiotic and placebo. all patients were instructed to clean the denture daily. the probiotic group poured a capsule containing lyophilized lactobacillus rhamnosus hs111, lactobacillus acidophillus hs101, and bifidobacterium bifidum daily on the palatal surface of the maxillary denture, whereas the placebo group  was submitted to the same regimen using placebo capsules. candida spp. infection  levels were evaluated in palate mucosa samples obtained before and after a 5-week experimental period. results: all patients harbored candida in the palate mucosa  at baseline. fifty-five individuals completed the experimental period. the detection rate of candida spp. was 92.0% in the placebo group after the experimental period, whereas it was reduced to 16.7% in the probiotic group. the  reduction promoted by the probiotic regimen was independent of baseline characteristics such as candida infection level and colonizing species, age of denture, and other variables. conclusion: the probiotic product was effective in  reducing the colonization of the oral cavity with candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers, suggesting that this multispecies probiotic could be used to prevent oral candidiasis. clinical implications: colonization of oral surfaces by candida is considered a risk factor for invasive fungal infections. the use of a product with l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, and b. bifidum may represent an alternative treatment for reduction  of candida infections in elderly denture wearers.

TI  == synbiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus+lactobacillus acidophilus+inulin) attenuates oxidative stress and colonic damage in 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride-induced colon carcinogenesis in sprague-dawley rats: a long-term  study.
AB  == the inexorable increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer has led to growing  interest in its prevention by natural interventions. thus, the present study was  designed with the aim of delineating the antioxidative and antitumorigenic effects of synbiotics in experimental colon carcinogenesis. it was observed that  administration of a synbiotic, before 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (dmh)-induced colon carcinogenesis in sprague-dawley rats, led to increased body  weight and growth rate, and decreased tumor incidence compared with the dmh-only-treated group of animals. most notably, the level of malondialdehyde, a  measure of lipid peroxidation, decreased, and levels of the antioxidants, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase increased in animals in the lactobacillus acidophilus+dmh, inulin+dmh, and synbiotic+dmh groups compared with dmh-only-treated animals. histopathological observations of  the colon also documented fewer dysplastic changes and increased the number of goblet cells in the probiotic-treated, prebiotic-treated, and synbiotic-treated animals compared with dmh-only-treated animals. taken together, the present study shows that the use of synbiotics is a better prophylactic strategy than the use of probiotic and prebiotic alone because of the greater increase in antioxidants  associated with the higher degree of attenuation of dmh-induced tumorigenesis.

TI  == co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  == most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. the peanut-soy milk (psm(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (lab), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees c and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees  c. the pediococcus acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), lactococcus lactis (cct 0360), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr 32) probiotic lab, and the lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus (lb 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of  about 8.3log cfu/ml during fermentation. however, these strains were not able to  acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. the lactobacillus acidophilus (laca 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35  g/l) and rapidly lowered the ph (4.6). saccharomyces cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in psm and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/l). in pure culture, s. cerevisiae (ufla  yffbm 18.03), l. rhamnosus (lr 32), l. acidophilus (laca 4), and p. acidilactici  (ufla bffcx 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). however, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population  of 8log cfu/ml in psm. lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a ph value of 4.3. in general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. an average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1) and l. acidophilus (laca 4), and by co-culture of  p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), l. acidophilus (laca 4) and s. cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/l, respectively). the final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.

TI  == fermentation adaptability of three probiotic lactobacillus strains to oat, germinated oat and malted oat substrates.
AB  == functional foods targeting the improvement of gastrointestinal health are widely  recognized; of these, dairy-based probiotics are the most popular. thus, the design of nondairy probiotics applying fruits, vegetables and cereals has raised  great interest in the healthy food sector. the objective of this work was to assess the potential of germinated and malted oat substrates to support the growth of the probiotic cultures lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. fermentations were carried out with distinctive oat  substrates at inoculum levels of 3, 5 and 7% v/v, substrate concentrations of 3,  5 and 7% w/v and with sucrose addition 1.5% w/v. lag phase profiles, maximum growth rates and maximal growths were evaluated; protein and sugar contents were  also quantified. there was no significant effect (p > 0.05) of the inoculum size  on the fermentation kinetics; however, oat media significantly affected the growth kinetics. in simple oat media, lact. acidophilus exhibited biphasic growth patterns. lactobacillus growth patterns were significantly affected (p < 0.05) by the supplementation with protein sources. the germination and malting processes significantly improved oats nutrient characteristics demonstrating to be adequate substrates for the fermentation with probiotic lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: in this work, the effect of oat media composition and fermentation conditions on the growth kinetics of three probiotic lactobacilli was determined. the variation in the inoculum levels did not have a significant effect on the probiotic cultures growth. results revealed that protein supplemented simple, germinated and malted oat enhanced the cell viability of the probiotic lactobacilli; lactobacillus casei exhibited better growth adaptability. the results also highlight that different weight in volume oat substrate concentrations has particular effects on lact. casei growth kinetics. our results contribute to a better understanding of oat-based media formulations as substrates for probiotic cultures.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == in vivo gut transcriptome responses to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus acidophilus in neonatal gnotobiotic piglets.
AB  == probiotics facilitate mucosal repair and maintain gut homeostasis. they are often used in adjunct with rehydration or antibiotic therapy in enteric infections. lactobacillus spp have been tested in infants for the prevention or treatment of  various enteric conditions. however, to aid in rational strain selection for specific treatments, comprehensive studies are required to delineate and compare  the specific molecules and pathways involved in a less complex but biologically relevant model (gnotobiotic pigs). here we elucidated lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg) and l. acidophilus (la) specific effects on gut transcriptome responses in  a neonatal gnotobiotic (gn) pig model to simulate responses in newly colonized infants. whole genome microarray, followed by biological pathway reconstruction,  was used to investigate the host-microbe interactions in duodenum and ileum at early (day 1) and later stages (day 7) of colonization. both la and lgg modulated common responses related to host metabolism, gut integrity, and immunity, as well as responses unique to each strain in gn pigs. our data indicated that probiotic  establishment and beneficial effects in the host are guided by: (1) down-regulation or upregulation of immune function-related genes in the early and later stages of colonization, respectively, and (2) alternations in metabolism of small molecules (vitamins and/or minerals) and macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). pathways related to immune modulation and carbohydrate metabolism were more affected by lgg, whereas energy and lipid metabolism-related transcriptome responses were prominently modulated by la. these findings imply that identification of probiotic strain-specific gut responses could facilitate the rational design of probiotic-based interventions to moderate specific enteric conditions.

TI  == use of probiotics for management of acute gastroenteritis: a position paper by the espghan working group for probiotics and prebiotics.
AB  == the use of probiotics has been suggested in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis (age) in addition to early rehydration and avoidance of dietary restrictions. this document provides recommendations for the use of probiotics for the treatment of age in previously healthy infants and children based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic reviews and of randomized controlled trials (rcts) published subsequently to these reviews. the recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 rcts that used a given probiotic (with strain specification) were available. the grade system developed  by the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations working group, was used to grade the strength of evidence and grades of recommendations used in these guidelines. it offers 4 categories of the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) and 2 categories of the strength of recommendation (strong or weak). the use of the following probiotics  (in alphabetical order) may be considered in the management of children with age  in addition to rehydration therapy: lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation) and saccharomyces boulardii (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). less compelling evidence is available for lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation) and heat-inactivated lactobacillus acidophilus lb (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation). the latter, although traditionally discussed with other probiotics, does not fit with the definition of probiotics.  other strains or combinations of strains have been tested, but evidence of their  efficacy is weak or preliminary.

TI  == shelf life stability of lactobacilli encapsulated in raspberry powder: insights into non-dairy probiotics.
AB  == aim: study the shelf-life quality changes in raspberry juice with encapsulated lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus nrrl b-4495 and lactobacillus acidophilus nrrl b-442) obtained by spray drying and understand the various factors involved. methods and results: raspberry powder was obtained from spray drying lactobacilli and raspberry juice with maltodextrin as an additive. shelf life of the powder was analyzed over a period of 30 d. acid and bile tolerance and antibiotic resistance was compared before and after spray drying. water activity, survival,  and scanning electron microscope images were also measured during the shelf life. conclusions and significance: a combination of processing conditions: inlet temperature ( degrees c), maltodextrin to juice solids ratio and inlet feed rate  (ml/min) during spray drying had a significant role on the survival of lactobacilli during shelf life. refrigerated storage provided a higher shelf-life stability with regards to cfu/g (as high as 84% on day 0 and 98% retention by the end of 30 d) compared to room temperature storage. probiotic properties during shelf life are affected by the processing conditions and encapsulated food matrix. thus, understanding these aspects in vitro during shelf life gives us a brief insight into the future of non-dairy probiotics.

TI  == effects of probiotics on the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis: a review.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common cause of genital discomfort in women in reproductive ages, which causes many complications. bacterial vaginosis  is usually treated by metronidazole and clindamycin. however, this protocol does  not prevent its recurrence, which is a main complaint of the patients. the number of lactobacilli in the vagina of women with bv is significantly lower than that in healthy women. hence, efforts have been made to normalize vaginal flora by oral or vaginal administration of lactobacilli. the objective of the present study was to review clinical evidences available regarding the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of bv. materials and methods: published randomized controlled trials were searched in pubmed, science direct, and the cochrane database between 1990 and 2011. search terms included bacterial  vaginosis, urinary tract infection, lactobacillus, and probiotics. results: orally consumed probiotics are believed to ascend to the vaginal tract after they are excreted from the rectum; vaginal administration allows for direct replacement of the probiotics for unhealthy vaginal microbiota and occupation of  specific adhesion sites at the epithelial surface of the urinary tract, which consequently results in maintenance of a low ph and production of antimicrobial substances like acids and hydrogen peroxide. receiving lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1, and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 at a dose of at least 10 cfu/day for 2 months has been shown to present the patients with better  results. conclusions: although the results of different studies are controversial, most studies have been in favor of the probiotics in the prevention or treatment of bv, and no adverse effects have been reported. therefore, it may be helpful to recommend daily consumption of probiotic products to improve public health among women.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of prebiotic oligosaccharides by bifidobacterium lactis hn019 and lactobacillus spp.
AB  == the utilisation of various prebiotic oligosaccharides by probiotic strains of bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated in order to determine the synbiotic potential of various prebiotic/probiotic combinations. analysis by hplc and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography of the cell-free medium taken during growth of the  three probiotic bacteria showed differences in the consumption of the various oligosaccharides. analysis of galactooligosaccharides showed that both l. rhamnosus and b. lactis consumed mostly mono- and di-saccharide, while l. acidophilus consumed oligosaccharides up to trisaccharide. both b. lactis and l.  acidophilus utilised fructooligosaccharides and inulin, but showed different patterns of oligosaccharide consumption. only l. rhamnosus grew on beta-glucan oligosaccharides and preferentially consumed the trisaccharide. the results indicate the synbiotic potential of the various probiotic/prebiotic combinations, particularly l. acidophilus/galactooligosaccharides, l. acidophilus/fructooligosaccharides or inulin and l. rhamnosus/beta-glucan oligosaccharides.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == purification and characterization of anti-alicyclobacillus bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus cicc 20975 produces a 6,502-da bacteriocin, named bacteriocin rc 20975, active against alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, bacillus subtilis, and listeria  innocua. this bacteriocin is not quite heat stable but is effective after refrigerated storage and freeze-thaw cycles. bacteriocin rc 20975 was added at a  concentration of 256 au/ml to the endospores of a. acidoterrestris dsm 3922; no viable cells were detected after 24 h. the primary mode of action of bacteriocin  rc 20975 seems to be the formation of pores, as indicated by k(+) efflux from metabolically active cells of a. acidoterrestris. however, efflux of larger cytoplasmic content was not observed within the first 30 min after bacteriocin rc 20975 treatment. in addition, adsorption of bacteriocin rc 20975 to target cells  at different temperatures and ph levels and in the presence of surfactants was studied. finally, the effect that different media, media components, and addition of vitamins to the media had on bacteriocin rc 20975 production was also studied.

TI  == changes in satiety hormone concentrations and feed intake in rats in response to  lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a negative energy balance can be accomplished by reducing the caloric intake which results in an increased feeling of hunger. this physiological state is regulated by secretion of satiety hormones. the secretion of these hormones can be influenced by ingestion of e.g. fat. fat, dairy beverage and synbiotic mixture have been found to have satiety-inducing effects in humans and rats. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the change of satiety hormone concentration  in rats in response to feeding of fermented milks containing lactic acid bacteria. two studies were conducted with wistar rats randomly allocated into groups receiving lactobacillus fermented (2 l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. salivarius and l. rhamnosus) milk. a single isocaloric oral dose with the test item or control was given to the rats. blood samples were taken after dosing with the test product and the satiety hormones were measured. for the test groups, significant changes could be detected in pyy concentrations after 60 min, although some groups had a significant lower feed intake. in conclusion, some probiotic lactobacillus strains may modify satiety hormones production. however,  more studies are needed to evaluate their potential of prolonging satiety.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus kacc 12419, lact. casei kacc 12413, lact. paracasei kacc 12427 and lact. rhamnosus kacc 11953) and  pathogens (salmonella typhimurium kccm 40253 and listeria monocytogenes kacc 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. the highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), lact. casei (17.2%) and lact. acidophilus (15.1%). salm. typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. the numbers of l. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with lact. paracasei and lact. rhamnosus. the results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  == probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. the aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. this is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. all children were treated with conventional  hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) cfu live bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. the primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea  and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. the duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children  receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). the duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). the effect  of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. the percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. in conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.

TI  == alleviating effects of lactobacillus strains on pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus strains against vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. six-week-old icr mice were pretreated with four lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 (serotype o3:k6). the results showed that v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (fa)  and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. in contrast, significant alleviation of fa was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of lactobacillus strains (p < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that  received low-dose pretreatments. among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus h15 and lactobacillus brevis y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal fa and villi damage in treated mice (p < 0.05). two low-adhesive strains, lactobacillus acidophilus y14-3 and lactobacillus fermentum f16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. at the same dosing levels, no significant differences in fa were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. our findings suggest that lactobacillus strains can alleviate v. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fa in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.

TI  == characterization of the lactobacillus casei group based on the profiling of ribosomal proteins coded in s10-spc-alpha operons as observed by maldi-tof ms.
AB  == the taxonomy of the members of the lactobacillus casei group is complicated because of their phylogenetic similarity and controversial nomenclatural status.  in this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) of ribosomal proteins coded in the s10-spc-alpha operon, termed s10-germs, was applied in order to classify 33 sample strains belonging to the l. casei group. a total of 14 types of ribosomal protein genes coded in the operon were first sequenced from four type strains of the l. casei group (l. casei jcm 1134(t), l. paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 8130(t), l. paracasei subsp. tolerans jcm 1171(t), and l. rhamnosus jcm 1136(t)) together with l. casei jcm 11302, which is the former type strain of 'l. zeae'. the theoretical masses of the 14 types of ribosomal proteins used as biomarkers were  classified into five types and compiled into a ribosomal protein database. the observed ribosomal proteins of each strain, identified by maldi-tof ms, were categorized into types based on their masses, summarized as ribosomal protein profiles, and they were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. the 33 sample strains, together with seven genome-sequenced strains, could be classified into four major clusters, which coincided precisely with the taxa of the (sub)species  within the l. casei group. three "ancient" strains, identified as l. acidophilus  and l. casei, were correctly re-identified as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei by s10-germs. s10-germs would thus appear to be a powerful tool for phylogenetic characterization, with considerable potential for management of culture collections.

AB  == the cross-talk between the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota is critical in mucosal tissue homeostasis as well as in protection against infectious and inflammatory diseases occurring at mucosal sites. this recent evidence has paved the way to therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the mucosa-associated immune system using probiotics. different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate dendritic cell (dc) activation, polarizing the subsequent t cell activity toward th1 (e.g. lactobacillus (lb) acidophilus),  th2 (lb.reuteri and bifidobacterium bifidum) or, as more recently demonstrated, th17 responses induced by specific strains such as lb.rhamnosus gg and lac23a, the latter isolated in our laboratory. here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of probiotics effects on mucosal immunology, particularly on cells of the innate immunity such as dcs. we also highlight our own experiences in modulating dc functions by commensal bacteria and discuss the relevance of probiotics administration in the treatment of human immunopathologies.

TI  == comparison of the kinetics of intestinal colonization by associating 5 probiotic  bacteria assumed either in a microencapsulated or in a traditional, uncoated form.
AB  == background: beneficial findings concerning probiotics are increasing day by day.  however, one of the most important parameters able to significantly affect the probiotic value of a microorganism is its survival during the transit through the stomach and the duodenum. some techniques may be applied that aim to improve this parameter, but microencapsulation of bacterial cells remains one of the most important. a recent study assessed the kinetics of intestinal colonization by a mixture of 2 probiotic strains, given either in a microencapsulated or in a traditional, uncoated form. methods: a comparison between the intestinal colonization by associating 5 microencapsulated bacteria and the same uncoated strains was performed by a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. the study  (december 2007 to january 2009) involved 53 healthy volunteers. in particular, subjects were divided into 2 groups: group a (27 subjects) was given a mix of probiotic strains probiotical s.p.a. (novara, italy), lactobacillus acidophilus la02 (dsm 21717), lactobacillus rhamnosus lr04 (dsm 16605), l. rhamnosus gg, or lgg (atcc 53103), l. rhamnosus lr06 (dsm 21981), and bifidobacterium lactis bs01  (lmg p-21384) in an uncoated form, whereas group b (26 subjects) received the same strains microencapsulated with a gastroprotected material. the uncoated strains were administered at 5x10(9) cfu/strain/d (a total of 25x10(9) cfu/d) for 21 days, whereas the microencapsulated bacteria were given at 1x10(9) cfu/strain/d (a total of 5x10(9) cfu/d) for 21 days. at the end of the first period of supplementation with probiotics, a 3-week wash-out phase was included in the study setting. at the end of the wash-out period, the groups crossed over  their treatment regimen; that is, group a was administered the microencapsulated  bacteria and group b the uncoated bacteria. the administered quantities of each strain were the same as the first treatment. a quantitative evaluation of intestinal colonization by probiotics, either microencapsulated or uncoated, was  undertaken by examining fecal samples at the beginning of the study (time 0), after 10 days and after 21 days of each treatment period. in particular, fecal total lactobacilli, heterofermentative lactobacilli, and total bifidobacteria were quantified at each checkpoint. a genomic analysis of an appropriate number of colonies was performed to quantify individual l. rhamnosus strains among heterofermentative lactobacilli. results: a statistically significant increase in the fecal amounts of total lactobacilli, heterofermentative lactobacilli, and total bifidobacteria was registered in both groups at the end of each supplementation period compared with d(0) or d(4)(2) (group a: p=0.0002, p=0.0001, and p<0.0001 at d(2)(1), p=0.0060, p=0.0069, and p<0.0001 at d(6)(3) for total lactobacilli, heterofermentative lactobacilli, and bifidobacteria, respectively; group b: p=0.0002, p=0.0006, and p<0.0001 at d(2)(1), p=0.0015, p=0.0016, and p<0.0001 at d(6)(3) for total lactobacilli, heterofermentative lactobacilli, and bifidobacteria, respectively), confirming the ability of each strain in the administered composition to colonize the human gut, whether supplemented in a gastroprotected or in a traditional freeze-dried form. on the contrary, subjects receiving microencapsulated bacteria reported a kinetics of intestinal colonization that was entirely comparable with those who were given uncoated strains at a 5 times higher amount. conclusions: the microencapsulation  technique used in this study is a valid approach aimed to significantly improve the survival of strains during gastroduodenal transit, thus enhancing their probiotic value and allowing the use of a 5 times lower amount.

TI  == fermentation of sugars and sugar alcohols by plaque lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objective: the objective was to analyse the ability of lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. material and methods: fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. growth and ph were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. results: no differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. all strains lowered the ph to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. a ph of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. the ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among lactobacillus fermentum strains. conclusion: a large number of lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to ph levels critical for enamel demineralisation. clinical relevance: our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental  plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.

AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == gut balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  == synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. a double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of gut balance, which contains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (l. casei 431(r)), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12(r)), lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5(r)), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg(r)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain  fatty acids (scfa), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. all subjects randomized were included in the analysis. there was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal l. paracasei numbers with gut balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. gut balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum il-16 in comparison to acacia gum  from pre- to post-study. no substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal scfa concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or gi permeability. clinical studies are now required to determine whether gut balance may exert beneficial gi health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal l. paracasei. both supplements had little effect on immunity. twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.

AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  == probiotic cultures of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with nacl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. in some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was  applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (bgp) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. for most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of bgp supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. addition of the bgp supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium  did not enhance survival to air-drying. furthermore, addition of bgp to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. this study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use  air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == cytokine profile and induction of t helper type 17 and regulatory t cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  == the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant  secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of  th17 and t(reg) cells.

AB  == the utilization of 1-kestose (gf(2)) and nystose (gf(3)), the main components of  fructooligosaccharides (fos), by lactobacillus and bacteroides species was examined. of seven lactobacillus and five bacteroides strains that utilized fos,  l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, and l. gasseri utilized only gf(2), whereas l. acidophilus and all the bacteroides strains utilized both gf(2) and gf(3). only the strains able to utilize both gf(2) and gf(3) had beta-fructosidase activity in the culture supernatants. the culture supernatants  of the lactobacillus strains had higher beta-fructosidase activity for gf(2) than for gf(3), whereas those of the bacteroides strains had higher activity for gf(3) than for gf(2). furthermore, beta-fructosidase activity of the culture supernatants of the lactobacillus cells grown in the gf(3) medium was much higher than that of the cells grown in the gf(2) medium, whereas the activity of the culture supernatants of the bacteroides cells grown in the gf(3) medium was almost the same as that of the cells grown in the gf(2) medium. these results indicate that lactobacillus species metabolize fos in a different way from that of bacteroides species.

TI  == differential targeting of the e-cadherin/beta-catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  == the intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. however, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. probiotic bacteria  have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, and l. rhamnosus, in a t84 cell epithelial barrier model. results of dna microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as e-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr).  furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. in addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction  proteins and the abundance of protein kinase c (pkc) isoforms such as pkcdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal  diseases (e.g., ibd).

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == treatment with probiotics in experimental oral colonization by candida albicans in murine model (dba/2).
AB  == the aim of this study is to evaluate the oral colonization by candida albicans in experimental murine immunosuppressed dba/2 and treatment with probiotic bacteria. to achieve these objectives, 152 dba/2-immunosuppressed mice were orally inoculated with a suspension of c. albicans containing 10(8) viable yeast cells,  the animals were treated with nystatin or with the probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus rhamnosus). evaluations were performed by candida count from oral mucosa swabbing. the oral mucosa colonization by c. albicans started at day 1 after inoculation, remained maximal from day 3 until day 7, and  then decreased significantly. probiotics reduced the c. albicans colonization significantly on the oral mucosa in comparison with the untreated animal group. in the group treated with l. rhamnosus, the reduction in yeast colonization was significantly higher compared with that of the group receiving nystatin. immunosuppressed animal model dba/2 is a relevant model for experimental candida  oral colonization, and the treatment with probiotics in this model may be an effective alternative to prevent it.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == metabolism of l-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. we investigated the metabolism of l-selenomethionine (semet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with semet and selenite in rats. when semet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (streptococcus salivarius k12, lactobacillus rhamnosus 67b, lactobacillus acidophilus l10, and bifidobacterium lactis lafti(r) b94) at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of semet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (dmdse) and dimethylselenide  (dmse). in similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to dmse and dmdse accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either semet or  selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or semet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (semet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. probiotic treated rats given semet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given semet. thus, treatment with probiotics followed  by semet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.

TI  == upregulation of p-glycoprotein by probiotics in intestinal epithelial cells and in the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis in mice.
AB  == p-glycoprotein (p-gp) mediates efflux of xenobiotics and bacterial toxins from the intestinal mucosa into the lumen. dysregulation of p-gp has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease. certain probiotics have been shown to be effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease. however, direct effects of probiotics on  p-gp are not known. current studies examined the effects of lactobacilli on p-gp  function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells. caco-2 monolayers and a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were utilized. p-gp activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive [(3)h]digoxin transepithelial flux.  multidrug resistant 1 (mdr1)/p-gp expression was measured by real-time quantitative pcr and immunoblotting. culture supernatant (cs; 1:10 or 1:50, 24 h) of lactobacillus acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment of differentiated caco-2 monolayers (21 days postplating) increased ( approximately  3-fold) mdr1/p-gp mrna and protein levels. l. acidophilus or l. rhamnosus cs stimulated p-gp activity ( approximately 2-fold, p < 0.05) via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and erk1/2 mapk pathways. in mice, l. acidophilus or l. rhamnosus treatment (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) increased mdr1a/p-gp mrna and protein  expression in the ileum and colon (2- to 3-fold). in the dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis model (3% dss in drinking water for 7 days), the degree of  colitis as judged by histological damage and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced by l. acidophilus. l. acidophilus treatment to dss-treated mice blocked the reduced expression of mdr1a/p-gp mrna and protein in the distal colon. these findings suggest that lactobacilli or their soluble factors stimulate p-gp expression and function under normal and inflammatory conditions. these data provide insights into a novel mechanism involving p-gp upregulation in beneficial effects of probiotics in intestinal inflammatory disorders.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == survivability of probiotics encapsulated in alginate gel microbeads using a novel impinging aerosols method.
AB  == encapsulation of probiotic bacteria in cross-linked alginate beads is of major interest for improving the survivability in harsh acid and bile environment and also in food matrices. alginate micro beads (10-40 mum) containing the probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm were produced by a  novel technique based on dual aerosols of alginate solution and cacl(2) cross linking solution. extruded macro beads (approximately 2mm diameter) produced by the conventional method and micro beads produced by novel aerosols technique offered comparable protection to l. rhamnosus in high acid and bile environment.  chitosan coating of micro beads resulted in a significant increase in survival time of l. rhamnosus from 40 to 120 min in acid condition and the reduction in cell numbers was confined to 0.94 log over this time. alginate macro beads are more effective than micro beads in protecting l. acidophilus against high acid and bile. chitosan coating of micro beads resulted in similar protection to l. acidophilus in macro beads in acid and extended the survival time from 90 to at least 120 min. viability of this organism in micro beads was 3.5 log after 120 min. the continuous processing capability and scale-up potential of the dual aerosol technique offers potential for an efficient encapsulation of probiotics in very small alginate micro beads below sensorial detection limits while still being able to confer effective protection in acid and bile environment.

TI  == probiotic cheese containing lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm(r) modifies subpopulations of fecal lactobacilli and clostridium difficile in the elderly.
AB  == aging is associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota and with immunosenescence. probiotics have the potential to modify a selected part of the  intestinal microbiota as well as improve immune functions and may, therefore, be  particularly beneficial to elderly consumers. in this randomized, controlled cross-over clinical trial, we assessed the effects of a probiotic cheese containing lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on the intestinal microbiota and fecal immune markers of 31 elderly volunteers and compared these effects with the administration of the same cheese without probiotics. the probiotic cheese was found to increase the number of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus ncfm in the feces, suggesting the survival of the strains during the gastrointestinal transit. importantly, probiotic cheese administration was associated with a trend towards lower counts of clostridium difficile in the  elderly, as compared with the run-in period with the plain cheese. the effect was statistically significant in the subpopulation of the elderly who harbored c. difficile at the start of the study. the probiotic cheese was not found to significantly alter the levels of the major microbial groups, suggesting that the microbial changes conferred by the probiotic cheese were limited to specific bacterial groups. despite that the administration of the probiotic cheese to the  study population has earlier been shown to significantly improve the innate immunity of the elders, we did not observe measurable changes in the fecal immune iga concentrations. no increase in fecal calprotectin and beta-defensin concentrations suggests that the probiotic treatment did not affect intestinal inflammatory markers. in conclusion, the administration of probiotic cheese containing l. rhamnosus hn001 and l. acidophilus ncfm, was associated with specific changes in the intestinal microbiota, mainly affecting specific subpopulations of intestinal lactobacilli and c. difficile, but did not have significant effects on the major microbial groups or the fecal immune markers.

AB  == lactulose can be considered as a prebiotic, which is able to stimulate healthy intestinal microflora. in the present work, the use of this ingredient in fermented milk improved quality of skim milk fermented by lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and bifidobacterium lactis in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus. compared to control fermentations without lactulose, the addition of such a prebiotic in skim milk increased the counts of all probiotics, with particular concern to b. lactis (bifidogenic effect), the acidification rate and the lactic acid acidity, and concurrently reduced the time to complete fermentation (t(ph4.5)) and the ph at the end of cold storage for 1 to 35 days.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == rapid molecular identification and characteristics of lactobacillus strains.
AB  == eleven type strains and 24 lactobacillus isolates, preliminarily classified to the species due to phenotypic features, were investigated. standard methods of identification with species-specific pcrs and typing with pfge (with apai, noti and smai restriction enzymes) allowed us to distinguish 16 unique strains belonging to 5 species (l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. salivarius). alternative approach with 16s-23s rdna ardra identification (with merely two restrictases, bsuri and taqi) and pcr-based typing (rapd with two random- and rep-pcr with (gtg)(5) primers) showed to be more discriminative, i.e. 21 unique strains were classified in the same species as above. as a result, 7 out of 24 phenotypically species-assigned isolates were  reclassified. the alternative procedure of rapid identification and typing of lactobacillus isolates appeared to be equally effective and shortened from 1 week to 2-3 d (in comparison to the standard methods).

TI  == intestinal lactobacilli and the dc-sign gene for their recognition by dendritic cells play a role in the aetiology of allergic manifestations.
AB  == diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in westernized communities. the development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. the present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific lactobacillus species and genetic variations in dc-sign, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) and sensitization in infancy. within the koala birth cohort study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five lactobacillus species: l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri. eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the dc-sign gene were genotyped in these children. allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of ad and sensitization (specific ige) at age 2 years. l. rhamnosus (31.5 %), l. paracasei  (31.3 %) and l. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas l. casei (2.5 %) and l. reuteri (<1 %)  were rare. colonization with l. paracasei decreased the risk of ad significantly  (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of l. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). two dc-sign polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. the present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in dc-sign in association with  the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.

TI  == human mucosal in vivo transcriptome responses to three lactobacilli indicate how  probiotics may modulate human cellular pathways.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, specific representatives of bacterial species that are a common part of the human microbiota, are proposed to deliver health benefits to the consumer by modulation of intestinal function through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. to explore in vivo mucosal responses of healthy adults to probiotics, we obtained transcriptomes in an intervention study after a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. in the mucosa of the proximal  small intestine of healthy volunteers, probiotic strains from the species lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, and l. rhamnosus each induced differential gene-regulatory networks and pathways in the human mucosa. comprehensive analyses revealed that these transcriptional networks regulate major basal mucosal processes and uncovered remarkable similarity to response profiles obtained for specific bioactive molecules and drugs. this study elucidates how intestinal mucosa of healthy humans perceives different probiotics and provides avenues for  rationally designed tests of clinical applications.

TI  == probiotics in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhoea. a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial using two different probiotic preparations in bolivian children.
AB  == background: evidence suggests that probiotics reduce rotavirus diarrhoea duration. although there are several probiotic strains potentially useful, daily  practice is often limited by the type and number of products locally available. in general, information about combined products is scarce. in this study we compare the effect of two probiotic products in the treatment of diarrhoea in children less than 2 years of age. methods: a randomized double-blind controlled  clinical trial in children hospitalized for acute rotavirus diarrhoea, in the paediatric centre albina patino, cochabamba, bolivia.participants were children aged 1 - 23 months, who were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: oral rehydration therapy plus placebo; oral rehydration solution plus saccharomyces boulardii; or oral rehydration solution plus a compound containing  lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum and saccharomyces boulardii. sample size was 20 per group and the outcomes were duration of diarrhoea, of fever, of vomiting and of hospitalization. results: 64  cases finished the protocol. on admission, patients' characteristics were similar. median duration of diarrhoea (p = 0.04) in children who received the single species product (58 hours) was shorter than in controls (84.5 hrs). comparing children that received the single probiotic product and controls showed shorter duration of fever (18 vs 67 hrs) (p = 0.0042) and the mixed probiotic of  vomiting (0 vs 42.5 hrs) (p = 0.041). there was no effect on duration of hospitalization (p = 0.31). when experimental groups were merged, statistical significance of changes increased (total duration of diarrhoea, fever and vomiting p = 0.025, p = 0.025 and p = 0.014, respectively). conclusions: both products decreased the duration of diarrhoea compared to oral rehydration solution alone. this decrease was significant only for the single species product which also decreased the duration of fever. with the multiple species product there was no vomiting subsequent to the initiation of treatment. the quantity of  probiotic bacteria needed for optimum treatment of gastroenteritis remains to be  determined, particularly when multiple species are included in the product.trial  registration: clinicaltrials.gov id: nct00981877link: https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/selectprotocol/sid/s0002653/se lectaction/view/ts/2/uid/u0000n04 trial registration: clinical trials nct id: nct00981877.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (ipec-j2) of rotavirus infection as a new model for the study of innate immune responses to rotaviruses and probiotics.
AB  == previous studies of epithelial immune responses to rotavirus infection have been  conducted in transformed cell lines. in this study, we evaluated a non-transformed porcine jejunum epithelial cell line (ipec-j2) as an in-vitro model of rotavirus infection and probiotic treatment. cell-culture-adapted porcine rotavirus (prv) osu strain, or human rotavirus (hrv) wa strain, along with lactobacillus acidophilus (la) or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) were used to inoculate ipec-j2 cells. la or lgg treatment was applied pre- or post-rotavirus infection. we demonstrated that ipec-j2 cells were productively infected by prv. la or lgg treatment of the cells did not reduce virus replication. prv infection increased muc3 mucin secretion. lgg treatment post-rotavirus infection reduced the mucin secretion response induced by prv; lgg alone increased the production of membrane-associated muc3 mucin. la treatment prior to rotavirus infection significantly increased prv replication and the il-6 response to prv infection, which is consistent with the adjuvant effect of la. lgg treatment post-rotavirus infection downregulated the il-6 response, confirming the anti-inflammatory effect of lgg. ipec-j2 cells expressed toll-like receptor (tlr) 2, tlr3, and tlr9 constitutively. tlr2 expression was upregulated  by lgg and peptidoglycan, corresponding to the decreased il-6 response, indicating that the protective effect of lgg is associated with upregulation of tlr2 expression on intestinal epithelial cells. the ipec-j2 cell model of prv infection is a completely homologous system. it is a valuable model for studying  the interactions among rotavirus-host-probiotics, and the mechanisms behind the immunomodulating effect of probiotic bacteria on innate immune responses.

AB  == oral intake of specific probiotics has been reported to enhance the immunity of the elderly. earlier studies have used milk or yoghurt as a probiotic carrier. we chose a commercial probiotic cheese to evaluate its potential as a probiotic food. thirty-one healthy elderly volunteers (21 female, 10 male) aged from 72 to  103 (median 86) consumed a commercial probiotic cheese containing approximately 10(9) cfu day(-1) of lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus  ncfm. the 4-week probiotic intervention was preceded by a 2-week consumption of probiotic-free cheese (run-in) and followed by a 4-week wash-out period with the  same control cheese. the cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), the relative numbers of natural killer (nk) and nkt cells in the total pbmcs, and phagocytic activity were assessed. consumption of the probiotic cheese significantly increased the cytotoxicity of nk cells. a significant increase in phagocytosis was observed for both the control and the probiotic cheese. cheese was found to be an effective carrier for the study of probiotics, and daily consumption of the probiotic enhanced parameters of innate immunity in elderly volunteers. it remains to be determined whether this enhancement correlates with  a beneficial effect on the health of the elderly population.

TI  == anti-inflammatory actions of probiotics through activating suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) expression and signaling in helicobacter pylori infection: a novel mechanism.
AB  == background and aims: in spite of the international agency for research on cancer's definition that helicobacter pylori is the definite carcinogen of gastric cancer, the simple eradication of the bug is not enough to prevent resultant gastric cancer, and increasing microbial resistance further limits the  eradication application. therefore, probiotics, non-pathogenic microbial feed that can affect the host in a beneficial manner, could be an alternate way to enhance anti-inflammation against h. pylori. however, the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory actions is still unclear. in the current study, we hypothesized that suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) signaling could be a feasible anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics against h. pylori infection. results: h. pylori infection or their lipopolysaccharide stimulation led to significant increased expressions of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in ags cells and pretreatment of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly attenuated the expressions of these inflammatory mediators in accordance with the blocking action of nuclear factor-kappab nuclear translocation. probiotic administration increased expression of socs-2 and socs-3 and exerted the active socs signaling featured with earlier and higher expressions of socs-2 and socs-3. in contrast to weak inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases including p-38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, probiotic-induced socs expressions were mediated through either significant phosphorylation of signal transducers and activation of transcription (stat)-1 and stat-3 or simultaneous inhibition of janus kinase (jak)2 phosphorylation, which is known to signal socs-2/socs-3 negatively. conclusion: anti-inflammatory signals of socs through stat-1/stat-3 activation and jak2 inactivation might be a key anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics, setting probiotics as a non-microbial strategy to h. pylori infection.

TI  == ai-2 signalling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of lactobacillus  spp.
AB  == survival and ability to respond to various environmental stresses such as low ph  are important factors for lactobacilli for their function as probiotics. luxs-mediated quorum sensing mechanism, which is based on the production of universal signal molecule called autoinducer-2 (ai-2), regulates important physiological traits and a variety of adaptive processes in different bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acidic stress on luxs-mediated quorum sensing (ai-2 signalling) in four probiotic strains of different lactobacillus species. initially, the production of ai-2-like molecule  was investigated in four strains of lactobacillus spp. at standard growth conditions using vibrio harveyi bioluminescence assay. species variation in ai-2  activity was observed. ai-2 activity started at early-exponential growth phase and increased during the mid-exponential phase concomitant with the reduction of  ph, reaching maximum at late exponential phase (l. rhamnosus gg) or at stationary phase (l. salivarius ucc118, l. acidophilus ncfm and l. johnsonii ncc533). acidic shock experiments were conducted on l. rhamnosus gg and l. acidophilus ncfm after exposure to different acidic shocks (ph 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0) and to ph 6.5 as control, measuring ai-2 activity and transcription of the luxs gene. ai-2 activity increased by lowering the ph in a dose dependent manner and was negatively influenced by acid adaptation. in both species, the luxs gene was repressed after exposure to ph 6.5 as control. however, after acidic shock (ph 4.0) a transient response of luxs gene was observed and the transcription augmented over time, reaching a maximum level and decreased subsequently. acid adaptation of cells attenuated the transcription of this gene. based on the observations done in the present study, the luxs gene appears to have a clear role in acidic stress response in probiotic lactobacilli. this might be important in the survival of these bacteria during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, and further influence the cell-to-cell communication among bacteria in the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == effect of homogenization techniques on reducing the size of microcapsules and the survival of probiotic bacteria therein.
AB  == this study investigated 2 different homogenization techniques for reducing the size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation process of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, bifidobacterium longum, b. lactis type bi-04, and b. lactis type bi-07. two different homogenization techniques were used, namely, ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer and microfluidics microfluidizer. various settings on the homogenization equipment were studied such as the number  of passes, speed (rpm), duration (min), and pressure (psi). the traditional mixing method using a magnetic stirrer was used as a control. the size of microcapsules resulting from the homogenization technique, and the various settings were measured using a light microscope and a stage micrometer. the smallest capsules measuring (31.2 microm) were created with the microfluidizer using 26 passes at 1200 psi for 40 min. the greatest loss in viability of 3.21 log cfu/ml was observed when using the ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer with a speed of 1300 rpm for 5 min. overall, both homogenization techniques reduced capsule sizes; however, homogenization settings at high rpm also greatly reduced  the viability of probiotic organisms.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == lactobacilli inhibit shigella dysenteriae 1 induced pro-inflammatory response and cytotoxicity in host cells via impediment of shigella-host interactions.
AB  == objective: shigella dysenteriae type 1 dysentery is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children from less developed and developing countries. the present study explores the hypothesis that lactobacilli protect the host cell during s. dysenteriae type 1 infection and its mechanism of action. methods: caco-2 cells incubated for 1h with lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactobacillus acidophilus at the multiplicity of infection of 100, either alone or in combination followed by addition of shigella at the same multiplicity of infection for 5h served as treatment groups. cells incubated with shigella without lactobacilli addition served as infected cells. at the end of experimental period, cells were processed suitably to enumerate adherent and internalized shigella. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess mrna expression of interleukin-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. immunoblot for heat shock protein-70 and cytotoxicity assay were performed. results: pretreatment with the combination of lactobacilli significantly (p<0.05) prevented adherence and internalization of shigella coupled with reduced expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 in host cells. conclusion: l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, synergistically offered better protection during s. dysenteriae type 1 infection by efficiently inhibiting adherence and internalization of shigella coupled with inhibition of pro-inflammatory response.

TI  == coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == an improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-l-lysine (popl) to alginate (alg) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. eight strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l.  acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with popl. electron microscopy was  used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. to assess if the addition of popl improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both alg and popl microcapsules were inoculated into ph 2.0 mrs broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used  to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in alg and popl microcapsules. to assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 fam), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a uv spectrophotometer. the results indicated that coating the microcapsules with popl increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. however, microcapsules with added popl had a much smoother surface texture  when examined under an electron microscope. the results also indicated that the addition of popl to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log cfu/ml when compared to alg microcapsules at 2 h of exposure  to acidic conditions. however, similar plate counts were observed between alg and popl microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. this suggests that an extra coating of popl could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (git). upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that popl microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.

TI  == probiotics and prevention of allergic disease.
AB  == purpose of review: over the past few decades, public reports have shown increasing enthusiasm for the potential health effects of probiotics. therefore,  the purpose of this review is to focus on studies, which have addressed the use of probiotics for primary prevention of atopic diseases. recent findings: the finnish study of kalliomaki was the first report to describe that the frequency of atopic dermatitis in neonates treated with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) was half that of the placebo. recently, these results have been questioned by two trials, which reported no difference in the development of atopic dermatitis in neonates supplemented with lgg and l. acidophilus, respectively. in contrast, an  unexpected increase in respiratory side-effects was observed in some studies in children who received the probiotics. up to now no data have been released which  report a positive effect of probiotics for the prevention of allergic rhinitis or asthma. moreover, an allergen-preventive effect of probiotics for the development of atopic dermatitis could not be consistently established. summary: in conclusion, probiotics cannot be generally recommended for primary prevention of  atopic disease. further studies should clarify if any susceptible subgroups exist and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains. moreover, the selection of the most beneficial probiotic strain or the composition of different probiotics and/or prebiotics, the dose and the timing of supplementation still need to be determined.

TI  == identification of probiotic lactobacilli used for animal feeds on the basis of 16s ribosomal rna gene sequence.
AB  == the use of probiotics such as lactobacillus in animal feeds has gained popularity in recent years. in this study the 16s rrna gene sequence of l. acidophilus in two commercial agents which have been used in animal feeds, lab-mos and ghenisson 22, was determined. phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the two agents, strain mnflm01 in lab-mos and strain gal-2 in ghenisson 22, belonged to l. rhamnosus (a member of the l. casei group) and l. johnsonii (a member of the l. acidophilus group), respectively. biochemical tests assigned the two as l. rhamnosus and ambiguously as l. acidophilus. the data suggest that 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis provides more accurate identification of lactobacillus species  than biochemical tests and would allow quality assurance of relevant commercial products. the 16s rrna gene sequences of strains mnflm01 and gal-2 determined in  this study have been submitted to the ddbj/embl/genbank accession numbers under accession numbers ab288235 and ab295648, respectively.

TI  == lactobacilli facilitate maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during shigella dysenteriae 1 infection in rats.
AB  == objective: lactobacilli are used in various dairy products and fermented foods for their potential health beneficial effects. recently we reported the protective role of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus acidophilus during shigella dysenteriae 1 infection. nevertheless, investigations on the membrane-stabilizing effect of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus have not been done. hence, the present study evaluated the effect of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus on the maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during s. dysenteriae 1-induced diarrhea in rats. methods: rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6 in each group). induced rats received single oral dose of s. dysenteriae (12 x 10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml). treated rats received l.  rhamnosus (1 x 10(7)cfu/ml) or l. acidophilus (1 x 10(7)cfu/ml) orally for 4 d, alone or in combination, followed by shigella administration. at the end of the experimental period, animals were sacrificed and the assay of membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatases (na(+)/k(+)-atpase, ca(2+)-atpase, and total atpase), immunoblot analysis of tight junctional proteins (claudin-1 and occludin), and transmission electron microscopic studies were performed. results: induced rats showed a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the membrane-bound atpases and reduced expression of tight junction proteins in the membrane, coupled with their increased expression in the cytosol, indicating membrane damage. transmission electron microscopic studies correlated with biochemical parameters. pretreatment with combination of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus significantly prevented these changes. conclusion: lactobacillus rhamnosus and l. acidophilus synergistically offered better protection to the intestinal membrane when compared with individual treatments with these strains during s. dysenteriae 1 infection.

AB  == the simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium lactis with streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. in particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (ph, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (cla) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees c for 24 h. fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. all probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these b. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by s. thermophilus-l. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.

TI  == probiotic pre-treatment reduces gliclazide permeation (ex vivo) in healthy rats but increases it in diabetic rats to the level seen in untreated healthy rats.
AB  == aim: to investigate the influence of probiotic pre-treatment on the permeation of the antidiabetic drug gliclazide in healthy and diabetic rats. methods: wistar rats (age 2-3 months, weight 350 +/- 50 g) were randomly allocated into one of 4  groups (n = 16 each group): healthy control, healthy probiotic, diabetic control, and diabetic probiotic. probiotics (75 mg/kg, equal quantities of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, and lactobacillus rhamnosus) were administered twice a day for three days to the appropriate groups after diabetes  had been induced with alloxan i.v. 30 mg/kg. rats were sacrificed, ileal tissues  mounted in ussing chambers and gliclazide (200 microg/ml) was administered for the measurement of the mucosal to serosal absorption jss((mtos)) and serosal to mucosal secretion jss((stom)) of gliclazide. results: treatment of healthy rats with probiotics reduced jss((mtos)) of gliclazide from 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 microg/min/cm(2) (p < 0.01) and increased jss((stom))from 0.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/-  0.3 (p < 0.01) resulting in net secretion while, in diabetic tissues, treatment with probiotics increased both jss((mtos)) and jss((stom))fluxes of gliclazide to the comparable levels of healthy tissues resulting in net absorption. discussion: in healthy rats, the reduction in jss((mtos)) after probiotics administration could be explained by the production of bacterial metabolites that upregulate the mucosal efflux drug transporters mrp2 that control gliclazide transport. in diabetic rats, the restored fluxes of gliclazide after probiotic treatment, suggests the normalization of the functionality of the drug transporters resulting in a net absorption. conclusion: probiotics may alter gliclazide transport across rat ileal tissue studied ex vivo.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to design an in vitro model system to evaluate the probiotic potential of food. a single bioreactor system-gastrointestinal tract simulator (gits) was chosen for process simulation on account of its considerable simplicity compared to multi-vessel systems used in previous studies. the bioreactor was evaluated by studying the viability of four known probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533, lactobacillus casei strain shirota, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) as a function of their physiological state. l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii survived in gits better when introduced at an early stationary or exponential phase compared to being previously stored for 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. these two species were more resistant to bile salts and survived better than l. casei and l. rhamnosus gg. the latter two species gave large losses (up to 6 log) in plate counts independent of growth state due to the bile. however, experiments with some commercial probiotic products containing lb. gg bacteria showed much better  survival compared with model food (modified deman-rogosa-sharpe growth medium), thus demonstrating the influence of the food matrix on the viability of bacteria. the study demonstrated that gits can be successfully used for evaluation of viability of probiotic bacteria and functionality of probiotic food.

TI  == the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. recent studies indicated that some lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. however, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. therefore, we examined the effects of lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (cl(-)/oh(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial  cells. postconfluent caco-2 cells were treated with the lactobacillus species lactobacillus acidophilus (la), lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, or  lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)cl uptake in base-loaded cells. treatment with live, but not heat-killed, la and lr significantly increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. similarly,  the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live la increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange. the ability of la or its conditioned culture medium to enhance cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was blocked by pi-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. corresponding to the increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity, la treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, slc26a3 [down regulated in adenoma (dra)]. the increased dra membrane localization might contribute to the increased cl(-) absorption by la. our results suggest that la secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment or prevention of atopic dermatitis: a review of the  evidence from randomized controlled trials.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. to synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment or prevention of atopic dermatitis (ad) in children, we reviewed the results of 13 relevant randomized (placebo)-controlled trials (rcts), 10 of which evaluated probiotics as treatment and 3 for prevention of ad. the main outcome measure in 9 rcts was the change in  scorad (scoring atopic dermatitis). four rcts suggested that there was a statistically significant decrease in scorad after probiotic administration to infants or children with ad for 1 or 2 months compared with that after placebo, while in two rcts scorad was significantly reduced after treatment with lactobacilli only in children with ige-associated ad. in four of these six rcts,  clinical improvement was associated with a change in some inflammatory markers. in three rcts, the change in scorad was not statistically significant between probiotic- and placebo-treated children, although in one of these trials scorad was significantly lower after probiotic than with placebo treatment in food-sensitized children. in most rcts, probiotics did not cause a statistically  significant change in interferon-gamma, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, eosinophil cationic protein or transforming growth factor-beta compared with placebo. regarding the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of ad, in two rcts, infants at high risk for atopy who received probiotics developed ad significantly less frequently during the first 2 years of life than infants who received placebo. in these studies, mothers were administered lactobacillus rhamnosus gg with or without other probiotics perinatally, followed by treatment of the infants with the same probiotics for the first 6 months of life. however, in another trial, neither the frequency nor  the severity of ad during the first year of life were significantly different between infants with atopic mothers who received l. acidophilus for the first 6 months of life compared with infants who received placebo.probiotics, especially  l. rhamnosus gg, seem to be effective for the prevention of ad. they were also found to reduce the severity of ad in approximately half of the rcts evaluated, although they were not found to change significantly most of the inflammatory markers measured in the majority of the rcts evaluated. more rcts need to be conducted to elucidate whether probiotics are useful for the treatment or prevention of ad.

TI  == rapid identification of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in probiotic products using multiplex pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and reinforce immunity in human health. recently, many functional products using the  lactic acid bacteria have been developed. among these lab, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum are frequently used for probiotic products. in order to monitor these lab in commercial probiotic products, a multiplex pcr method was developed. we designed four species-specific primer pairs for multiplex pcr from the 16s rrna,  16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region, and 23s rrna genes in lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum. using these primer pairs, 4 different lab were detected with high specificity in functional foods. we suggest that the multiplex pcr method developed in this study would be an efficient tool for simple, rapid, and reliable identification of lab used as probiotic strains.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == pediatric applications of inulin and oligofructose.
AB  == inulin-type fructans have been used in infants and children because of their prebiotic potential to modulate the intestinal flora and influence the innate and adaptive immune response favorably. a mixture of long chain inulin (5-60 monomers) in combination with galactooligosaccharides (gos) (2-7 monomers) has been added to infant formula in europe in a 10-90% ratio for over 5 y. clinical studies have demonstrated that these prebiotic formulas have significant effects  on flora composition, improve stool consistency, decrease intestinal permeability, and reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (gi) and respiratory infections and atopic dermatitis. oligofructose in weaning foods consumed by toddlers increases fecal bifidobacteria counts and decreases fecal clostridia counts during consumption, leading to softer stools and fewer fever episodes and  other gi symptoms. synergy, a mixture of oligofructose and long chain inulin, is  protective of the bifidus flora during amoxicillin treatment. few studies are available in adolescents. calcium absorption is improved especially by synergy. the same product, combined with lactobacillus rhamnosus and acidophilus, induces  significantly favorable effects on colonic ammonia (nh3) metabolism. the demonstrated bifidogenic effect of inulin and oligofructose on intestinal microbiota is probably not the only mechanism involved but may be the key to important immune mediated effects.

TI  == murine immunomodulation of il-10 and il-12 induced by new isolates from avian type 2 lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == several bacterial and immunogenic factors are involved in the host response to probiotic strains of lactobacillus. here, we report the isolation of new intestinal lactobacilli from chicken, with different immunomodulating properties  on lymphoid cells from sjl and c57bl/6 mice. analysis of biochemical markers in the lactobacillus acidophilus cba4p, cba3p, and tpa3p isolates reveal that these  bacterial isolates belong to the type 2 prototype, although they differ from each other. the effect of conditioned media (cm) from sjl- and c57bl/6-derived peritoneal macrophages incubated with the 3 sonicated bacterial isolates from chicken, as well as with lactobacillus rhamnosus 9595, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, or staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan were compared. our results show that the cm of macrophages from c57bl/6 and sjl mice treated with the cba4p isolate stimulated syngeneic splenic lymphocytes at a level similar to  the one induced with cm from peptidoglycan-stimulated macrophages. in contrast, the cm from tpa3p- and cba3p-treated macrophages promoted low or no stimulation of lymphoid cells. incubation of splenic cells with cm from macrophages treated with l. rhamnosus or tpa3p led to a relative decrease in the percentages of splenic cd4+ t cells, whereas the relative percentages of b cells increased. the  cba4p and cba3p isolates induced higher levels of gamma interferon when compared  with the tpa3p isolate. the effects of the lactobacilli isolates differed according to the mouse strain used but correlated with the production of macrophagic tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6, 10, and 12 and with the modulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk). taken together, these results indicate that the immunomodulating properties of the new  l. acidophilus isolates depend on their capacity to induce production of interleukins 10 and 12 by macrophages, which is under genetic control and depends on the p38 mapk pathway.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == efficacy of helicobacter pylori eradication taking into account its resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == the discovery of helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) provided a possibility to cure effectively patients with peptic ulcers. recent studies have shown varying susceptibility of h. pylori strains to antibiotics and increasing resistance to some of the recommended drugs. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the currently recommended eradication schemes and to assess the increasing resistance of h. pylori strains to recommended antibiotics. furthermore, the effect of probiotics (lacidofil) on the efficacy of first-line treatment with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was analyzed. the study population  consisted of 641 patients: 192 received amoxicillin with clarithromycin and proton pump inhibitor (ppi), 241 - tetracycline, tinidazole, bismuth and ppi, 53  - amoxicillin with clarithromycin and ppi supplemented with lacidofil. the efficacy of eradication treatment was evaluated by the (13)c-urease breath test.  the microbiological examination included 111 samples of h. pylori. the present study demonstrated low efficacy of the tetracycline, tinidazole, bismuth and ppi  scheme i.e. 71.4%, moderate efficacy of the amoxicillin with clarithromycin and ppi scheme i.e. 85.9%, whereas the supplementation with lacidofil significantly increased the efficacy of eradication to 94.3%. the microbiological examination revealed a relatively high level of primary resistance to clarithromycin (22.2%)  and a high level to metronidazole (46.7%), with no resistance to amoxicillin. however, the most important finding is the high level of secondary resistance to  clarithromycin and metronidazole (more than 66% in both cases). the present findings suggest the need for modification of the recommended eradication schemes.

TI  == absence of efficacy of nonviable lactobacillus acidophilus for the prevention of  traveler's diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study.
AB  == background: diarrhea is the most common illness associated with international tourism. we evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation of nonviable lactobacillus acidophilus (hereafter referred to as la) for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea. methods: we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. travelers were randomized to receive either la or placebo twice daily from 1 day before their departure to 3 days after their return. on each day of the trip and the week following the return, travelers had to record the number and consistency of stools and their adherence to the treatment. diarrhea was defined  as > or =3 unformed stools in a 24-h period. results: from january 2001 to september 2004, a total of 174 subjects were randomized to each treatment group.  half of the travelers went to west africa, and organized tours or backpacking were the most common modes of traveling. the incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the 2 groups; it was 61.4 cases per 100 person-months in the la group (95% confidence interval [ci], 44.1-85.5) and 43.4 cases per 100 person-months in the placebo group (95% ci, 30.0-62.9) (p=.14). adjustment for travel duration and other variables did not reveal any difference between the 2 groups (adjusted hazard ratios comparing the la and placebo groups were 1.43 [95% ci, 0.87-2.36] in an intent-to-treat analysis and 1.38 [95% ci, 0.79-2.39] in an efficacy analysis). conclusions: there was no beneficial effect of treatment with la for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. more studies are required to assess the efficacy of other specific probiotics (e.g., a lactobacillus rhamnosus gg preparation) for preventing traveler's diarrhea.

TI  == alteration of the canine small-intestinal lactic acid bacterium microbiota by feeding of potential probiotics.
AB  == five potentially probiotic canine fecal lactic acid bacterium (lab) strains, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, lactobacillus salivarius lab9, weissella confusa lab10, lactobacillus rhamnosus lab11, and lactobacillus mucosae lab12, were fed to five permanently fistulated beagles for 7 days. the survival of the strains and their potential effects on the indigenous intestinal lab microbiota were monitored for 17 days. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) demonstrated that the five fed lab strains survived in the upper gastrointestinal tract and modified the dominant preexisting indigenous jejunal lab microbiota of  the dogs. when the lab supplementation was ceased, dgge analysis of jejunal chyme showed that all the fed lab strains were undetectable after 7 days. however, the  diversity of the intestinal indigenous microbiota of the dogs, as characterized from jejunal chyme plated on lactobacillus selective medium without acetic acid,  was reduced and did not return to the original level during the study period. in  all but one dog, an indigenous lactobacillus acidophilus strain emerged as the dominant lab strain. in conclusion, strains lab8 to lab12 have potential as probiotic strains for dogs as they survive in and dominate the jejunal lab microbiota during feeding and have the ability to modify the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review.
AB  == vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) is a common infection affecting the quality of life of many women. probiotics have been investigated as possible agents for the  prevention of recurrences of vvc. we reviewed the available literature. in some studies the development of vvc was associated with either a low number of lactobacilli in the vagina or with the presence of h2o2-non-producing vaginal lactobacilli, although there are a few studies not supporting these statements. in addition, in vitro studies have shown that lactobacilli can inhibit the growth of candida albicans and/or its adherence on the vaginal epithelium. the results of some clinical trials support the effectiveness of lactobacilli, especially lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, administered either orally or intravaginally in colonizing the vagina and/or preventing the colonization and infection of the vagina by c. albicans, while the results of a small number of clinical trials do not corroborate these findings. nevertheless, most of the relevant clinical trials had methodological problems such as small sample size, no control group (placebo) and included women without confirmed recurrent vvc, and thus they are not reliable for drawing definitive conclusions. thus, the available evidence for the use of probiotics for prevention of recurrent vvc is limited. however, the empirical use of probiotics may be considered in women with frequent recurrence of vvc (more than three episodes per year), especially for those who have adverse effects from or contraindications for the use of antifungal agents, since adverse effects of probiotics are very rare. in any case women should be clearly informed about the unproven usefulness of probiotics for this purpose. in conclusion, despite the promising results of some studies, further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing the recurrences of vvc and to allow their wide use for this indication.

TI  == efficacy of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhoea: a meta-analysis of masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials.
AB  == to evaluate the evidence for the use of probiotics in the prevention of acute diarrhoea, we did a meta-analysis of the available data from 34 masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. only one trial was community based and carried out in a developing country. most of the remaining 33 studies were carried out in a developed country in a health-care setting. evaluating the evidence by types of acute diarrhoea suggests that probiotics significantly reduced antibiotic-associated diarrhoea by 52% (95% ci 35-65%), reduced the risk  of travellers' diarrhoea by 8% (-6 to 21%), and that of acute diarrhoea of diverse causes by 34% (8-53%). probiotics reduced the associated risk of acute diarrhoea among children by 57% (35-71%), and by 26% (7-49%) among adults. the protective effect did not vary significantly among the probiotic strains saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and other strains used alone or in combinations of two  or more strains. although there is some suggestion that probiotics may be efficacious in preventing acute diarrhoea, there is a lack of data from community-based trials and from developing countries evaluating the effect on acute diarrhoea unrelated to antibiotic usage. the effect on acute diarrhoea is dependent on the age of the host and genera of strain used.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == the elimination of ochratoxin a by lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine 29 strains of lactic acid bacteria of the lactobacillus and lactococcus genera, assessing their sensitivity to ochratoxin a and their ability to remove it from a liquid medium. it was demonstrated that most strains are insensitive to the presence of ota at the quantity of 5 microg/disc. it was demonstrated that all strains caused a reduction of the toxin amount in the liquid medium. the highest decrease, exceeding 50% of the initial ota content, was caused by the strains lactobacillus acidophilus ch-5, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum bs, l. brevis and l. sanfranciscensis. the example of  three selected strains confirmed the negative effect of the toxin on the dynamics of bacterial growth. a sharp decrease of ochratoxin a was observed during the first 15 hours of culture growth. in the course of cultivation the amount of the  toxin in the medium increased, indicating that the toxin elimination is partially reversible. a small quantity of ochratoxin a became bound to the bacterial biomass.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.

AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

AB  == leptin produced by adipocytes increases th1-dependent immunostimulation and autoimmune diseases. lactobacilli are known to promote or suppress th1 responses  according to the isolates. we have investigated whether the sensitivity of suriss jim lambert (sjl) mice to th1-dependent immune diseases, when compared with c57bl/6 mice, may be modulated by selected lactobacilli able to decrease leptin release by adipocytes. white adipocytes were isolated from both c57bl/6 and sjl mice and incubated with bacterial extracts from new cba4p and tpa3p isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus 9595 (lr), or with conditioned media (cm) from lactobacillus-treated macrophages. immunomodulation induced by supernatants of treated adipocytes was determined by metabolic activity of syngenic splenic lymphocytes. leptin produced by adipocytes, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and interleukin (il)-1beta by macrophages, and ifn-gamma and il-4 by lymphocytes were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  tests. results revealed that supernatants from cba4p- and lr-treated adipocytes decreased the metabolic activity of lymphocytes from sjl mice, whereas adipocytes incubated with cm from cba4p-treated macrophages showed no stimulation of lymphocytes. such effects correlated with leptin levels. lower levels of leptin were produced by adipocytes from sjl mice in the presence of cba4p and lr extracts. lymphocytes from sjl mice produced low levels of ifn-gamma when incubated with supernatants from cba4p-treated cells. such immunosuppressive effects were dependent on levels of tnf-alpha and il-1beta produced by lactobacillus-treated macrophages. taken together, these results suggest that the cba4p isolate reduces levels of leptin in sjl mice, leading to lower ifn-gamma production. therefore, the cba4p isolate of l. acidophilus is a promising new probiotic strain for the control of th1 inflammatory diseases.

TI  == screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  == antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  the ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. the study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (sos-chromotest for genotoxicity in escherichia coli and ames test for mutagenicity in salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (comet assay for genotoxicity in caco-2 enterocytes). a high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus plantarum. inhibition of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one l. acidophilus strain. all the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. concordance of the results obtained with  microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-two strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (sensititre anaero3; treck diagnostic systems). the upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were completed on mrs agar plates by the nccls procedure. all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the  lactobacilli were resistant. approximately 30% of the bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. none of the tested bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. single strains of bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.

TI  == amelioration of the effects of citrobacter rodentium infection in mice by pretreatment with probiotics.
AB  == background: citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring murine pathogen that causes colonic epithelial-cell hyperplasia, disrupts the colonic mucosa, and elicits a predominantly t helper 1 cellular immune response; it thereby serves as a model for the study of mechanisms of disease induced by human attaching-effacing pathogens. we sought to determine whether pretreatment of mice with a mixture of lactobacillus rhamnosus and l. acidophilus probiotics would attenuate c. rodentium-induced colonic disease in mice. methods: mice were administered sterile drinking water, probiotics (10(9) cfu/ml) in sterile drinking water, maltodextrin in sterile drinking water, orogastric c. rodentium (10(7) cfu in 0.1 ml), or maltodextrin in sterile drinking water for 1 week before c. rodentium infection, or they were pretreated with probiotics (10(9) cfu/ml) for 1 week before challenge with c. rodentium. results: mice that received viable probiotics remained healthy. c. rodentium infection elicited mucosal inflammation, epithelial-cell hyperplasia, apoptosis in the colon, and interferon (ifn)- gamma production by splenocytes. pretreatment with probiotics decreased levels of all but ifn- gamma production. conclusions: pretreatment with probiotics attenuates the effects of c. rodentium infection in mice. understanding the mechanism of these beneficial effects will aid in determining the efficacy of probiotics in preventing infection with related attaching-effacing enteric pathogens in humans.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of new probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibilities and presence of plasmids in four new probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (dr20) hn067, lactobacillus acidophilus hn017 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 (dr10), were determined. resistance to 18 commonly used antibiotics was assessed by disk diffusion. the three lactobacillus strains had similar antibiotic susceptibility  profiles to those of lactobacillus plantarum strain hn045 and two commercial probiotic lactobacillus strains, gg and la-1. the b. lactis strain hn019 had a similar profile to three commercial probiotic b. lactis strains (bb12, hn049 and  hn098). all 10 strains were sensitive to the gram-positive spectrum antibiotics erythromycin and novobiocin, the broad-spectrum antibiotics rifampicin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol and the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin, ampicillin and cephalothin. by contrast, most strains were resistant  to the gram-negative spectrum antibiotics fusidic acid, nalidixic acid and polymyxin b and the aminoglycosides neomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin. all three l. rhamnosus strains (hn001, hn067 and gg) were resistant to vancomycin and several strains were also resistant to cloxacillin. of the four new probiotic strains, only l. rhamnosus hn001 contained plasmids; however, a plasmid-free derivative of hn001 had the same antibiotic susceptibility profile as the parent strain.

TI  == pathogenic relevance of lactobacillus: a retrospective review of over 200 cases.
AB  == given that lactobacillus has been reported to be the causative pathogen in many types of infection despite debate regarding the organism's clinical significance, a literature review was conducted to investigate the treatments and outcomes of lactobacillus infections reported to date. in this article, the characteristics of over 200 reported cases of lactobacillus-associated infections are summarized. lactobacillus was found to be frequently associated with endocarditis and bacteremia. lactobacillus was also associated with a variety of other infections  including, but not limited to, peritonitis, abscesses, and meningitis. the species casei and rhamnosus were the most common. the isolates tended to be most  sensitive to erythromycin and clindamycin and most resistant to vancomycin. the species that was most sensitive to vancomycin was acidophilus. the overall mortality rate was nearly 30%. there was a significant association between mortality and polymicrobial infection (p=0.004). in the subset of patients with bacteremia, increased mortality was associated with inadequate treatment (p=0.001) and polymicrobial bacteremia (p=0.044).

TI  == probiotic bacteria stimulate virus-specific neutralizing antibodies following a booster polio vaccination.
AB  == background: orally ingested probiotic bacteria may modulate the immune response and increase antibody titers against enteric infections by bacteria or viruses. even though positive effects of probiotics on respiratory tract infections have been reported, overall only few studies have examined effects on virus infections concerning organs other than the gastrointestinal tract. aim of the study: it was the aim of the study to investigate whether and how probiotics affect the immune  response to a standardized enterovirus challenge (polio) and infections not limited to the gastrointestinal tract in healthy adults. methods: in a randomized, controlled and double-blind study 64 volunteers consumed for 5 weeks  chemically acidified clotted milk without bacteria or with 10(10)/serving (lactobacillus rhamnosus ) gg or lactobacillus acidophilus crl431 added. in the second week subjects were vaccinated orally against polio 1, 2 and 3. polio virus neutralizing serum activity, the primary parameter, was determined by the standard neutralization test (who) before and three times after vaccination. polio-specific iga, igg and igm were detected by elisas. results: probiotics increased poliovirus neutralizing antibody titers (nt) and affected the formation of poliovirus-specific iga and igg in serum. the maximum increase after immunization was about 2, 2.2, or 4-fold higher, respectively, for nt, igg or, iga, in volunteers consuming probiotics instead of placebo. no consistent difference was noted between bacterial strains. conclusions: probiotics induce an immunologic response that may provide enhanced systemic protection of cells from  virus infections by increasing production of virus neutralizing antibodies.

TI  == molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == real-time quantitative pcr assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (lab) (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. the results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to s. thermophilus and the species of the l. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that dna extraction was efficient and that genomic dna solutions were free of pcr inhibitors. for l. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of pcr quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees c for most of the strains in  this species. real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == probiotics reduce bacterial colonization and gastric inflammation in h. pylori-infected mice.
AB  == probiotics are characterized by their ability to interact with commensal microflora in the gastrointestinal tract to produce beneficial health effects. in vitro studies suggest that lactobacillus species have the potential to suppress the growth of helicobacter pylori. the goal of this study was to determine if pretreatment of mice with a commercial mixture of live probiotics (l. rhamnosus,  strain r0011, and l. acidophilus, strain r0052) would suppress colonization of h. pylori, strain ss1. thirty c57bl/6 female mice were divided into four groups: group a was fed sterile water, group b received probiotics in sterile drinking water, group c was challenged orogastrically with h. pylori, and group d was pretreated with probiotics in drinking water prior to and following challenge with h. pylori. rectal swabs, stomach homogenates, and luminal contents from ileum and colon were plated onto colistin nalidixic acid plates. serial dilutions of stomach homogenates were plated onto h. pylori-sensitive agar plates and incubated under microaerophilic conditions. tissue samples from the stomach were  analyzed histologically to determine the degree of h. pylori colonization, mucosal inflammation, and epithelial cell apoptosis. probiotics in drinking water did not affect the overall well-being of mice. lactobacillus species were excreted in stools over the entire duration of treatment. pretreatment with probiotics reduced the number of mice with h. pylori growth from stomach homgenates (100 to 50%; p = 0.02). the percentage of mice with moderate-severe h. pylori-induced inflammation in the gastric antrum was reduced with probiotic pretreatment (71 to 29%; p = 0.14). however, pretreatment with probiotics did not prevent h. pylori-induced apoptosis in the gastric mucosa. this preparation of probiotics provided a safe and novel approach for reducing h. pylori colonization and bacterial-induced inflammation of mice.

TI  == growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria, in maize porridge with added malted barley.
AB  == a fermented probiotic maize porridge with high energy density and low viscosity was prepared, using maize flour and barley malt. the porridge was fermented with  four probiotic strains (grown separately): lactobacillus reuteri, lb. acidophilus (la5 and 1748) and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains were inoculated at two levels; to obtain approx. 7 or 6 log cfu g(-1) in the porridge at 0 h. the porridge was fermented for 24 h at 37 degrees c, and analysed for viable cell count, ph, organic acids, volatile aromatic compounds and sugar content. the inoculated cell concentration was shown to be particularly important during the first hours of the fermentation period, showing a delayed production of most metabolites in porridge inoculated with approx. 6 log cfu g(-1). most strains reached maximum cell count after 12-h fermentation (7.2-8.2 log cfu g(-1)), with a ph below 4.0.  depending on the strain, lactic acid was produced in amounts ranging from 1360 to 4000 mg kg(-1). lb. reuteri metabolised succinate, while pyruvate and small amounts of diacetyl were detected in porridge inoculated with lb. acidophilus la5 and lb. acidophilus 1748. high amounts of diacetyl (6 mg kg(-1)) and acetoin (27  mg kg(-1)) were detected in porridge inoculated with lb. rhamnosus gg. porridge inoculated with lb. acidophilus la5 and lb. acidophilus 1748, contained acetaldehyde, while both lb. reuteri and lb. rhamnosus gg reduced the acetaldehyde to ethanol. lb. reuteri utilised both maltose and glucose as carbohydrate sources, while lb. acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748 and lb. rhamnosus gg utilised only glucose.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

AB  == a group of new insertion sequence (is) elements, isldl2, isldl3, and isldl4, from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 15808 was isolated, characterized, and used for strain identification together with isldl1, recently characterized as an l. delbrueckii is element belonging to the isl3 family. isldl2 was 1367 bp  in size and had a 24 bp ir and an 8 bp dr. the single orf of isldl2 encoded a protein of 392 aa similar to transposases of the is256 family. isldl3 had a single orf encoding a protein of 343 aa similar to transposases of the is30 family. finally, isldl4 had a single orf encoding a protein of 406 aa and displayed homology to the transposases of the is110 family. isldl4 was only slight different from isl4 (accession no. ay040213). isldl1, isldl2, and isldl4 were present in all of the 10 l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. delbrueckii strains tested, as well as in three of the 11 l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains tested. isldl3 was present only in four closely related strains of l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. these is elements were not observed in lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, or lactobacillus  plantarum. a cluster of is elements, isldl1, isldl2, isldl3, isldl4, and isl6, was observed in l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain atcc 15808. within this cluster, isldl4 was inserted into isldl1 between the left ir and the start codon  of orf455, encoding a putative transposase. most of the integration sites of the  is elements were strain-specific. we have observed that is elements can migrate from one strain to another as integral parts of bacterial dna by using phage ll-h as a vehicle. we demonstrate for the first time that inverse pcr and vectorette pcr methods with primers based on sequences of the is elements could be used for  identification of l. delbrueckii strains.

TI  == interactions of lactic acid bacteria with human intestinal epithelial cells: effects on cytokine production.
AB  == as a participant in the mucosal immune response, the intestinal epithelial cell must respond to a variety of stimuli, including lactic acid bacteria (lab) consumed in the diet. the objective of this study was to compare the abilities of several strains of lab to modulate cytokine secretion by human intestinal epithelial cell (iec) line ht-29. certain strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactobacillus acidophilus suppressed the production of the chemokine rantes by stimulated ht-29 iec, although the magnitude of this suppression varied depending on the nature of the bacterial growth medium. similarly, specific strains showed growth condition-dependent suppression of ht-29 interleukin-8 (il-8) production. strain-dependent effects were also seen for the suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) production. the binding of several of  these bacterial strains to the ht-29 cell line was also examined. different strains were found to have differing abilities to interact with iec, with l. rhamnosus r0011 being the strain that generally had the most extensive effects on ht-29 cytokine production and also bound to ht-29 iec most effectively. modulation of iec cytokine production has the potential to profoundly affect the  mucosal microenvironment, influencing the immune response to pathogens and other  ingested antigens.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in sos-chromotest.
AB  == antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the  tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition  (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.

TI  == assessment of safety of lactobacillus strains based on resistance to host innate  defense mechanisms.
AB  == seven lactobacillus strains belonging to four species were evaluated for pathogenicity as well as for in vitro sensitivity to the bactericidal mechanisms  of macrophages in a rabbit infective endocarditis (ie) model. two bacteremia-associated strains, l. rhamnosus phls a103/70 and l. casei phls a357/84, as well as the l. rhamnosus type strain and the probiotic l. rhamnosus strain atcc 53103, showed moderate infectivity, and the virulence of the probiotic l. casei strain shirota and type strains such as l. acidophilus atcc 4356(t) and l. gasseri dsm 20243(t) in the model was negligible. the strains that showed pathogenic potential in the rabbit ie model (phls a357/84, phls a103/70, and atcc 53103) were more resistant than strain shirota to intracellular killing  activity by mouse macrophages in vitro and also to bactericidal nitrogen intermediates, such as nitric oxide and no(2)(-) ions. these results suggest that resistance to host innate defense systems, which would function at inflammatory lesions, should be considered in the safety assessment of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, and probiotic  cell counts in fermented milk processing.
AB  == in the present work, the compared effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, growth, and stability of probiotic bacteria in fermented  milk processing, was studied. two strains of probiotic bacteria were used, lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and l. rhamnosus lr35, with two starter cultures. one starter culture consisted only of streptococcus thermophilus st7 (single starter culture); the other was a yogurt mixed culture with s. thermophilus st7 and l. bulgaricus lb12 (mixed starter culture). for the milk base preparation, four commercial dairy ingredients were tested (two milk protein concentrates and  two casein hydrolysates). the resulting fermented milks were compared to those obtained with control milk (without enrichment) and milk added with skim milk powder. the performance of the two probiotic strains were opposite. l. acidophilus la5 grew well on milk but showed a poor stability during storage. l.  rhamnosus lr35 grew weakly on milk but was remarkably stable during storage. with the strains tested in this study, the use of the single starter culture and the addition of casein hydrolysate gave the best probiotic cell counts. the fermentation time was of about 11 h, and the probiotic level after five weeks of  storage was greater than 106 cfu/ml for l. acidophilus la5 and 10(7) cfu/ml for l. rhamnosus lr35. however, an optimization of the level of casein hydrolysate added to milk base has to be done, in order to improve texture and flavor when using this dairy ingredient.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == safety and efficacy of probiotic lactobacilli in promoting growth in post-weaning swiss mice.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus ma27/6b and l. acidophilus ma27/6r are strains used in feed as probiotics. their safety profiles and growth-stimulating properties were  investigated via in vivo studies on young swiss mice. after repeated administrations of different probiotic preparations in drinking water, safety parameters determined from liver, spleen and total weight remained unchanged. the growth-stimulating properties of viable or dead lactobacilli were studied after supplementation in drinking water. the feed intake (fi), water intake and body weight gain (wg) of the animals were compared to those of control mice. the lactobacilli supplementation of a sub-optimal diet made of barley allow recording of measurable growth performance of mice. it significantly increased wg compared  to control groups (p < 0.01), by +28.9% and +31.7% for l. rhamnosus ma27/6b and l. acidophilus ma27/6r, respectively. this wg was correlated with a decrease in the consumption index. the effect of the dose ingested was also investigated: 10(8) lactobacilli cfu/mouse/day produced greater wg than 10(2), 10(4) or 10(6) cfu/mouse/day. no significant differences in growth performance parameters were observed between mice fed with 10(8) cells of viable or nonviable preparations. the mouse assay described could be used as a preliminary criterion when screening candidate probiotics for growth performance properties.

TI  == effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  == septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus,  and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.

AB  == adhesion and colonisation properties of three probiotic strains namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20, l. acidophilus hn017, and bifidobacterium lactis dr10, were determined in vitro using the differentiated human intestinal cell-lines including ht-29, caco-2, and ht29-mtx, and compared with properties of l. acidophilus la-1 and l. rhamnosus gg (two commercial probiotic strains). two independent methods were employed to quantitate the "adhesiveness" of each strain. in the first method, the bacteria adhered to human cells were detected by gram staining and counted in different fields under a microscope. bacteria were also radio-labelled and extent of adhesion determined by scintillation counting.  all three strains showed strong adhesion with the human intestinal cell lines in  vitro. adhesion indices of the three strains to two cell lines, i.e. ht-29, and caco-2 varied between 99 +/- 17 and 219 +/- 36. with mucus-secreting cell-line ht29-mtx, the adhesion indices of all the strains were 2-3 times higher. the adhesion indices of l. acidophilus la-1 and l. rhamnosus gg were comparable to the other three probiotic strains. we also investigated the inhibitory effect of  adhering strains against the intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a known enterotoxigenic strain of escherichia coli (strain o157:h7). pre-treatment of e.  coli o157:h7 with 2.5-fold concentrated cell-free culture supernatants from l. acidophilus hn017, l. rhamnosus dr20 and b. lactis dr10 reduced the culturable e. coli numbers on tsb plates and also reduced the invasiveness and cell association characteristics of this toxic strain. the inhibitory molecules secreted into the  spent media by these strains were partially affected by treatments with lactate dehydrogenase, trypsin and proteinase k suggesting that overall inhibition may be due to a synergistic action of lactic acid and proteinaceous substances.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus rhamnosus (hn001), lactobacillus acidophilus (hn017) and bifidobacterium lactis (hn019) do not degrade gastric mucin in vitro.
AB  == the mucus layer (mucin) coating the surface of the gastrointestinal tract (git) plays an important role in the mucosal barrier system. any damage or disturbance  of this mucin layer will compromise the host's mucosal defence function. in the present study, the ability of three potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, lactobacillus acidophilus hn017, bifidobacterium lactis hn019) to degrade mucin in vitro was evaluated, in order to assess their potential pathogenicity and local toxicity. the lab strains were  incubated in medium containing hog gastric mucin (hgm, 0.3%) at 37 degrees c for  48 h, following which any decrease in carbohydrate and protein concentration in the ethanol-precipitated portion of the culture medium was determined, using phenol-sulphuric acid and bicinchonic acid (bca) protein assays, respectively. the change in molecular weight of mucin glycoproteins, following incubation with  the test strains, was monitored by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). in order to expose any ability of the test strains to degrade mucin visually and more directly, the test strains were also cultured on agarose containing 0.3% hgm and incubated anaerobically for 72 h at 37 degrees c. no significant change in the carbohydrate or protein concentration in mucin substrates was found following incubation with the test strains. no mucin fragments were derived from the mucin suspension incubated with test strains, and no mucinolysis zone was identified on agarose. these results demonstrate that the potential probiotic lab strains tested here were unable to degrade gastrointestinal mucin in vitro, which suggests that these novel probiotic candidates are likely to be non-invasive and non-toxic at the mucosal interface.

AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

AB  == lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. species such as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and  lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. in food, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy  products whereas l. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. a probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in sweden in 1994. the product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. it contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of l. plantarum 299v/l. the strain l. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. in humans, l. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. it can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption  and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. l. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. the mechanisms involved need to be clarified.

TI  == chemical, physical and enzymatic pre-treatments of probiotic lactobacilli alter their adhesion to human intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  == intestinal mucus glycoproteins extracted from faeces of healthy adult subjects were used as a substratum for bacterial adhesion to investigate the effects of physical, chemical and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria on their adhesion. the strains studied were lactobacillus acidophilus 1 (lci, nestle), l.  rhamnosus strain gg (atcc 53103), l. rhamnosus lc-705, and l. casei strain shirota (yakult, yakult ltd). hereafter the strains are referred to as la1, lgg,  lc-705, and shirota, respectively. strains la1 and lgg adhered greatly whereas the adhesion of strains lc-705 and shirota to intestinal mucus glycoproteins was  low. adhesion of la1 and lgg was reduced by boiling, autoclaving and by pepsin and trypsin treatments suggesting that the bacterial protein structures are essential for their adhesion. treatment in ethanol and in propanol prior to adhesion significantly increased the adhesion of la1 and lc-705, respectively. adhesion of shirota strain was not altered by any of the treatments.

TI  == analysis of promoter sequences from lactobacillus and lactococcus and their activity in several lactobacillus species.
AB  == promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using the promoter-probe vector pnz272. these promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain lactobacillus fermentum br11 and two previously defined promoters (lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 slpa), were introduced into three strains of lactobacillus. primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. all promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. the promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host  strain. lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. the lactobacillus hexamer regions  (-35: ttgaca and -10: tataat) closely resembled those of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. the tg dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. the region upstream of the -35 hexamer of lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial up element.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == safety assessment of potential probiotic lactic acid bacterial strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, lb. acidophilus hn017, and bifidobacterium lactis  hn019 in balb/c mice.
AB  == the general safety of immune-enhancing lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (dr20), lb. acidophilus hn017, and bifidobacterium  lactis hn019 (dr10) was investigated in a feeding trial. groups of balb/c mice were orally administered test lab strains or the commercial reference strain lb.  acidophilus la-1 at 2.5 x 10(9), 5 x 10(10) or 2.5 x 10(12) colony forming units  (cfu)/kg body weight/day for 4 weeks. throughout this time, their feed intake, water intake, and live body weight were monitored. at the end of the 4 week observation period, samples of blood, liver, spleen, kidney, mesenteric lymph nodes, and gut tissues (ileum, caecum, and colon) were collected to determine: haematological parameters (red blood cell and platelet counts, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration); differential leukocyte counts; blood biochemistry (plasma total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and glucose); mucosal histology (epithelial cell height, mucosal thickness, and villus height); and bacterial translocation to extra-gut tissues (blood, liver, spleen, kidney and mesenteric lymph nodes). dna finger printing techniques were used to identify any viable bacterial strains recovered from these tissues. the results demonstrated that 4 weeks consumption of these lab strains had no adverse effects on animals'  general health status, haematology, blood biochemistry, gut mucosal histology parameters, or the incidence of bacterial translocation. a few viable lab cells were recovered from the tissues of animals in both control and test groups, but dna fingerprinting did not identify any of these as the inoculated strains. the results obtained in this study suggest that the potentially probiotic lab strains hn001, hn017, and hn019 are non-toxic for mice and are therefore likely to be safe for human use.

AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture causido(r) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. design: an 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. subjects: seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<bmi<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into  five groups. intervention: four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus (stla). group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (py). group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus (stlr). group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of enterococcus faecium and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus (causido(r) culture), gaio(r) (g). the dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. the fifth group was given two placebo pills (pp) daily. results: when comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the g-group on low density lipoproteins (ldl)-cholesterol (p=0.29). after adjustment for small changes in body weight, ldl-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; p<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; p<0.05) after 8 weeks in the g-group. this was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (p<0.05). after 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the stla and g-group compared to stlr. no other differences were found. conclusion: the causido(r) culture reduced ldl-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. the effect on ldl-cholesterol confirms previous studies. an immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain  the effect on fibrinogen in the g-group. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

TI  == enhancement of natural and acquired immunity by lactobacillus rhamnosus (hn001),  lactobacillus acidophilus (hn017) and bifidobacterium lactis (hn019).
AB  == consumption of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been suggested to confer a range of health benefits including stimulation of the immune system and increased resistance to malignancy and infectious illness. in the present study, the effects of feeding lactobacillus rhamnosus (hn001, dr20), lactobacillus acidophilus (hn017) and bifidobacterium lactis (hn019, dr10) on in vivo and in vitro indices of natural and acquired immunity in healthy mice were examined. mice were fed daily with l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus or b. lactis (10(9) colony  forming units) and their immune function was assessed on day 10 or day 28. supplementation with l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus or b. lactis resulted in a significant increase in the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leucocytes and peritoneal macrophages compared with the control mice. the proliferative responses of spleen cells to concanavalin a (a t-cell mitogen) and lipopolysaccharide (a b-cell mitogen) were also significantly enhanced in mice given different lab. spleen cells from mice given l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus or b. lactis also produced significantly higher amounts of interferon-gamma in response to stimulation with concanavalin a than cells from the control mice. lab feeding had no significant effect on interleukin-4 production by spleen cells or  on the percentages of cd4+, cd8+ and cd40+ cells in the blood. the serum antibody responses to orally and systemically administered antigens were also significantly enhanced by supplementation with l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus or b. lactis. together, these results suggest that supplementation of the diet with l.  rhamnosus (hn001), l. acidophilus (hn017) or b. lactis (hn019) is able to enhance several indices of natural and acquired immunity in healthy mice.

AB  == three potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (dr20(tm)), lb. acidophilus hn017 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 (dr10()), have recently been identified and characterized. the present study was designed to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of these strains to mice,  and also to investigate bacterial translocation and gut mucosal pathology in balb/c mice fed hn019, hn001 or hn017 for 8 consecutive days at a high dose of 10(11)cfu/mouse/day. results showed that these probiotic strains had no adverse effect on general health status, feed intake, body weight gain and intestinal mucosal morphology (villus height, crypt depth, epithelial cell height and mucosal thickness). no viable bacteria were recovered from blood and tissue samples (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen) of mice, and no treatment-associated illness or death was observed. according to these results, the oral ld(50) of hn019, hn001 and hn017 is more than 50g/kg/day for mice, and their acceptable daily intake (adi) value is 35g dry bacteria per day for a 70-kg person. this suggests that the probiotic strains hn019, hn001 and hn017 are non-pathogenic and likely to be safe for human consumption.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB  == the effects of lactobacillus strains isolated from intestinal tracts for starter  cultures of fermented sausage on the growth rate and enterotoxin production of staphylococcus aureus were studied at two fermentation temperatures of 20 degrees c and 35 degrees c. initial inoculated populations in the sausage batter were approx. 10(4) cfu/g for s. aureus and 10(7) cfu/g for the lactobacillus strain as a starter culture. samples of sausage were taken during fermentation and analyzed for ph and microbial populations. in control lots without inoculation of lactobacillus strains, staphylococcal enterotoxin was detected during fermentation at each temperature. of three intestinal lactobacillus strains, l. rhamnosus ferm p-15120 and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei ferm p-15121 inhibited the growth and enterotoxin production of s. aureus in sausages during fermentation at both temperatures, although l. acidophilus ferm p-15119 could not satisfactorily suppress them. the effect of the two selected strains in meat fermentation (i.e., fermentation time, acid production, inhibition of s. aureus)  was the same as that of a commercial l. sake starter culture for fermented sausage. these results suggest the intestinal lactobacillus strains selected in this study could be utilized as a starter culture to produce new fermented meat products that are microbiologically safe.

TI  == vancomycin susceptibility as an aid to the identification of lactobacilli.
AB  == forty strains of lactobacilli isolated from probiotic supplements or functional foods, and two clinical isolates, have been identified by api 50 chl and tested for susceptibility to vancomycin. all the lactobacillus acidophilus (16) and lact. delbreuckii (two) strains were sensitive to vancomycin, while all the other strains (mainly lact. rhamnosus, 15) were resistant. susceptibility to other antibiotics was not species-specific. differential susceptibility to vancomycin may be helpful in speciation of lactobacilli.

TI  == a microbiology investigation on probiotic pharmaceutical products used for human  health.
AB  == many and different probiotic pharmaceutical products are presently commercialised in the world. on this regard, a microbiological investigation was carried out to  screen the microorganisms incorporated into these products, commonly used for human health. after determination of the cell number and viability of bacteria, several experiments were performed in vitro in order to characterise the microorganisms and to evaluate their probiotic value. among all the strains identified, best results were obtained with lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and saccharomyces cerevisiae as far as regards growth rates, ph and bile  salts tolerance. moreover, the identification profiles of microorganisms showed a better reliability for the products containing a single species whereas the ones  composed of different strains were usually not satisfactory. in some cases, the presence of lactobacillus and saccharomyces species was in disagreement with the  claimed composition of the product and some species of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci were found not viable. in defined mixed cultures  experiments, the antagonism of lactobacillus acidophilus and enterococcus faecium versus yersinia enterocolitica was demonstrated and explained as acid and/or antimicrobials production.

TI  == development of oligonucleotide primers from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic sequences for identifying different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria by pcr.
AB  == spacer regions between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s  rrna spacer regions. also a primer pair identifying both lb. paracasei and lb. rhamnosus was designed. in addition to conventional pcr in a heat block a rapid pcr method in an air thermocycler (atc) with glass capillaries was used.

TI  == inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000  to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l.  acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of helicobacter pylori nctc 11637 by organic acids and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study the effects of both ph and organic acids on helicobacter pylori nctc 11637 were tested. lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. casei, lact. bulgaricus, pediococcus pentosaceus and bifidobacterium bifidus were assayed for their lactic acid production, ph and inhibition of h. pylori growth. a standard antimicrobial  plate well diffusion assay was employed to examine inhibitory effects. lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids demonstrated inhibition of h. pylori growth in a concentration-dependent manner with the lactic acid demonstrating the greatest inhibition. this inhibition was due both to the ph of the solution and its concentration. six strains of lact. acidophilus and one strain of lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus inhibited h. pylori growth where as bifidobacterium bifidus, ped. pentosaceus and lact. bulgaricus did not. concentrations of lactic acid produced by these strains ranged from 50 to 156 mmol l-1 and correlated with h. pylori inhibition. the role of probiotic organisms and their metabolic by-products in the eradication of h. pylori in vivo remains to be determined.

TI  == influence of lactobacilli on the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans to fibers and epithelial cells.
AB  == the ability of organisms to adhere to and form biofilms on fibrous materials is believed to be an important initiating step in the induction of several diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome. using an in vitro assay, a moderately hydrophobic strain of staphylococcus aureus (water contact angle 35 degrees) and a hydrophilic candida albicans (shown by a hexadecane test) were highly adherent to commercial diaper fibers. the lumen side of the diaper was porous and the fibers  were very hydrophobic (> 140 degrees), but the internal section was very hydrophilic (0 degrees), presumably for lus strains was present. surfaces precoated with lactobacilli inhibited staphylococcal adhesion by 26-97%, and candida by 0-67%. when the lactobacilli were used to challenge adherent pathogens, there was 99% displacement of the s. aureus and up to 91% displacement of c. albicans. hydrophobic l. acidophilus 76 (54 degrees) and t-13 (80 degrees)  were the most effective of five lactobacillus isolates tested at interference by  precoating. the moderately hydrophilic l. casei var rhamnosus gr-1 (33 degrees) was the most effective at displacing the yeast. experiments with uroepithelial cells also showed that the lactobacilli could significantly interfere with the adhesion of both pathogens to the cells. the results demonstrate the rapidity with which two pathogens adhered to fibers and epithelial cells, and raised the possibility that members of the normal female urogenital flora might interfere with infections caused by these organisms.

TI  == enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == [protein fingerprinting as a method for strain-specific differentiation of technologically useful lactobacillus strains from clinical isolates].
AB  == lactobacilli are often used in products of animal origin because of their technological properties and as protective cultures against pathogenic microorganisms, however they are supposed to be related to human infections as well. therefore 39 strains of species that are in biotechnological usage, including the type strains, and some clinical isolates were investigated. 9 strains of l. acidophilus, 7 of l. gasseri and 23 strains of l. rhamnosus were tested. biochemical and physiological properties were proved by classical tests.  analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic protein patterns was performed with diamine silver staining, a technique not previously applied to lactobacilli. classical tests were able to confirm all strains as belonging to one of the three species. analysis of protein patterns allowed to differentiate between strains of the same species. in case of l. acidophilus biotechnologically used strains and clinical isolates were clustered separately. l. rhamnosus formed three clusters.  sds-page of proteins together with diamine silver staining seems to be helpful to detect intra-species differences. it was stated, that technologically used strains of lactobacilli could clearly be differentiated from another and also from clinical isolates.

TI  == the aggregation of human platelets by lactobacillus species.
AB  == the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five  species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == two cases of endocarditis due to lactobacillus species: antimicrobial susceptibility, review, and discussion of therapy.
AB  == endocarditis caused by lactobacilli may lead to death or to relapse of infection, despite antimicrobial treatment. we report two cases of lactobacillus endocarditis in individuals with native bicuspid aortic valves who survived without relapse and review the 39 other cases reported in the literature. in only 15 previously reported cases have patients been cured with medical therapy alone. one of our patients, who was infected with lactobacillus acidophilus, was cured by medical therapy alone, and our other patient, who was infected with lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus, required surgical replacement of his aortic valve. l. acidophilus was tolerant and l. casei subspecies rhamnosus was resistant to many antibiotics tested. combinations of penicillin or daptomycin and gentamicin were synergistic by time-kill assay. synergistic therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside was effective clinically and appears to provide  optimal medical treatment on the basis of microbiological data.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.

TI  == detection of a lactobacillus substance that inhibits escherichia coli.
AB  == recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. this interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. in the present study, lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant escherichia coli hu 734 and e. coli atcc 25922. the bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain gr-1 was retained under ph buffered conditions and was bactericidal. the bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. the data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and  delayed outgrowth of the e. coli. the ability of l. casei gr-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.

AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
