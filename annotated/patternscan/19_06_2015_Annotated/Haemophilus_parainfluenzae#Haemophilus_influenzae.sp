TI  == genital carriage of the genus haemophilus in pregnancy: species distribution and  antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == recent reports have hypothesized that colonization of the maternal genital tract  with noncapsulated h. influenzae could result in neonatal invasive disease. in this study, genital carriage of the genus haemophilus was investigated in 510 pregnant women attending an italian hospital for routine controls. overall, vaginal carriage of the genus haemophilus was 9.0% (46/510). a high colonization  rate with h. parainfluenzae (37/510, 7.3%) was found; other species, such as h. pittmaniae (7/510, 1.4%) and h. haemolyticus (2/510, 0.4%), were detected for the first time in the genital flora by 16s rrna gene sequencing. notably, no h. influenzae was identified in agreement with previous investigations indicating that this species is rarely isolated from the genitourinary tract of pregnant women. no antibiotic resistance was detected in h. pittmaniae and h. haemolyticus, but quite a high degree of ampicillin (10/37, 27%) and ciprofloxacin (3/37, 8.1%) resistance was observed in h. parainfluenzae. five ampicillin-resistant isolates were beta-lactamase producers whereas 5 isolates exhibited a beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) phenotype. sequencing of penicillin-binding protein (pbp)3 revealed that the val511ala, asn526ser, ala530ser and thr574ala changes were associated with blnar phenotypes. two ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates carried substitutions in both gyra (ser84phe and asp88tyr) and parc (ser84tyr and met198leu), the other ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate had substitutions in parc, only (ser138thr and met198leu). in conclusions, about ten per cent of pregnant women carried a species of haemophilus in their genital tract. the emergence of non-beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in genital h. parainfluenzae is a matter of concern because of the risk of mother-to-baby transmission.

TI  == nasopharyngeal and adenoid colonization by haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae in children undergoing adenoidectomy and the ability of bacterial  isolates to biofilm production.
AB  == haemophili are pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria often colonizing the upper respiratory tract mucosa. the prevalence of haemophilus influenzae (with serotypes distribution), and h. parainfluenzae in the nasopharynx and/or the adenoid core in children with recurrent pharyngotonsillitis undergoing adenoidectomy was assessed. haemophili isolates were investigated for their ability to biofilm production.nasopharyngeal swabs and the adenoid core were collected from 164 children who underwent adenoidectomy (2-5 years old). bacteria were identified by the standard methods. serotyping of h. influenzae was performed using polyclonal and monoclonal antisera. biofilm formation was detected spectrophotometrically using 96-well microplates and 0.1% crystal violet.ninety seven percent (159/164) children who underwent adenoidectomy were colonized by haemophilus spp. the adenoid core was colonized in 99.4% (158/159) children, whereas the nasopharynx in 47.2% (75/159) children (p < 0.0001). in 32% (51/159) children only encapsulated (typeable) isolates of h. influenzae were identified, in 22.6% (36/159) children only (nonencapsulated) h. influenzae nthi  (nonencapsulated) isolates were present, whereas 7.5% (12/159) children were colonized by both types. 14.5% (23/159) children were colonized by untypeable (rough) h. influenzae. in 22% (35/159) children h. influenzae serotype d was isolated. totally, 192 isolates of h. influenzae, 96 isolates of h. parainfluenzae and 14 isolates of other haemophilus spp. were selected. in 20.1%  (32/159) children 2 or 3 phenotypically different isolates of the same species (h. influenzae or h. parainfluenzae) or serotypes (h. influenzae) were identified in 1 child. 67.2% (129/192) isolates of h. influenzae, 56.3% (54/96) isolates of  h. parainfluenzae and 85.7% (12/14) isolates of other haemophilus spp. were positive for biofilm production. statistically significant differences (p = 0.0029) among h. parainfluenzae biofilmproducers and nonproducers in the adenoid  core and the nasopharynx were detected.h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae carriage rate was comparatively higher in the adenoid core than that in the nasopharynx in children undergoing adenoidectomy, suggesting that their involvement in chronic adenoiditis. the growth in the biofilm seems to be an important feature of haemophili colonizing the upper respiratory tract responsible for their persistence.

TI  == procalcitonin and c-reactive protein cannot differentiate bacterial or viral infection in copd exacerbation requiring emergency department visits.
AB  == background: viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbations. whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with copd exacerbation requiring emergency department (ed) visits remains controversial. methods: viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were used to identify  the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with copd exacerbations. the bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. the peripheral blood white blood cell (wbc) counts, serum c-reactive protein (crp), procalcitonin (pct), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. results: viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of  the 72 patients enrolled. the most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza a, and rhinovirus. a total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive  bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. the wbc, crp, and pct levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different.  multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the copd exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year  period following the first exacerbation. conclusion: wbc, crp, or pct could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with copd exacerbation requiring ed visits. those with increased sputum during a copd exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.

TI  == [management of copd exacerbations: from primary care to hospitalization].
AB  == the societe de pneumologie de langue francaise defines acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae copd) as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms, basically duration >/= 48h or need for treatment adjustment. etiology of ea copd are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae,  or moraxella catarrhalis). pollutant exposure can also lead to ae copd, such as no2, so2, ozone or particulates (pm10 and pm2.5). in 30% the etiology remains unknown. differential diagnoses of ae copd include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. ae copd treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. recommended dose is  0.5 mg/kg on short course (5-7 days). during hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed. the main interest in  non-invasive ventilation is persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical management. during ambulatory management or hospitalization, clinical assessment  at 48-72 h is mandatory.

TI  == ophthalmic infections in children presenting to angkor hospital for children, siem reap, cambodia.
AB  == background: ophthalmic infections cause significant morbidity in cambodian children but aetiologic data are scarce. we investigated the causes of acute eye  infections in 54 children presenting to the ophthalmology clinic at angkor hospital for children, siem reap between march and october 2012. findings: the median age at presentation was 3.6 years (range 6 days - 16.0 years). forty two patients (77.8%) were classified as having an external eye infection, ten (18.5%) as ophthalmia neonatorum, and two (3.7%) as intra-ocular infection. organisms were identified in all ophthalmia neonatorum patients and 85.7% of patients with  an external eye infection. pathogens were not detected in either of the intra-ocular infection patients. most commonly isolated bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13), coliforms (7), haemophilus influenzae/parainfluenzae (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (2). chlamydia trachomatis dna was detected in 60% of swabs taken from ophthalmia neonatorum cases. conclusions: this small study demonstrates the wide range of pathogens associated with common  eye infections in cambodian children. the inclusion of molecular assays improved  the spectrum of detectable pathogens, most notably in neonates.

TI  == difficulties in species identification within the genus haemophilus - a pilot study addressing a significant problem for routine diagnostics.
AB  == diagnostic misidentifications of commensalic haemophilus haemolyticus as pathogenic haemophilus influenzae are frequent. this pilot study evaluates whether isolations of h. haemolyticus are frequent enough in germany to cause a relevant diagnostic problem, considering the fact that even h. influenzae is a mere colonizer in about 30% of isolations. in microbiological laboratories of two hospitals located in northern and southern germany, the distribution of haemophilus spp. was analyzed during a six-month-period. site of infection, sex,  and age of the patients was taken into consideration. a total of 77 haemophilus spp. isolates was acquired and discriminated on species level, comprising: 48 h.  influenzae, 25 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 h. haemolyticus, and 1 haemophilus parahaemolyticus. the proportion of h. haemolyticus was calculated to range between 1.2% and 16.2 % within the 95% confidence limits. commensalic haemophilus spp. were isolated from oropharynx-associated sites only. h. influenzae, in contrast, was detected in clinically relevant materials like lower respiratory materials and conjunctiva swabs. altogether, there was a low proportion of clinical h. haemolyticus isolates. accordingly, the problem of unnecessary antibiotic therapies due to misidentifications of h. haemolyticus as h. influenzae is quantitatively negligible compared with the risk of confusing h. influenzae colonizations with infections.

TI  == diversion of the host humoral response: a novel virulence mechanism of haemophilus influenzae mediated via outer membrane vesicles.
AB  == the respiratory tract pathogen haemophilus influenzae frequently causes infections in humans. in parallel with all gram-negative bacteria, h. influenzae  has the capacity to release omv. the production of these nanoparticles is an intriguing and partly unexplored phenomenon in pathogenesis. here, we investigated how purified human peripheral blood b lymphocytes respond to omv derived from unencapsulated, i.e., nthi and the nonpathogenic haemophilus parainfluenzae. we found that h. influenzae omv directly interacted with the igd  bcr, as revealed by anti-igd pab and flow cytometry. importantly, h. influenzae omv-induced cellular activation via igd bcr cross-linking and tlr9 resulted in a  significant proliferative response. omv isolated from the related species h. parainfluenzae did not, however, interact with b cells excluding that the effect  by h. influenzae omv was linked to common membrane components, such as the los. we also observed an up-regulation of the cell surface molecules cd69 and cd86, and an increased igm and igg secretion by b cells incubated with h. influenzae omv. the igs produced did not recognize h. influenzae, suggesting a polyclonal b  cell activation. interestingly, the density of the cell surface receptor taci was increased in the presence of omv that sensitized further the b cells to baff, resulting in an enhanced igg class-switch. in conclusion, the ability of nthi omv to activate b cells in a t cell-independent manner may divert the adaptive humoral immune response that consequently promotes bacterial survival within the  human host.

TI  == inhibitory effect of -ethyl-3-amino-5-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-1-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide on spp. planktonic or biofilm-forming cells.
AB  == during this study, we have investigated in vitro activity of n-substituted-3-amino-5-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-1h-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide derivatives with n-ethyl, n-(4-metoxyphenyl) and n-cyclohexyl substituents against gram-negative haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae bacteria. a spectrophotometric assay was used in order to determine the bacterial growth and  biofilm formation using a microtiter plate to estimate minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic). among the tested n-substituted pyrazole derivatives, only n-ethyl-3-amino-5-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-1h-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide showed a  significant in vitro activity against both planktonic cells of h. parainfluenzae  (mic = 0.49-31.25 mug ml-1) and h. influenzae (mic = 0.24-31.25 mug ml-1) as well as biofilm-forming cells of h. parainfluenzae (mbic = 0.24-31.25 mug ml-1) and h. influenzae (mbic = 0.49 to >/=31.25 mug ml-1). the pyrazole compound exerted higher inhibitory effect both on the growth of planktonic cells and biofilm formation by penicillinase-positive and penicillinase-negative isolates of h. parainfluenzae than the activity of commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin. no cytotoxicity of the tested compound in vitro at concentrations used was found. the tested pyrazole n-ethyl derivative could be considered as a compound for the  design of agents active against both pathogenic h. influenzae and opportunistic h. parainfluenzae, showing also anti-biofilm activity. this appears important because biofilms are determinants of bacterial persistence in long-term and recurrent infections recalcitrant to standard therapy.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis reveals distinct genotypic features of the emerging  pathogen haemophilus influenzae type f.
AB  == background: the incidence of invasive disease caused by encapsulated haemophilus  influenzae type f (hif) has increased in the post-h. influenzae type b (hib) vaccine era. we previously annotated the first complete hif genome from a clinical isolate (kr494) that caused septic shock and necrotizing myositis. here, the full genome of hif kr494 was compared to sequenced reference strains hib 10810, capsule type d (hid) rd kw20, and finally nontypeable h. influenzae 3655.  the goal was to identify possible genomic characteristics that may shed light upon the pathogenesis of hif. results: the hif kr494 genome exhibited large regions of synteny with other h. influenzae, but also distinct genome rearrangements. a predicted hif core genome of 1390 genes was shared with the reference strains, and 6 unique genomic regions comprising half of the 191 unique coding sequences were revealed. the majority of these regions were inserted genetic fragments, most likely derived from the closely-related haemophilus spp.  including h. aegyptius, h. haemolyticus and h. parainfluenzae. importantly, the kr494 genome possessed several putative virulence genes that were distinct from non-type f strains. these included the sap2 operon, aef3 fimbriae, and genes for  kanamycin nucleotidyltranserase, iron-utilization proteins, and putative yada-like trimeric autotransporters that may increase the bacterial virulence. furthermore, hif kr494 lacked a hisabcdefgh operon for de novo histidine biosynthesis, hmg locus for lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation, the haemophilus antibiotic resistance island and a haemophilus secondary molybdate transport system. we confirmed the histidine auxotrophy and kanamycin resistance in hif by functional experiments. moreover, the pattern of unique or missing genes of hif kr494 was similar in 20 hif clinical isolates obtained from different years and geographical areas. a cross-species comparison  revealed that the hif genome shared more characteristics with h. aegyptius than hid and nthi. conclusions: the genomic comparative analyses facilitated identification of genotypic characteristics that may be related to the specific virulence of hif. in relation to non-type f h. influenzae strains, the hif genome contains differences in components involved in metabolism and survival that may contribute to its invasiveness.

TI  == complications of adenotonsillectomy: a case report of meningitis due to dual infection with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, and a prospective study of the rate of postoperative bacteremia.
AB  == case report: bacterial meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy. we present a case of meningitis due to nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae after adenotonsillectomy. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that the oral cavity was the source of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. blood culture study: as bacteremia is thought to be one of the etiologies of meningitis, we prospectively investigated the rate of bacteremia as a complication of adenotonsillectomy. of the 46 patients included in the study, mean age of five years old, 11 (24%) had positive blood cultures during the operation. h. influenzae was the commonest organism grown (seven cultures), three of seven produced beta-lactamase, followed by s. pneumoniae (one culture), h. parainfluenzae (one culture), peptostreptococcus micros (one culture), and veillonella spp. (one culture). the bacteria were composed of tonsil or adenoid surface cultures in eight of 11 patients (73%). conclusions: we present a rare case of meningitis complicating a adenotonsillectomy procedure, in a three years  old boy. meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy, but bacteremia  which may lead to meningitis occurs frequently, as the results.

TI  == purulent pericarditis caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == bacterial pericarditis is a rare disease in the era of antibiotics. purulent pericarditis is most often caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or haemophilus influenzae. the number of h. parainfluenzae infections has been increasing; in rare cases, it has caused endocarditis. we report a case  of purulent pericarditis caused by h. parainfluenzae in a 62-year-old woman who reported a recent upper respiratory tract infection. the patient presented with signs and symptoms of pericardial tamponade. urgent pericardiocentesis restored her hemodynamic stability. however, within 24 hours, fluid reaccumulation led to  recurrent pericardial tamponade and necessitated the creation of a pericardial window. cultures of the first pericardial fluid grew h. parainfluenzae. levofloxacin therapy was started, and the patient recovered. haemophilus parainfluenzae should be considered in a patient who has signs and symptoms of purulent pericarditis. prompt diagnosis, treatment, and antibiotic therapy are necessary for the patient's survival. to our knowledge, this is the first report  of purulent pericarditis caused by h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae expresses diverse lipopolysaccharide o-antigens using  abc transporter and wzy polymerase-dependent mechanisms.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide o-antigens are the basis of serotyping schemes for gram negative bacteria and help to determine the nature of host-bacterial interactions. haemophilus parainfluenzae is a normal commensal of humans but is also an occasional pathogen. the prevalence, diversity and biosynthesis of o-antigens were investigated in this species for the first time. 18/18 commensal  h. parainfluenzae isolates contain a o-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster flanked  by glna and pepb, the same position as the hmg locus for tetrasaccharide biosynthesis in haemophilus influenzae. the o-antigen loci show diverse restriction digest patterns but fall into two main groups: (1) those encoding enzymes for the synthesis and transfer of fucnac4n in addition to the wzy-dependent mechanism of o-antigen synthesis and transport and (2) those encoding galactofuranose synthesis/transfer enzymes and an abc transporter. the other glycosyltransferase genes differ between isolates. three h. parainfluenzae  isolates fell outside these groups and are predicted to synthesise o-antigens containing ribitol phosphate or deoxytalose. isolates using the abc transporter system encode a putative o-antigen ligase, required for the synthesis of o-antigen-containing lps glycoforms, at a separate genomic location. the presence of an o-antigen contributes significantly to h. parainfluenzae resistance to the  killing effect of human serum in vitro. the discovery of o-antigens in h. parainfluenzae is striking, as its close relative h. influenzae lacks this cell surface component.

TI  == an application of outer membrane protein p6-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay for detection of haemophilus influenzae in middle ear fluids and nasopharyngeal secretions.
AB  == an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to outer membrane protein p6 (p6-elisa) was applied for detecting haemophilus influenzae in middle ear fluids  (mefs) from acute otitis media (aom) patients and in nasopharyngeal secretions (npss) from acute rhinosinusitis patients. p6-elisa had a sensitivity of 83.3% for mefs and 71.5% for npss and a specificity of 85.6% for mefs and 92.5% for npss, respectively. real-time pcr exhibited significant differences in the number of ompp1 gene copies among samples determined by p6-elisa to be positive and negative for h. influenzae. however, because the p6-elisa test has the reactivity in haemophilus species include two commensals h. haemolyticus and h. parainfluenzae, it is thus a weak method in order to detect only nthi correctly.  consequently, diagnosis using the p6-elisa should be based on an overall evaluation, including the results of other related examinations and clinical symptoms to prevent misleading conclusions in clinical setting.

TI  == ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == objective: ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. methods: this is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in hospital universiti sains malaysia from january 2001 to december 2010 were examined. specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on clinical  and laboratory standards institute recommendations. only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. results: a total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas  gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). conclusions:  based on the above results, knowledge of the initial gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. therefore, a  simple gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == rapid discrimination of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. haemolyticus by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and two matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) platforms.
AB  == background: due to considerable differences in pathogenicity, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. haemolyticus have to be reliably discriminated in routine diagnostics. retrospective analyses suggest frequent misidentifications of commensal h. haemolyticus as h. influenzae. in a multi-center approach, we assessed the suitability of fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) for the identification of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. haemolyticus to species level. methodology:  a strain collection of 84 haemophilus spp. comprising 50 h. influenzae, 25 h. parainfluenzae, 7 h. haemolyticus, and 2 h. parahaemolyticus including 77 clinical isolates was analyzed by fish with newly designed dna probes, and two different maldi-tof-ms systems (bruker, shimadzu) with and without prior formic acid extraction. principal findings: among the 84 haemophilus strains analyzed, fish led to 71 correct results (85%), 13 uninterpretable results (15%), and no misidentifications. shimadzu maldi-tof-ms resulted in 59 correct identifications  (70%), 19 uninterpretable results (23%), and 6 misidentifications (7%), using colony material applied directly. bruker maldi-tof-ms with prior formic acid extraction led to 74 correct results (88%), 4 uninterpretable results (5%) and 6  misidentifications (7%). the bruker maldi-tof-ms misidentifications could be resolved by the addition of a suitable h. haemolyticus reference spectrum to the  system's database. in conclusion, no analyzed diagnostic procedure was free of errors. diagnostic results have to be interpreted carefully and alternative tests should be applied in case of ambiguous test results on isolates from seriously ill patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the asia-pacific region and south africa (2010).
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and common gram-negative organisms, including wild-type enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti) in the asia-pacific region and south africa. a total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from ssti and 1251 from carti, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 aware ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. ceftaroline was very active against s. aureus (mic50/90, 0.25/1 mug/ml; 93.4% susceptible), including  mrsa (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml; 80.6% susceptible). against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) than penicillin (mic90, 0.06 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also highly active against  viridans group streptococci (mic90, 0.12 mug/ml). similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli (mic50/90, >32/>32 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (mic50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/ml) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an esbl phenotype in the region, particularly in china. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against s. pneumoniae (mic50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/ml; 99.8% susceptible by clinical and laboratory standards institute [clsi] criteria), and it was also highly potent against haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/ml; 100% susceptible by clsi criteria). ceftaroline was also active against h. parainfluenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml). in summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with ssti and carti from the asia-pacific region and south africa.

TI  == novel mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in haemophilus parainfluenzae: beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistance and inhibitor-resistant tem beta-lactamases.
AB  == objectives: to determine the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics  in clinical isolates of haemophilus parainfluenzae. methods: twenty clinical isolates of h. parainfluenzae with decreased susceptibility to aminopenicillins were examined and compared with a control group of 20 fully susceptible isolates. in this collection, the presence of amino acid substitutions in the transpeptidase domain of penicillin-binding protein 3 (pbp3), beta-lactamase production and the surrounding genetic regions of blatem genes in selected isolates were analysed. results: of the 20 non-susceptible isolates, 8 produced tem beta-lactamase (gblpar), 7 had mutations in the transpeptidase domain of the  ftsi gene related to decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams (gblnar) and 5 had  both resistance mechanisms (gblpacr). no resistance mechanisms were identified in the susceptible control group (gblnas). gblnar isolates had mic90 values 4- to 16-fold higher than gblnas isolates for ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,  cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefixime, and the most common pbp3 mutation was asn526ser. the additional ser385thr substitution (iii-like group) may confer decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, cefixime and aztreonam, as in haemophilus influenzae. in two beta-lactamase-positive isolates without pbp3 mutations, the inhibitor-resistant tem (irt) beta-lactamases tem-34 and the novel tem-182 were detected and carried by a tna transposon of the tn2 type; both isolates had an amoxicillin/clavulanic acid mic of >/=8 mg/l. the tna transposons of two beta-lactamase-positive isolates (tem-1 and tem-182) were inserted between the tfc20 and tfc21 genes, typically associated with integrative and conjugative elements in haemophilus spp.; the tem-34 irt beta-lactamase was harboured in a approximately 5.5 kb plasmid. conclusions: clinical isolates of h. parainfluenzae express a variety of aminopenicillin resistance mechanisms, either alone or in combination, including pbp3 modifications, blatem-1 and irt beta-lactamase production.

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae has a limited core lipopolysaccharide repertoire with  no phase variation.
AB  == cell surface lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a well characterized virulence determinant for the human pathogen haemophilus influenzae, so an investigation of lps in the less pathogenic haemophilus parainfluenzae could yield important insights. using a panel of 18 commensal h. parainfluenzae isolates we demonstrate that the set of genes for inner core lps biosynthesis largely resembles that of h. influenzae, with an additional heptosyltransferase i gene similar to waac from pasteurella multocida. inner core lps structure is therefore likely to be largely conserved across the two haemophilus species. outer core lps biosynthetic genes are much less prevalent in h. parainfluenzae, although homologues of the h. influenzae lps genes lpsb, non-phase variable lic2a and lgtc, and losa1, losb1 and lic2c are found in certain isolates. immunoblotting using antibodies directed against selected lps epitopes was consistent with these data. we found no evidence for tetranucleotide repeat-mediated phase variation in h. parainfluenzae. phosphocholine, a phase variable h. influenzae lps epitope that has been implicated in disease, was absent in h. parainfluenzae lps as were the respective (lic1) biosynthetic genes. the introduction of the lic1 genes into h.  parainfluenzae led to the phase variable incorporation of phosphocholine into its lps. differences in lps structure between haemophilus species could affect interactions at the bacterial-host interface and therefore the pathogenic potential of these bacteria.

TI  == summary of ceftaroline activity against pathogens in the united states, 2010: report from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance program.
AB  == the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance  program is a sentinel resistance monitoring system designed to track the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents. in the united states, a total of 8,434 isolates were collected during the 2010 surveillance program from 65 medical centers distributed across the nine census regions (5 to 10 medical centers per region). all organisms were isolated from documented infections, including 3,055  (36.2%) bloodstream infections, 2,282 (27.1%) respiratory tract infections, 1,965 (23.3%) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, 665 (7.9%) urinary tract infections, and 467 (5.5%) miscellaneous other infection sites. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam agent tested against staphylococci. the mic(90) values were 1 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; 98.4% susceptible) and 0.5 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). ceftaroline was 16- to 32-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal strains. all staphylococcus isolates (s. aureus and cons) were inhibited at ceftaroline mic values of </= 2 mug/ml. ceftaroline also displayed potent activity against streptococci (mic(90), 0.015 mug/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci; mic(90), 0.25 mug/ml for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae). potent activity was also shown against gram-negative pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis). furthermore, wild-type strains of enterobacteriaceae (non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producing strains and non-ampc-hyperproducing strains) were often susceptible to ceftaroline. continued monitoring through surveillance networks will allow for the assessment  of the evolution of resistance as this new cephalosporin is used more broadly to  provide clinicians with up-to-date information to assist in antibiotic stewardship and therapeutic decision making.

TI  == hiv-related bronchiectasis in children: an emerging spectre in high tuberculosis  burden areas.
AB  == background: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected children have an eleven-fold risk of acute lower respiratory tract infection. this places hiv-infected children at risk of airway destruction and bronchiectasis. objective: to study predisposing factors for the development of bronchiectasis in a developing world setting. methods: children with hiv-related bronchiectasis aged 6-14 years were enrolled. data were collected on demographics, induced sputum for tuberculosis, respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus), influenza a and b, parainfluenza 1-3, adenovirus and cytomegalovirus), bacteriology and cytokines. spirometry was performed. blood samples were obtained for hiv staging, immunoglobulins, immunocap(r)-specific immunoglobulin e (ige) for common foods and aeroallergens and cytokines. results: in all, 35 patients were enrolled in the study. of 161 sputum samples, the predominant organisms cultured were haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae (49%). the median forced  expiratory volume in 1 second of all patients was 53%. interleukin-8 was the predominant cytokine in sputum and serum. the median ige level was 770 ku/l; however, this did not seem to be related to atopy; 36% were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, with no correlation between exposure and cd4 count.  conclusion: children with hiv-related bronchiectasis are diagnosed after the age  of 6 years and suffer significant morbidity. immune stimulation mechanisms in these children are intact despite the level of immunosuppression.

TI  == haemophilus species
AB  == the genus haemophilus includes a number of species that cause a wide variety of infections but share a common morphology and a requirement for blood-derived factors during growth that has given the genus its name. haemophilus influenzae,  the major pathogen, can be separated into encapsulated or typable strains, of which there are seven types (a through f including e') based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide, and unencapsulated or nontypable strains. type b h influenzae is by far the most virulent organism in this group,  commonly causing bloodstream invasion and meningitis in children younger than 2 years. nontypable strains are frequent causes of respiratory tract disease in infants, children, and adults. other haemophilus species cause disease less frequently. haemophilus parainfluenzae sometimes causes pneumonia or bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. haemophilus aphrophilus is a  member of the normal flora of the mouth and occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus aegyptius, which causes conjunctivitis and brazilian purpuric fever, and haemophilus haemolyticus used to be separated on the basis of their ability to agglutinate or lyse red blood cells, but both are now included among the nontypable h influenzae strains.

TI  == construction of a novel shuttle vector for use in haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen. a number of complete genome sequences of various haemophili are available; however, functional studies have been limited by the lack of an effective shuttle vector which functions in all strains. here, we have constructed a shuttle vector, pej6, which transfers genes between escherichia coli and h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae. the vector contains an origin of replication from pls88 which is functional in e. coli and h. influenzae. in addition it contains an rp4 mobilisation region. the vector can be introduced by electroporation and conjugation into capsulate and non-typeable h. influenzae and is functional for allelic replacement and mutant complementation. the vector will be useful for investigating gene function in haemophilus spp.

TI  == [the role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  == exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of  life. approximately half of copd exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. current guidelines  recommend antibotic therapy in course of copd exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. the most common bacterial pathogens isolated in copd  exacerbation are haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. the presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. more virulent organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. atypical pathogens such chlamydophila and mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of copd exacerbation has been described in the article.

TI  == antimicrobial characterisation of cem-101 activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serogroup 19a isolates.
AB  == cem-101 is a novel fluorinated macrolide-ketolide with potent activity against bacterial pathogens that are susceptible or resistant to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b))-ketolide agents. cem-101 is being  developed for oral and parenteral use in moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. the objective of this study was to assess the activity of cem-101 and comparators against contemporary respiratory tract infection (rti) isolates. a worldwide sample of organisms was used, including streptococcus pneumoniae [n=168; 59.3% erythromycin-resistant and 18 multidrug-resistant (mdr) serogroup 19a strains], moraxella catarrhalis (n=21; 11 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus influenzae (n=100; 48 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus haemolyticus (n=12), and legionella pneumophila (n=30). testing and interpretation were performed using reference clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. cem-101 was very potent against s. pneumoniae [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic90)=0.25 mg/l; highest mic at 0.5 mg/l] and was 2- and > or =32-fold more active than telithromycin and clindamycin, respectively. cem-101 also demonstrated potent activity against s. pneumoniae mdr-19a strains (mic90=0.5 mg/l). cem-101 was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested against  l. pneumophila, with all mic values at < or = 0.015 mg/l (telithromycin mic90=0.03 mg/l). cem-101 was as potent as azithromycin against haemophilus spp.  rti pathogens (mic90=2 mg/l), with no variations for beta-lactamase production. cem-101 mic values against m. catarrhalis were all at < or =0.5mg/l. interestingly, cem-101 potency was ca. 6 log(2) dilutions greater than telithromycin mic results among 44 beta-haemolytic streptococci having telithromycin mics > or = 2 mg/l. cem-101 exhibited the greatest potency and widest spectrum of activity against rti pathogens among the tested mls(b)-ketolide agents (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) and was comparable overall with levofloxacin.

TI  == delineation of the species haemophilus influenzae by phenotype, multilocus sequence phylogeny, and detection of marker genes.
AB  == to obtain more information on the much-debated definition of prokaryotic species, we investigated the borders of haemophilus influenzae by comparative analysis of  h. influenzae reference strains with closely related bacteria including strains assigned to haemophilus haemolyticus, cryptic genospecies biotype iv, and the never formally validated species "haemophilus intermedius". multilocus sequence phylogeny based on six housekeeping genes separated a cluster encompassing the type and the reference strains of h. influenzae from 31 more distantly related strains. comparison of 16s rrna gene sequences supported this delineation but was obscured by a conspicuously high number of polymorphic sites in many of the strains that did not belong to the core group of h. influenzae strains. the division was corroborated by the differential presence of genes encoding h. influenzae adhesion and penetration protein, fuculokinase, and cu,zn-superoxide dismutase, whereas immunoglobulin a1 protease activity or the presence of the iga gene was of limited discriminatory value. the existence of porphyrin-synthesizing strains ("h. intermedius") closely related to h. influenzae was confirmed. several chromosomally encoded hemin biosynthesis genes were identified, and sequence analysis showed these genes to represent an ancestral genotype rather than recent transfers from, e.g., haemophilus parainfluenzae. strains previously  assigned to h. haemolyticus formed several separate lineages within a distinct but deeply branching cluster, intermingled with strains of "h. intermedius" and cryptic genospecies biotype iv. although h. influenzae is phenotypically more homogenous than some other haemophilus species, the genetic diversity and multicluster structure of strains traditionally associated with h. influenzae make it difficult to define the natural borders of that species.

TI  == structural characterization of haemophilus parainfluenzae lipooligosaccharide and elucidation of its role in adherence using an outer core mutant.
AB  == the opportunistic pathogen haemophilus parainfluenzae is a gram-negative bacterium found in the oropharynx of humans. haemophilus parainfluenzae is a member of the pasteurellaceae family in which it is most closely related to haemophilus sengis and actinobacillus. characterization of surface displayed lipooligosaccharide has identified components that are crucial in adherence. we examined the oligosaccharide structure of lipooligosaccharide from 2 clinical isolates of h. parainfluenzae. core oligosaccharide was isolated by standard methods from purified lipooligosaccharide. structural information was established by a combination of monosaccharide and methylation analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry revealing the following structures: r-(1-6)-beta-glc-(1-4)-d,d-alpha-hep-(1-6)-beta-glc-(1-4)- substituting a tri-heptose-kdo inner core of l,d-alpha-hep-(1-2)-l,d-alpha-hep-(1-3)-l,d-alpha-hep-(1-5)-alpha-kdo at the 4-position of the proximal l,d-alpha-hep residue to kdo, and with a petn residue  at the 6-position of the central l,d-alpha-hep residue. in strain 4282, the r substituent is beta-galactose and in strain 4201 there is no substituent at the distal glucose. these analyses have revealed that multiple structural aspects of  h. parainfluenzae lipooligosaccharide are comparable with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae lipooligosaccharide. this study also identified a galactan in strain 4201 and a glucan in strain 4282. haemophilus parainfluenzae was shown to adhere  to a bronchial epithelial cell line to the same degree as nontypeable h. influenzae. however, an h. parainfluenzae mutant lacking the outer core of the lipooligosaccharide showed diminished adherence to the epithelial cells, suggesting that h. parainfluenzae lipooligosaccharide plays a role in tissue colonization.

TI  == characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates of haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the beta-lactam resistance mechanisms of two clinical isolates of cefotaxime-resistant haemophilus parainfluenzae recovered from patients in south africa. methods: the relatedness of isolates and plasmids was assessed using pfge and restriction enzyme analysis, respectively. plasmid-mediated and chromosomally integrated bla(tem) genes and ftsi genes were  sequenced, and the plasmid-mediated bla(tem-15) was used to transform a range of  control organisms. results: the two isolates were found to be unique according to pfge, but had an identical 3.7 kb plasmid encoding a tem-15 beta-lactamase. both  isolates also had substitutions in penicillin binding protein 3 (pbp3) consistent with substitutions known to exist in beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) strains of haemophilus influenzae. the cefotaxime mics for control strains of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and blnar h. influenzae transformed with the plasmid-mediated bla(tem-15) were 1.0, 1.0 and 4.0 mg/l, respectively, compared with 16.0 and 8.0 mg/l, respectively, for the two parent h. parainfluenzae. conclusions: the high-level cefotaxime resistance in the h. parainfluenzae isolates was due to a combination of a plasmid-mediated tem-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with altered pbp3 probably contributing. other contributing resistance mechanisms could not be excluded.

TI  == sequence and functional analyses of haemophilus spp. genomic islands.
AB  == background: a major part of horizontal gene transfer that contributes to the diversification and adaptation of bacteria is facilitated by genomic islands. the evolution of these islands is poorly understood. some progress was made with the  identification of a set of phylogenetically related genomic islands among the proteobacteria, recognized from the investigation of the evolutionary origins of  a haemophilus influenzae antibiotic resistance island, namely icehin1056. more clarity comes from this comparative analysis of seven complete sequences of the icehin1056 genomic island subfamily. results: these genomic islands have core and accessory genes in approximately equal proportion, with none demonstrating recent acquisition from other islands. the number of variable sites within core genes is similar to that found in the host bacteria. furthermore, the gc content of the core genes is similar to that of the host bacteria (38% to 40%). most of the core gene content is formed by the syntenic type iv secretion system dependent conjugative module and replicative module. gc content and lack of variable sites  indicate that the antibiotic resistance genes were acquired relatively recently.  an analysis of conjugation efficiency and antibiotic susceptibility demonstrates  that phenotypic expression of genomic island-borne genes differs between different hosts. conclusion: genomic islands of the icehin1056 subfamily have a longstanding relationship with h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae and are co-evolving as semi-autonomous genomes within the 'supragenomes' of their host species. they have promoted bacterial diversity and adaptation through becoming efficient vectors of antibiotic resistance by the recent acquisition of antibiotic resistance transposons.

TI  == urinary tract infection caused by haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae in children.
AB  == there are few reports on urinary tract infections caused by haemophilus influenzae or haemophilus parainfluenzae in children. the true incidence is not known, since bacteria of haemophilus species do not grow in standard urine culture media. with the objective of investigating the occurrence and character of urinary tract infections (utis) caused by haemophilus bacteria in children, we searched the files of our uti clinic. over a 24-year period 36 children with haemophilus spp. bacteriuria were identified out of a total of more than 5,000 uti episodes. there was a significant gender difference in that haemophilus influenzae dominated in girls and haemophilus parainfluenzae in boys. with one exception, all children had important urinary tract abnormalities, such as malformation, gross reflux or bladder dysfunction. permanent renal damage was seen in 25. we conclude that growth of haemophilus bacteria in urine is associated with serious urinary tract abnormalities. the inability of bacteria of the haemophilus species to grow in standard media commonly used for culture of uropathogens suggests that the true frequency of these strains as a cause of urinary tract infections is underestimated.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the sequence diversity in a single country of a family of integrative and conjugative elements (ices) that are vectors of antibiotic resistance in haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae, and test the hypothesis that they emerged from a single lineage.  sixty subjects aged 9 months - 13 years were recruited and oropharyngeal samples  cultured. up to 10 morphologically distinct pasteurellaceae spp. were purified, and then the species were determined and differentiated by partial sequence analysis of 16s rdna and mdh, respectively. ices were detected by pcr directed at five genes distributed evenly across the ice. these amplicons were sequenced and  aligned by the neighbour-joining algorithm. a total of 339 distinguishable isolates were cultured. ices with all 5 genes present were found in 9 of 110 (8 %) h. influenzae and 21 of 211 (10 %) h. parainfluenzae, respectively. ices were  not detected among the other pasteurellaceae. a total of 20 of 60 (33 %) children carried at least 1 oropharyngeal isolate with an ice possessing all 5 genes. one  of the five genes, integrase, however, consisted of two lineages, one of which was highly associated with h. influenzae. the topology of neighbour-joining trees of the remaining four ice genes was compared and showed a lack of congruence; though, the genes form a common pool among h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae. this family of antibiotic resistance ices was prevalent among the children studied, was genetically diverse, formed a large gene pool, transferred between h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, lacked population structure and possessed features suggestive of panmixia, all indicating it has not recently emerged from  a single source.

TI  == patterns and dynamics of airway colonisation in mechanically-ventilated patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and dynamics of the microbiota in the airways of ventilated patients. seventy-four mechanically-ventilated patients were recruited consecutively, and oropharyngeal, tracheal and bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid specimens were collected 48 h after intubation, and every 72 h thereafter until the patient was extubated or a total  of five sample sets had been collected. ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) pathogens were identified, quantified and genotyped. microbial findings were highly correlated both between airway locations and over time when samples were taken no more than 72 h apart. if no vap pathogen was present in the oral flora,  it was unlikely to be found in a lower airway sample; i.e., the positive predictive value of the oropharyngeal sample was 0.73 (95% ci 0.67-0.80), and the negative predictive value was 0.95 (95% ci 0.92-0.99). colonisation with enterobacteriacae, non-fermentative bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was monoclonal in the airways and over time, whereas colonisation with microbes normally found in the oropharynx, i.e., haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, was polyclonal. when antibiotics were used, the chance of recovering vap pathogens from all sampling sites was reduced three-fold. no correlation was observed between a bacterial count of > or =10(4) cfu/ml in bal fluid and chest x-rays compatible with vap.

AB  == it is difficult and time-consuming to distinguish haemophilus influenzae from the genotypically similar haemophilus parainfluenzae, which is a commensal of the human oral cavity. the novel nucleic acid amplification technique of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), which amplifies dna under isothermal conditions (63 degrees c) with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity, was evaluated for h. influenzae detection. a h. influenzae-specific lamp primer set was designed for the outer membrane protein p6 gene. primer set specificity was validated using 4 haemophilus spp. and 13 other species. within 60 min, lamp detected 100 or more copies of purified dna with a sensitivity that  was 10-fold higher than that of conventional pcr. this method can be used to differentiate h. influenzae from h. parainfluenzae strains. thus, lamp may represent a sensitive and reliable means of diagnosing h. influenzae infection.

TI  == the soda gene as a target for phylogenetic dissection of the genus haemophilus and accurate identification of human clinical isolates.
AB  == the genus haemophilus constitutes a heterogeneous group of pasteurellaceae species, and conventional identification of isolates other than haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae is often challenging. here, simple colony-pcr and sequencing assays with the same pair of degenerate primers were used to characterize a 449- to 458-bp fragment (soda(int)) internal to the soda gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in type strains of all 15 haemophilus species and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the topology of  a soda(int)-based phylogenetic tree was in general agreement with that inferred from the analysis of 16s rrna and other housekeeping gene sequences, but allowed  more confident delineation of the main clusters of species. the soda(int) sequences showed a markedly higher divergence than those of the corresponding 16s rrna genes, and 38 independent human clinical isolates were identified by comparing their soda(int) sequence to those of the type species. except for one haemophilus aphrophilus strain, all isolates were unambiguously characterized in  spite of a high intraspecific soda(int) sequence diversity. this study provides a comprehensive sequence-based phylogenetic analysis of the entire genus haemophilus, and confirms that soda is a potent target for the identification of  clinical isolates of pasteurellaceae. this approach might contribute to the taxonomic reappraisal of this family, and to the development of diagnostic tools.

AB  == propolis is produced by bees and is reported to have several pharmaceutical properties. its antibacterial activity against strains causing upper respiratory  tract infections is particularly important: propolis might be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the bacterial infections that sometimes overlap viral infections. in this study the in vitro activity of both an alcoholic solution and a hydroglyceric extract of propolis, as well as its active principles, was tested against bacteria responsible for respiratory infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes). we also evaluated the in vitro activity of a combination of propolis and its active principles and some beta-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. our results, though not demonstrating a clearly synergistic activity between antibiotics and propolis and its constituents, show the possibility of using natural preparations, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, to enhance antibacterial therapy.

AB  == a total of 460 streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus spp. collected from respiratory infections during 2000 was tested for their susceptibility to 15 selected antibiotics. overall, penicillin resistance among pneumococci was 10.5%, while lack of susceptibility to macrolides, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and chloramphenicol reached 35.2%, 26.2%, 22.6% and 6.0%, respectively. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin were the most potent compounds (100% and 99.9% susceptible strains, respectively). among isolates of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae, beta-lactamase production (12.5% and 10%, respectively), and co-trimoxazole (19.9% and 40.0%) and clarithromycin (11.2% and 40.0%) resistance were the prevalent threats. this study confirms the  trend observed in italy since 1992: macrolide resistance among respiratory microorganisms is increasing, while several drugs including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, third generation injectable cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones remain active on the great majority of these pathogens.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe copd with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe copd, were enrolled in the study. all of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly.  patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (aecopd). three of these patients presented two episodes  of aecopd. patients with an acute exacerbation of copd received azithromycin 500  mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. in 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of aecopd with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment).  bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy  were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). azithromycin eradicated all isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. eradication of sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an aecopd is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. this finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

TI  == infection of haemophilus parainfluenzae in tonsils is associated with iga nephropathy.
AB  == we investigated the functions of tonsillar mononuclear cells (tmc) regarding whether a haemophilus parainfluenzae (hp) outer membranes antigen (hpom) enhances iga-related cytokine (ifn-gamma, il-10. and tgf-beta) production in vitro by tmc  in iga nephropathy (igan) patients. in addition, we examined the effect of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide and hpom stimulation by tmc on iga production, whether the constant region antisense to iga inhibits the production of iga in vitro by tmc. eighteen patients with igan and 25 patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct) from 6 to 45 years (mean age of 20.9 years) participated in this study. tmc were obtained from resected tonsils, and total and hp-specific iga levels, along with the concentration of tgf-beta, il-10 and ifn-gamma in the supernatant of stimulated tmc were measured by elisa. isolated tmc were cultured  with hpom in the presence of 23 oligodeoxynucleotides (odns), and the induction of total iga and hp-specific iga in the supernatant was also measured using elisa. to investigate the inhibition of iga production, tmc were cultured with hpom and antisence to iga. we found that iga-related cytokine (ifn-gamma, il-10,  and tgf-beta) production by unstimulated or stimulated tmc was higher in igan patients than ct patients. two types of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides produced  higher hp-specific iga than with hpom stimulation alone. hpom and antisence iga inhibited the production of total iga and hp-specific iga in dose-depend manner.  in conclusion, ifn-gamma, tgf-beta, and il-10 influence each other in the pathogenesis of igan, and infection by not only hp but other bacteria or viruses  which possess specific dna sequences such as cpg motifs induce the production of  hp-specific iga by tmc.

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae mitral prosthetic valve endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser.
AB  == haemophilus species are an infrequent cause of subacute bacterial endocarditis. of the haemophilus species causing endocarditis, h. aphrophilus and h. parainfluenzae are more frequent causes of subacute bacterial endocarditis than h. influenzae. h. parainfluenzae requires growth factor v (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and grows very slowly on routine culture media. h. parainfluenzae is a rare cause of "culture negative" endocarditis because it is a slow-growing organism. we present a case of a 42-year-old intravenous drug abuser with h. parainfluenzae mitral prosthetic valve endocarditis. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of mitral prosthetic valve endocarditis caused  by h. parainfluenzae in an intravenous drug abuser.

TI  == multilocus sequence phylogenetic study of the genus haemophilus with description  of haemophilus pittmaniae sp. nov.
AB  == the phylogeny of human isolates of haemophilus species was estimated based on partial sequences of four separate housekeeping genes. the clustering of each set of sequences was in accordance with speciation of the strains with few exceptions: of 108 gene fragments examined, only three appeared to have been subject to recombination events across the species barrier. housekeeping gene similarity supported previous dna-dna hybridization data for the genus rather than the phylogeny inferred from 16s rrna gene sequence comparison. the similarity of sequences of haemophilus parainfluenzae with those of haemophilus influenzae suggested preservation of the former species in the genus haemophilus. three strains representing a novel taxon were unique with respect to the four investigated gene loci. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis suggested that this taxon belonged to the parainfluenzae cluster. dna-dna hybridization data supported this generic placement. nine strains of the novel taxon were available for analysis. they were distinct from representatives of all current species of the genus haemophilus by conventional phenotypic characterization. genotypic and phenotypic data show that the strains merit recognition as a novel species of haemophilus. the name haemophilus pittmaniae sp. nov. is proposed, with hk 85t (=ccug 48703t=nctc 13334t) as the type strain.

AB  == this randomized, controlled trial was designed to show that a short, 5-day course of pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg (augmentin xr) is as effective clinically as a longer, 7-day course of conventional amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg (both given twice daily) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb). amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was designed to extend the therapeutic levels of amoxicillin in serum over the 12-h dosing interval, compared with conventional formulations, to eradicate bacterial strains for which amoxicillin mics were < or =4 microg/ml while retaining efficacy against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. a total of 893 patients were randomized and received study medication (amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg for 443 patients and 875/125 mg for 450 patients). overall, 141 patients receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg and 135 receiving the comparator formulation had at least one pathogen identified at screening. amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was as effective clinically in the per-protocol (pp) population at the test of cure (days 14 to 21, primary efficacy endpoint) as amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg (clinical success rates of 93.0 and 91.2%, respectively; treatment difference, 1.8; 95% confidence interval  [ci], -2.2, 5.7). bacteriological success in the bacteriology pp population was high for both formulations (amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg, 76.7%; amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg, 73.0%; treatment difference, 3.8; 95% ci,  -7.5, 15.0). both therapies were well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events. fewer than 5% of patients in each group withdrew from the study due to adverse events. the shorter, 5-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was shown to be as effective clinically as a longer, 7-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg, with high bacteriological efficacy and no  difference in tolerability.

TI  == population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of garenoxacin in patients with  community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  == garenoxacin (t-3811me, bms-284756) is a novel, broad-spectrum des-f(6) quinolone  currently under study for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. this analysis assessed garenoxacin population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships for safety (adverse effects [ae]) and antimicrobial activity (clinical cure and bacteriologic eradication of streptococcus pneumoniae and the grouping of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus  parainfluenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis). data were obtained from three phase ii clinical trials of garenoxacin administered orally as 400 mg once daily for 5  to 10 days for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis, and sinusitis. samples were taken from each patient before drug administration, 2 h following administration of the first dose, and on the day 3 to 5 visit. individual bayesian estimates of the fu (fraction unbound), the cmax, and the fu for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fu auc(0-24)) were calculated as measurements of drug exposure by using an ex vivo assessment of average protein binding. regression analysis was performed to  examine the following relationships: treatment-emergent ae incidence and auc(0-24), cmax, or patient factors; clinical response or bacterial eradication and drug exposure (fu cmax/mic, fu auc(0-24)/mic, and other exposure covariates); or disease and patient factors. garenoxacin pharmacokinetics were described by a  one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. clearance was  dependent on creatinine clearance, ideal body weight, age, obesity, and concomitant use of pseudoephedrine. the volume of distribution was dependent on weight and gender. patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction had, on average, approximately a 16 or 26% decrease in clearance, respectively, compared  to patients of the same gender and obesity classification with normal renal function. ae occurrence was not related to garenoxacin exposure. overall, clinical cure and bacterial eradication rates were 91 and 90%, respectively, for  s. pneumoniae and 93 and 92%, respectively, for the grouping of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and m. catarrhalis. the fu auc(0-24)/mic ratios were high (>90% were >200), and none of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic exposure measurements indexed to the mic or other factors were significant predictors of clinical or bacteriologic response. garenoxacin clearance was primarily related to creatinine clearance and ideal body weight. although garenoxacin exposure was approximately  25% higher for patients with moderate renal dysfunction, this increase does not appear to be clinically significant as exposures in this patient population were  not significant predictors of ae occurrence. garenoxacin exposures were at the upper end of the exposure-response curves for measurements of antimicrobial activity, suggesting that 400 mg of garenoxacin once daily is a safe and adequate dose for the treatment of the specified community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (er) tablets (augmentin xr, glaxosmithkline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. the bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. in clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap), amoxicillin/clavulanate er was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be  generally well tolerated. amoxicillin/clavulanate er is approved in the us for the treatment of patients with abs or cap caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus) and s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae infection of respiratory mucosa.
AB  == the pathogenicity of haemophilus parainfluenzae (hpi) in the respiratory tract is unclear, in contrast to the accepted pathogenicity of its close relative non-typable h. influenzae. we have investigated the interaction of two hpi isolates with the mucosa of adenoid and bronchial tissue organ cultures. the adherence of bacteria to the mucosa of organ cultures, the effect of broth culture filtrates on human nasal epithelium, and interleukin (il)-8 production by a549 cell cultures was investigated. hpi 4846 adhered infrequently in clusters of pleomorphic cocco-bacilli to areas of epithelial damage, mucus and unciliated cells in adenoid organ culture experiments at 24 h, but not bronchial mucosa. hpi 3698 was seen in only one adenoid and no bronchial organ cultures at 24 h. in separate experiments, hpi 3698 was cleared more rapidly from the centre of the adenoid organ culture and was not cultured at 24 h. although not adhering to the  mucosa at 24 h, hpi 3698, but not hpi 4846, caused an increase in the amount of epithelial damage in both types of organ culture. broth culture filtrates of both strains caused immediate slowing of ciliary beat frequency that progressed, and disrupted epithelial integrity. dialysed culture filtrates of both strains stimulated il-8 production by a549 cells, with the culture filtrate of hpi 3698 being most potent. we conclude that two strains of hpi varied in their adherence  to adenoid tissue, and neither adhered to bronchial tissue. these results lead us to speculate that hpi is only likely to be a pathogen in the lower respiratory tract when impaired airway defences delay bacterial clearance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == this study compared the in vitro activity of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against 381 aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens isolated from 320 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis or community-acquired pneumonia. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae accounted for 54.6% of the isolates. the ertapenem mic was < or =2 mg/l for 98.4% of isolates and > or =8 mg/l for 1.0% (all methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem had the most potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and its activity against h. influenzae and h.  parainfluenzae, all strains of which were susceptible, was not altered by beta-lactamase production. only one s. pneumoniae strain, a penicillin-resistant  isolate, was resistant to ertapenem. ertapenem was highly active in vitro against pyogenic bacteria recovered from patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == assessment of the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of rhesus macaques: moraxella, neisseria, haemophilus, and other genera.
AB  == the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of healthy rhesus macaques was surveyed for the presence of neisseria and haemophilus species, as well as moraxella catarrhalis. m. catarrhalis was found both in healthy rhesus macaques and in possibly immunocompromised rhesus macaques. several haemophilus spp. that are part of the normal nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of humans were found in many animals; these haemophilus species included h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. parainfluenzae. while haemophilus influenzae was not identified, it is possible that the identification of h. influenzae types may have been thwarted by the growth of less fastidious species. a number of animals harbored neisseria spp. such as n. sicca. however, neisseria meningitidis was not found. in summary, it appears as though the rhesus macaque may be used as a model for m. catarrhalis infections. moreover, in view of the susceptibility of macaques to organisms of the haemophilus and neisseria genera, it is possible that these animals may also  accurately model nontypeable h. influenzae and n. meningitidis infections.

TI  == the italian epidemiological survey 1997-1999. antimicrobial susceptibility data of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis in italy.
AB  == the italian epidemiological survey began a surveillance study with the aim of monitoring the antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens. from 1997 to 1999, 2028 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 523 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae were collected from 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy. in 1998, the study was extended to include moraxella catarrhalis and a total of 360 isolates were collected. there was a significant increase in the beta-lactamase production both for h. influenzae (from 5% in 1997 to 16% in 1999) and for h. parainfluenzae (from 5% in 1997 to 22% in 1999). beta-lactamase production in m. catarrhalis was 84% in 1998 and 87% in 1999. beta-lactamase production affected the susceptibility to unprotected penicillins (87% in h. influenzae, 85% in h. parainfluenzae and 34% in m. catarrhalis), and in part the susceptibility to cefaclor (about 98%). amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefixime, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were active against all strains of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and m. catarrhalis.

TI  == relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of copd exacerbations.
AB  == background: patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. stable copd patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. methods: twenty nine patients with copd (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (sd) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in  1 second (fev(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, fev(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, fev(1)/fvc 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. results: fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), branhamella catarrhalis (20%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). the presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). patients colonised by h influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. the median (iqr) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by h influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). the occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with h influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). sputum interleukin (il)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). conclusion: lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of copd exacerbations.

TI  == haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s  ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == preservation of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae at -70 degrees c.
AB  == we have studied the viability of haemophilus spp. preserved for 5 to 12 months at -70 degrees c. the following media were used: laboratoire de sante publique du quebec (lspq) preservation medium, trypticase soy broth with 10 degrees c (vol/vol) glycerol and 40 degrees c (vol/vol) horse serum (tsbg), and levinthal's broth (lb) medium. three clinical isolates of both h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae were used. after 5 months no differences in viability were observed between strains preserved in tsbg and strains preserved in lb, but a significant loss of viability was observed in strains preserved in lspq medium. no significant changes in antimicrobial susceptibility were observed after 5-month storage in any medium. after 12 months, tsbg appeared to be the most suitable cryopreservation medium for the six strains tested. we conclude that tsbg represents a good medium for the maintenance of haemophilus spp. at -70 degrees c for up to 1 year.

TI  == an epidemiological study of haemophilus influenzae at a brazilian day care center.
AB  == day care centers are a relatively new phenomenon in brazil that bring together large numbers of young children susceptible to contagious diseases. haemophilus influenzae (hi) is an important infection in the age range of those attending day care centers. in the present study, the carriage rate of haemophilus influenzae was identified in 38 day care attendees age 6 to 37 months, and 23 staff members, at a day care center in ribeirao preto-sao paulo, in 1997. to identify the carriers, two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected; one in july and one in december. the rate of h. influenzae carriers among the children was 77%. only 2 of 23 staff members (9%) had hi. among the children, there were 58 isolates in the two sampling periods; 6 of the hi were serotype b, 1 was serotype e, and 48 isolates were non-typeable. two were identified as h. parainfluenzae. one adult had a non-typeable hi and 1 had h. paraphrohaemolyticus. three of the 6 children  with type b had received a conjugate vaccine against h. influenzae type b, but they still carried this bacterium in the nasopharynx (50%). forty ribotype patterns were found among the isolates, showing a high exchange rate of nontypeable h. influenzae carriers. the results indicate that, because of the high and changing biotype of hi carriage, day care centers should be carefully monitored as potential point source of hi disease in the community.

AB  == a 453 bp fragment of infb, the gene encoding translation initiation factor 2, was sequenced and compared from 66 clinical isolates and type strains of haemophilus  species and related bacteria. analysis of the partial infb sequences obtained suggested that the human isolates dependent on x and v factor, h. influenzae, h.  haemolyticus, h. aegyptius and some cryptic genospecies of h. influenzae, were closely related to each other. h. parainfluenzae constituted a heterogeneous group within the boundaries of the genus, whereas h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were only remotely related to the type species of the genus haemophilus h. parahaemolyticus and h. paraphrohaemolyticus  took up an intermediary position and may not belong in the genus haemophilus sensu stricto. ambiguous results were obtained with seven isolates tentatively identified as h. segnis, which fell into two discrete clusters. the delineation of 'haemophilus sensu stricto' as suggested by infb analysis supports previous results obtained by dna hybridization, in contrast to the delineation inferred from 16s rrna sequence comparison.

TI  == the efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == an international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. clinical success rates were  maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). the 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating cap. at follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. the most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), haemophilus influenzae (19%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), moraxella catarrhalis (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and  staphylococcus aureus (4%). the bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. the adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. in all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of cap. bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater  than those of clarithromycin. moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

TI  == a histidine-rich metal binding domain at the n terminus of cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria: a novel strategy for metal chaperoning.
AB  == a group of cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria is characterized  by histidine-rich n-terminal extensions that are in a highly exposed and mobile conformation. this feature allows these proteins to be readily purified in a single step by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. the cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from both haemophilus ducreyi and haemophilus parainfluenzae display anomalous absorption spectra in the visible region due to copper binding at the n-terminal region. reconstitution experiments of copper-free enzymes demonstrate  that, under conditions of limited copper availability, this metal ion is initially bound at the n-terminal region and subsequently transferred to an active site. evidence is provided for intermolecular pathways of copper transfer  from the n-terminal domain of an enzyme subunit to an active site located on a distinct dimeric molecule. incubation with edta rapidly removes copper bound at the n terminus but is much less effective on the copper ion bound at the active site. this indicates that metal binding by the n-terminal histidines is kinetically favored, but the catalytic site binds copper with higher affinity. we suggest that the histidine-rich n-terminal region constitutes a metal binding domain involved in metal uptake under conditions of metal starvation in vivo. particular biological importance for this domain is inferred by the observation that its presence enhances the protection offered by periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase toward phagocytic killing.

TI  == bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2000: a state-of-the-art review.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is the fourth leading cause of death in the united states. the precise role of bacterial infection in the course and pathogenesis of copd has been a source of controversy for decades. chronic bacterial colonization of the lower airways contributes to airway inflammation; more research is needed to test the hypothesis that this bacterial colonization accelerates the progressive decline in lung function seen in copd (the vicious circle hypothesis). the course of copd is characterized by intermittent exacerbations of the disease. studies of samples obtained by bronchoscopy with the protected specimen brush, analysis of the human immune response with appropriate immunoassays, and antibiotic trials reveal that approximately half of exacerbations are caused by bacteria. nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causes of exacerbations, while chlamydia pneumoniae causes a small proportion. the role of  haemophilus parainfluenzae and gram-negative bacilli remains to be established. recent progress in studies of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of infection in the human respiratory tract and in vaccine development guided by such studies promises to lead to novel ways to treat and prevent bacterial infections in copd.

TI  == absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  == following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority  of patients. the objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical  dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. prior  to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. in these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were  identified: streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), haemophilus influenzae (two), and serratia marcescens (one). eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. in three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. in two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of streptococcus viridans and one case of haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. in four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. the authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.

AB  == we developed and evaluated a pcr-based-restriction endonuclease analysis method to detect and analyze the tonb gene of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae from pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. multiple sites from the same patient, including the surface of adenoids and tonsils, as well as the core of tonsils, were cultured on chocolate  agar and identified using standard procedures and the api nh kit. a total of 55 h. influenzae isolates were recovered from different sites of 20 patients, and 32 h. parainfluenzae isolates were recovered from various sites of 12 patients. dna  was extracted from american type culture collection strains and test isolates by  the puregene kit. two primers, g1 (21-mer) and g2 (23-mer), were designed by us to amplify by pcr the tonb gene that consists of an 813-bp fragment. a nested pcr using primers t1 (23-mer) and t2 (24-mer) that flank an internal sequence to the  gene of the order of 257 bp and restriction endonuclease digestion using xhoi and bglii were done to detect whether heterogeneity within the gene exists between the two species. reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) was finally done to detect transcription of the gene in both species. our data have shown that the tonb gene was detected in both species. it is known to encode a virulent protein, tonb, in  h. influenzae; however, demonstration of its presence in h. parainfluenzae is novel. nested-pcr and restriction endonuclease analysis have shown that the tonb  gene is apparently structurally the same in both species, with possible differences that may exist in certain h. parainfluenzae isolates. rt-pcr done on  selected numbers of h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae have shown that the tonb  gene was transcribed in both species. this shows that the tonb protein, if expressed, may play a different role in the virulence in h. parainfluenzae since  it is not needed for heme or heme complexes uptake as with h. influenzae.

AB  == haemophilus bacteria are normally present in the upper respiratory tract of healthy individuals. however, these bacteria could be opportunistic pathogens especially in children. the present study was conducted to determine beta-lactamase activity of haemophilus from the throat cultures of children with  upper respiratory tract infections. 154 haemophilus strains were isolated from throat swabs of 208 children whom had upper respiratory tract infections. among the 154 haemophilus strains isolated, 117 h. influenzae (76%), 35 h. parainfluenzae (22.7%), and two h. aphrophilus (13%) were identified by api nh. beta-lactamase activity was positive in 42 isolates of 117 h. influenzae isolates, while it was negative in 75 isolates. beta-lactamase activity was positive in 20 h. parainfluenzae isolates, and negative in 15. all the h. aphrophilus isolates were beta-lactamase negative. it is known that beta-lactamase positive haemophilus bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics. therefore, the antibiotic resistance of haemophilus was further investigated in relation to beta-lactamase activity. the in vitro antibacterial susceptibilities  of haemophilus strains for ampicillin, sulbactam-ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin were tested by disk diffusion method on chocolate agar. in 42 beta-lactamase-positive  h. influenzae isolates, 32 isolates were resistant against ampicillin. in 20 beta-lactamase-positive h. parainfluenzae isolates, 16 were resistant against ampicillin. the two beta-lactamase negative h. aphrophilus were sensitive to ampicillin. biotypes and serotypes were also investigated. biotypes of h. influenzae strains were as follows: 40 strains biotype ii, 25 strains biotype i,  14 strains biotype iii, and 38 strains biotypes vii, viii, v, and iv. biotypes of 35 h. parainfluenzae strains were: 6 strains biotype iii, 5 strains biotype i, 5  strains biotype iv. biotypes of remaining 19 isolates were ii, viii, vi and vii.  the serotypes of h. influenzae strains were determined by specific antiserums. serotypes of 117 h. influenzae found were type a, b, c, d, and f.

TI  == airway inflammation and etiology of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == study objectives: the etiologic role of bacterial pathogens isolated from sputum  culture in 40 to 50% of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) is controversial. if bacterial pathogens cause these aecb, they should be associated with greater neutrophilic airway inflammation than pathogen-negative exacerbations. design: this hypothesis was tested by comparing levels of interleukin (il)-8, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and neutrophil elastase (ne) in 81 sputum samples obtained from 45 patients with aecb. four groups were compared. in the first three groups, nontypable haemophilus influenzae (n = 20),  haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 27), and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 14) were isolated as sole pathogens, respectively. in the fourth group, only normal flora  was isolated (n = 20). paired samples, obtained from individual patients at different times, that differed in their culture results were also compared. setting: an outpatient research clinic at a veterans affairs medical center. patients: these patients were participating in a prospective, longitudinal study  of the dynamics of bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis, for which they were seen in the study clinic on a monthly basis as well as when they were experiencing symptoms suggestive of aecb. interventions: none. measurements and results: h influenzae exacerbations were associated with significantly higher sputum il-8, tnf-alpha, and ne. m catarrhalis exacerbations demonstrated significantly higher sputum tnf-alpha and ne when compared to pathogen-negative exacerbations. h parainfluenzae-associated exacerbations had an inflammatory profile similar to pathogen-negative exacerbations. sputum elastase level distinguished bacterial from nonbacterial aecb and correlated with clinical severity of the aecb. conclusions: increased airway inflammation associated with  isolation of h influenzae and m catarrhalis supports an etiologic role of these pathogens in aecb.

TI  == distribution of diaminopropane, putrescine and cadaverine in haemophilus and actinobacillus.
AB  == cellular levels of diaminopropane, putrescine and cadaverine, and decarboxylase activities to produce these diamines in six species (16 strains) of haemophilus and four species (5 strains) of actinobacillus belonging to the family pasteurellaceae of the gamma subclass of the class proteobacteria, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). diaminopropane was ubiquitously distributed within all haemophilus and actinobacillus species, and l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid decarboxylase activity was detected in them. putrescine and ornithine decarboxylase activity were found in h. aphrophilus, h. parainfluenzae and h. influenzae (type a, b, d, e and f except for type c) but not detected in h. aegyptius, h. parahaemolyticus, h. ducreyi and actinobacillus  species. cadaverine occurred in h. aphrophilus, h. aegyptius, h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. equuli and a. lignieresii, whereas their lysine decarboxylase activity was scarcely detected. cadaverine was not found in h. parahaemolyticus, h. ducreyi and a. suis. the diamine profile serves  as a phenotypic marker for the chemotaxonomic classification of the family pasteurellaceae.

AB  == to compare the efficacy and safety of five-day cefdinir treatment with seven-day  loracarbef treatment in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis,  586 patients were enrolled in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial. patients received either five days of treatment with cefdinir (n = 291) at 300 mg twice daily or seven days of treatment with loracarbef (n = 295) at 400 mg twice  daily. microbiological assessments were done on sputum specimens obtained at admission and at the two post-therapy visits, if available. the clinical cure rates were 86% (138/160) and 85% (141/166) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and loracarbef, respectively. respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 457 (78%) of 586 admission sputum specimens, with the predominant pathogens being haemophilus parainfluenzae, h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis  and staphylococcus aureus. the microbiological eradication rates at the test-of-cure visit were 88% (193/219 pathogens) and 90% (227/251 pathogens) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and loracarbef, respectively. adverse event rates while on treatment were 30% and 21% for cefdinir- and loracarbef-treated patients, respectively. these results indicate that a five-day regimen of cefdinir is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

TI  == do bacteria cause exacerbations of copd?
AB  == exacerbations of copd, which include combinations of dyspnea, cough, wheezing, increased sputum production (and a change in its color to green or yellow), are common. the role of bacterial infection in causing these episodes and the value of antibiotic therapy for them are debated. an assessment of the microbiological  studies indicates that conventional bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, are absent in about 50% of attacks. the frequency of isolating these organisms, which often colonize the bronchi of patients in stable condition, does not seem to increase during exacerbations, and their density typically remains unchanged. serologic studies generally fail to show rises in antibody titers to h influenzae; the only report  available demonstrates none to haemophilus parainfluenzae; and the sole investigation of s pneumoniae is inconclusive. trials with vaccines against s pneumoniae and h influenzae show no clear benefit in reducing exacerbations. the  histologic findings of bronchial biopsies and cytologic studies of sputum show predominantly increased eosinophils, rather than neutrophils, contrary to what is expected with bacterial infections. the randomized, placebo-controlled trials generally show no benefit for antibiotics, but most have studied few patients. a  meta-analysis of these demonstrated no clinically significant advantage to antimicrobial therapy. the largest trials suggest that antibiotics confer no advantage for mild episodes; with more severe attacks, in which patients should receive systemic corticosteroids, the addition of antimicrobial therapy is probably not helpful.

TI  == induction of iga against haemophilus parainfluenzae antigens in tonsillar mononuclear cells from patients with iga nephropathy.
AB  == much evidence suggests that iga production in vivo and in vitro is enhanced in patients with iga nephropathy (igan). we have demonstrated glomerular deposition  of the outer membranes of haemophilus parainfluenzae (hp) antigens (omhp) and the presence of hp-specific iga in the serum of patients with igan. in this study, we investigated the production of iga and several cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells (tmc) from igan patients induced by stimulation with omhp. the spontaneous  production of total iga and tgf-beta by tmc from igan patients was higher than that by tmc from patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct) (p < 0.05). stimulation with omhp in vitro enhanced the production of hp-specific iga by tmc from igan patients (p < 0.01), but not by tmc from ct patients. omhp stimulation also enhanced the production of tgf-beta and il-10 by tmc from igan patients (p < 0.001). these results suggest that the infection of hp in the tonsil may be involved in the etiology of igan.

TI  == epidemiological studies of large resistance plasmids in haemophilus.
AB  == the distribution of large conjugative haemophilus influenzae plasmids in the nasopharyngeal haemophili of a group of people and in a large collection of 541 h. influenzae type b (hib) isolates was studied. a newly developed pcr-based assay was used to detect the plasmids. the target sequences were chosen from sequence analysis of part of p1056, a large multiresistance plasmid isolated from a clinical hib isolate, 1056. fifty-nine per cent of people were found to carry beta-lactamase-positive (beta-lac(+)), ampicillin-resistant (ampr) haemophili with detectable plasmid sequences. of these, 83% were in haemophilus parainfluenzae and 17% were in h. influenzae. in the collection of 541 hib, antibiotic resistance [beta-lac(+)ampr, beta-lac(+)ampr plus tetracycline resistance (tetr) or tetr] was highly correlated with large plasmids. it was found that 2.3% of the isolates contained large cryptic plasmids (i.e. these isolates were susceptible to antibiotics). the distribution of plasmids between invasive and carried hib did not differ significantly (25 of 245 and 23 of 276, respectively). isolates with large plasmids occur at high frequency in the nasopharynx of the normal human population and consist of two populations in hib, one associated with specific antibiotic resistance traits and the other cryptic.  these plasmids do not appear to influence the invasiveness of hib.

TI  == respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  == although most respiratory tract infections (rti) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with rti must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of s. pneumoniae from france and spain. uniquely, in italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. in 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 european countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. the mic(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of s. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/l, the mics for only five strains being >2  mg/l, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/l. the mic(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of h. influenzae and  323 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of m. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/l. the mic(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of legionella pneumophila (mic(90) 0.015 mg/l), mycoplasma pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and chlamydia pneumoniae (mics 0.06-0.12 mg/l). current susceptibility data indicate  that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in european countries. the enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of s. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of rti.

AB  == objective: to inform the isolation and antibiotics susceptibility results of haemophilus in the sputum of old men suffering from respiratory tract disease so  that the epidemiological information and treatment can be available to physicians. methods: two groups-group a, patients=562, group b, healthy volunteers=57 expectorated specimens of sputum were cultured with a special medium for haemophilus. the isolates were then identified with api nh identification plates and detected with atb nh antibiotics susceptibility cards,  finally, we got the statistics data of haemophilus species and antibiotics susceptibility rates from datatrac statistic system of vitek 32. results: haemophilus were detected in 132 specimens out of 562 (23.5%), which includes 6 strains of h. influenzae (4.5%). 122 strains of h. parainfluenzae, 4 strains of h. aphrophilus (3.1%). at the same time, 3 strains of haemophilus were isolated from group b. following are the susceptibility rates of sixteen antibiotics of 132 strains of haemophilus, 73.4% to amoxicillin, 92.4% to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, 83.3% to cefactor, 90.9% to cefotaxime, 79.5% to cefuroxime-axetil, 52.3% to kanamycin, 25.0% to gentamycin, 72.0% to spectinomycin, 79.5% to chloramphenicol, 50.0% to tetracycline, 9.1% to erythromycin, 42.4% to pristhomycin, 49.2% to rosoxacin, 62.96% to pefloxacin, 97.7% to rifampin, 33.3% to sulfonamides. conclusion: there is a high isolation rate of haemophilus in the sputum of the elderly suffering from respiratory tract diseases, the h. parainfluenzae is the main haemophilus in our area of study, which it deserves good attention by clinical microbiological laboratory. in addition, the antibiotics susceptibility results indicate that this species is more susceptible to beta-lactams antibiotics and is less susceptible to some others such as macrolides and aminoglycosides, etc. so, the drug treatment should be based on these antibiotics susceptibility results in order to guide the specific therapy.

TI  == immune response to haemophilus parainfluenzae in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.
AB  == haemophilus parainfluenzae is often isolated from the sputa of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. we have investigated the immune response to this organism in patients with chronic bronchitis (n = 3) and bronchiectasis (n = 10) and in healthy controls (n = 9). outer membrane proteins (omps) of h. parainfluenzae were purified for use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent and immunoblot assays. whole-cell h. parainfluenzae preparations were used to adsorb  antibodies from serum samples, which were subsequently immunoblot assayed to investigate the antibody response to surface-exposed epitopes. levels of h. parainfluenzae-specific immunoglobulin g (igg), but not iga or igm, were increased in the sera of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease compared  to levels in control subjects. the species specificity of the antibody response was confirmed, although a degree of cross-reactivity with h. influenzae antigens  was observed. iga and igg specific for omps of h. parainfluenzae were demonstrated to be present in the sputa and sera of five patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. variation in the pattern and intensity of antigen recognition was observed among patients and among immunoglobulin classes. omps of approximately 36, 22, and 15 kda were confirmed to possess epitopes exposed on the surface of intact h. parainfluenzae. we have demonstrated the presence of a species-specific systemic immune response to h. parainfluenzae in colonized patients. a specific antibody response was also observed in sputum, and the antigen specificity of these responses in patients with chronic obstructive lung  disease was investigated for the first time. the presence of a specific immune response suggests that h. parainfluenzae may have a pathogenic role in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.

TI  == [haemophilus parainfluenzae and iga nephropathy].
AB  == iga nephropathy (igan) was first reported by berger in 1968, and characterized by diffuse iga deposition in the mesangium. patients with igan have usually episodic macroscopic hematuria accompanied with pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, bronchitis,  or sinusitis. these findings suggest that igan is an immune-complex disease resulting from a poorly controlled mucosal immune response to environmental antigens to which the patient was chronically exposed. we reported the glomerular deposition of the outer membrane of haemophilus parainfluenzae (omhp) antigens and the presence of iga antibody against omhp in the sera of patients with igan.  these suggest that haemophilus parainfluenzae plays a role in the aetiology of this disease. this study was conducted to determine whether omhp antigens induced immunohistologically evident glomerular deposition of iga and c3 in c3h/hen mice. female c3h/hen mice (4 weeks old) received intraperitoneal injection (hp-ip group), and oral administration (hp-po group) of omhp antigens. the control group similarly received intraperitoneal injection of pbs, and oral intake of ordinary  water. the mice were sacrificed at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 weeks after the start of the experiment. the hp-ip group showed glomerular deposition of iga, c3 and omhp  antigens, glomerular changes (mesangial hypercellularity and increase in mesangial matrix) after 20 weeks. the hp-po group showed only mild deposition of  iga, and mild increase in mesangial matrix. these results suggest that omhp antigens play a role in the glomerular deposition of iga and c3 in c3h/hen mice.  this is the first use of omhp antigens to establish an active model of igan.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae localized in epithelial cell layers is shielded from antibiotics and antibody-mediated bactericidal activity.
AB  == nonencapsulated haemophilus influenzae frequently persists in the lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and cystic fibrosis (cf) patients for prolonged periods of time. the bacteria are not eradicated by antibiotic treatment of the patients or by specific antibodies that are found in the sputum  and sera of these patients. we investigated whether h. influenzae, when localized in lung epithelial cell layers, is shielded from antibiotics and from antibody-mediated bactericidal activity of specific antibodies. an in vitro model system consisting of lung epithelial nci-h292 cells on permeable supports was developed to allow long term association of h. influenzae with the cells. microscopic examination showed increasing numbers of h. influenzae bacteria between the epithelial cells up to 24 h of incubation. coinciding with the microscopic observations the maximum number of cell-associated bacteria surviving gentamicin treatment of the cell layers was obtained after 24 h of incubation. all h. influenzae strains, and one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain tested penetrated into the cell layer as determined by gentamicin killing. cell-associated bacteria were shielded from the bactericidal activity of several  antibiotics and from antibody-mediated bactericidal activity. after prolonged incubation in the cell system in the presence of a specific bactericidal antibody against major outer membrane protein (momp) p2, antigenic variation occurred due  to a point mutation in the momp p2 gene, similar to point mutations observed in vivo. we conclude that penetration of h. influenzae between lung epithelial cells results in shielding the bacteria from killing by antibody dependent defense mechanisms and by antibiotics. therefore, penetration of h. influenzae between epithelial cells may contribute to the persistence of this microorganism in copd  and cf patients.

TI  == management of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in chronic bronchitis, a common respiratory illness marked by chronic productive  cough and caused largely by cigarette smoking, bacterial exacerbations are thought to be a common cause of progressive airway damage. common bacterial pathogens, found in 50% to 60% of episodes, include haemophilus influenzae (the most common), as well as haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. bacterial resistance to antibiotics, especially beta-lactam drugs such as amoxicillin, is increasingly common in these pathogens. in this illness, clinical risk stratification based on age, history and comorbidity is an important strategy. patients in the lowest risk group likely have viral infections and require no specific treatment. patients in the higher risk groups require aggressive treatment to avoid treatment failure, which can lead to prolonged hospitalization and complications. preventive therapies (smoking cessation and influenza vaccination) are worthwhile measures for these patients.

AB  == three hundred eighty-nine patients were enrolled in a double-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and safety of a 5-day course (n = 195) versus a 10-day course (n = 194) of grepafloxacin 400 mg once daily in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abecb). patients in the 5-day treatment group received placebo on days 6 through 10. bacteriologic assessments were based on cultures of sputum specimens obtained before and, when possible, during and after treatment.  organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 332 of 388 (86%) patients, the primary pathogens being haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus (29%, 19%, 4%, 5%, and 5% of isolates, respectively). among isolates tested for beta-lactamase production, results were positive in 25% of h  influenzae isolates and 90% of m catarrhalis isolates. forty-two percent of s pneumoniae isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility (intermediate or high-level resistance) to penicillin. a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 83% (128 of 155) and 81% (122 of 150) of clinically  evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 or 10 days, respectively. pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated in 77% (106 of 138) and 80% (98  of 123) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5  or 10 days, respectively. the 2 treatment groups were equivalent with respect to  both clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, and no statistically significant differences in the incidence of drug-related adverse events were seen between the 2 groups. substantial symptom relief was evident with both treatment regimens by  the first during-treatment measurement, which occurred between days 3 through 5.  these results indicate that treatment with 400 mg grepafloxacin once daily for 5  days is as well tolerated and effective as treatment for 10 days in patients with abecb. the lower cost compared with a 10-day regimen and the increased likelihood that patients will complete the entire shorter, once-daily regimen make the 5-day grepafloxacin regimen a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of abecb.

TI  == efficacy and safety of high dose intravenous ciprofloxacin in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. italian ciprofloxacin study group.
AB  == one hundred and fifty three hospitalized patients were enrolled in an open, prospective, multi-center study on the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg i.v., b.i.d.) for acute bacterial pneumonia: 93 (63%) patients were valid for efficacy out of 148 valid for intention-to-treat analysis. the most commonly isolated organisms from 93 valid-for-efficacy patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae (17%), streptococcus aureus (14%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11%). cure was achieved in 89/93 (95.7%) valid-for-efficacy patients; effective  eradications were obtained in 42 (45%) and presumed eradications in 48 (52%) of the 93 patients. mild or moderate adverse events (ae) occurred in 13/153 (8.5%) patients assessable for safety; all but one ae were rapidly reversible and only one treatment-stop (0.65%) was decided. the treatment of acute bacterial pneumonias with high-dose parenteral ciprofloxacin appears to be efficacious and  well tolerated.

TI  == etiology, susceptibility, and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of complicated chronic bronchitis in the primary care setting: ciprofloxacin 750 mg  b.i.d. versus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. bronchitis study group.
AB  == although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) appears beneficial in patients with a  history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. in a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (cip) 750 mg and clarithromycin (cla) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with aecb  (1083 cip, 1097 cla). patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe aecb episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for aecb within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. the majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). mean patient age was 62 years. a history of at least three aecb episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of cip-treated patients and 53% of cla-treated patients. of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included haemophilus species, 28%; moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; enterobacteriaceae, 18%; staphylococcus aureus, 17%; streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of haemophilus influenzae, 10% of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of m catarrhalis isolates. thirty-four percent of s pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/l). among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for cip versus 90% and 96% for cla. the differences between cip and cla did not reach statistical significance. superinfections were  reported significantly more frequently in cla-treated (3%) versus cip-treated patients (1%). eradication rates for specific organisms for cip and cla, respectively, were haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; m catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; s pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of cip-treated patients and 10% of cla-treated patients. cip 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than cla 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe aecb. the causative bacterial pathogens of aecb appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with aecb should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [selection of antibacterial therapy for treatment of infections in elderly patients].
AB  == examination of 60 elderly outpatients with lower respiratory tract infections (lrti) revealed that 73 per cent of the patients isolated the pathogen associations and only 27 per cent isolated the monocultures. grampositive cocci including streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from 70 per cent of the patients, haemophilus influenzae and h.parainfluenzae were isolated from 20 per cent of the patients and acinetobacter spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., proteus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginsa were isolated from 10 per cent of the patients. the patients were treated with ciprofloxacin, cefaclor or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. ciprofloxacin proved to be the most efficient agent. the regimens of the ofloxacin use in a dose of 400 mg orally once a day or in a dose of 200 mg intravenously twice a day for 2-4 days followed by the oral use for 6-8 days in the treatment of 24 patients with lrti hospitalized into a therapeutic unit were compared. it was shown (pharmacokinetically as well) that the regiment with the drug use in the single dose was more efficient. lomefloxacin was suggested to be the most advantageous drug in the treatment of elderly patients with lrti because of its easy use, practically no dependence of  the pharmacokinetics on the patient age and almost no nephrotoxic action.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of haemophilus parainfluenzae from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.
AB  == this study was undertaken to characterize serial haemophilus parainfluenzae strains from epidemiologically unrelated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients and from healthy carriers. a comprehensive approach was used including different phenotypical and molecular typing methods: biotyping, antibiotyping, conventional ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) assay, and pcr-ribotyping. conventional ribotyping and pfge analysis were confirmed as excellent procedures to differentiate isolates of the same species and biotype. conversely, in our study, pcr-ribotyping proved to be suitable for taxonomic purposes, unambiguously identifying h. parainfluenzae from h. influenzae but not discriminating strains at the intraspecific level for epidemiological typing. phylogenetic analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) data of sequences related to the rrn operon demonstrated that h. parainfluenzae strains associated to copd are spread among many diverging lineages.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a 16s/23s ribosomal spacer from haemophilus parainfluenzae reveals an invariant, mosaic-like organisation of sequence blocks.
AB  == a 16s/23s ribosomal spacer from a haemophilus parainfluenzae rrn locus was cloned and sequenced. analysis of pcr-amplified genomic fragments showed that this region is strongly conserved among unrelated isolates; computer analysis of database homologies showed that the spacer consists of sequence blocks, arranged  in a mosaic-like structure, with strong homologies with analogous blocks present  in the spacer regions of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus ducreyi and actinobacillus spp. it also contains a trna(glu) gene, which is highly homologous to trna(glu) genes found in spacers of other species. these data strongly support the hypothesis that recombination events are involved in the organisation of the  sequence of the spacer, as a result of horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  == the orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. because widespread antibiotic use  is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. using the e-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were  determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately  700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. the results demonstrated that > 90% of haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the nccls interpretive breakpoints. mic distributions  showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.

TI  == photodynamic destruction of haemophilus parainfluenzae by endogenously produced porphyrins.
AB  == bacterial resistance against antibiotic treatment is becoming an increasing problem in medicine. therefore methods to destroy microorganisms by other means are being investigated, one of which is photodynamic therapy (pdt). it has already been shown that a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can be killed in vitro by pdt using exogenous sensitizers. an alternative method of photosensitizing cells is to stimulate the production of endogenous sensitizers.  the purpose of this study was to investigate the bactericidal efficacy of pdt for haemophilus parainfluenzae with endogenously produced porphyrins, synthesized in  the presence of delta-aminolaevulinic acid (delta-ala). h. parainfluenzae incubated with increasing amounts of delta-ala showed decreased survival after illumination with 630 nm light. no photodynamic effect on the bacterial viability was found when h. parainfluenzae was grown without added delta-ala. h. influenzae, grown in the presence of delta-ala, but not capable of synthesizing porphyrins from delta-ala, was not affected by pdt. of the range of incident wavelengths, 617 nm appeared to be the most efficient in killing the bacteria. spectrophotometry of the bacterial porphyrins demonstrated that the maximum fluorescence occurred at approximately 617 nm, with a much lower peak around 680  nm. we conclude that a substantial killing of h. parainfluenzae by pdt in vitro after endogenous sensitization with delta-ala can be achieved.

TI  == outer membrane protein d15 is conserved among haemophilus influenzae species and  may represent a universal protective antigen against invasive disease.
AB  == we have cloned and sequenced the d15 gene from two strains of haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) and two strains of nontypeable h. influenzae (nthi). the  nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of d15 are highly conserved, with only a small variable region identified near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. analysis of upstream sequences revealed that the h. influenzae d15 gene may be part of a large potential operon of closely spaced open reading frames, including one with significant homology to the escherichia coli cds gene encoding cdp-diglyceride synthetase. southern blot analysis demonstrated that the d15 gene is also present in h. influenzae types a, c, d, e, and f and in haemophilus parainfluenzae. a recombinant d15 (rd15) protein was expressed in good quantity in e. coli from the inducible t7 promoter, and monospecific anti-rd15 antibodies  were raised. immunoblot analysis of h. influenzae serotypes a, b, c, d, e, and f, nthi, and h. parainfluenzae lysates revealed that they all expressed a cross-reactive d15-like protein. purified rd15 was found to be highly immunogenic in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, and passive transfer of anti-rd15 antibodies protected infant rats from challenge with h. influenzae type b or type a in infant rat models of bacteremia. thus, d15 is a highly conserved antigen that is  protective in animal models and it may be a useful component of a universal subunit vaccine against haemophilus infection and disease.

TI  == development of a haemophilus two-dimensional protein database.
AB  == members of the haemophilus genus are responsible for various human infections including respiratory infections and meningitis. the complete nucleotide sequence of the rd strain of haemophilus influenzae has been reported and represents a valuable resource to investigate gene expression within this bacterial group. we  described previously the application of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-d page) to characterise the proteins of haemophilus influenzae (cash et al., electrophoresis 1995, 16, 135-148). we have extended these data with comparative studies of the proteins from other members of the haemophilus genus (specifically h. parainfluenzae, h. haemolyticus and h. parahaemolyticus) to identify homologous proteins and, by extension, the genes encoding them, among these bacteria. the proteins extracted from each of these bacterial isolates were compared by coelectrophoresis to the 2-d protein profile of the reference nontypable strain of h. influenzae (hi-64443) used as the basis for the 2-d protein database. a composite reference 2-d protein profile of hi-64443 was derived from three independent analyses of the soluble bacterial proteins. between 21% and 37% of the hi-64443 proteins from the reference 2-d protein profile comigrated with proteins in the other isolates from the haemophilus genus. this compared with 62% and 64% comigration when hi-64443 was compared with the eagan and rd strains of h. influenzae, respectively. the 2-d protein profile  of the rd strain of h. influenzae was compared to that of hi-64443 by coelectrophoresis; 64% of the proteins detected for the rd strain comigrated with proteins found for hi-64443 when analysed in parallel. the capacity of 2-d page to investigate global interactions of gene expression was applied to the analysis of superoxide dismutase (sod) expression in h. influenzae strain eagan. a "knock-out" mutant in the soda gene which encodes [mn]-sod was characterised with respect to protein synthesis compared to the parental isolate. from these analyses, the primary product of soda was provisionally identified as a protein with a molecular mass of 25500 da and an estimated pi of 6.55. quantitative changes in the expression of two other proteins in the sod mutant were detected by comparison with the parental isolate. these data are discussed in relation to  the development of a 2-d protein database for h. influenzae and related bacteria  to investigate genome homologies and gene expression.

AB  == iga nephropathy is characterized by iga deposits, predominantly in the glomerular mesangium and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. concerning its pathogenesis, several investigators suggest that the deposited iga is an antibody to viral, bacterial, or dietary antigens. such reports strengthen the possibility of a relationship between mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis of iga nephropathy. we previously observed that haemophilus parainfluenzae (hp) is more  commonly isolated from the pharynx of patients with iga nephropathy than from those with other diseases. we have also identified the glomerular deposition of the outer membranes of hp antigens (omhp) and an increased serum concentration of iga antibodies against omhp in patients with iga nephropathy. these findings suggest that hp has a role in the etiology of iga nephropathy.

TI  == [epidemiology of acute bronchopulmonary infections in children].
AB  == in infants and young children acute lower respiratory infection is the most common cause of morbidity and death especially in developing countries. factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens include  young age, season, sex, indoor pollution, large family size, malnutrition, low immunocompetence, socioeconomic disadvantage. the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in childhood seems similar worldwide. in all countries, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzae virus 1 and 3 influenzae a and b viruses and adenovirus are reported to be the main causes of acute respiratory infections. six microorganisms are responsible of 90% of documented acute bacterial pulmonary infections, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae,  chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus. mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently (30%). the  role of respiratory viruses in predisposing to colonization and invasion of bacterial organisms has often been suggested. in recent years acquired resistance against antibiotic for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae has emerged.

TI  == role of iga, igg, and igm antibodies against haemophilus parainfluenzae antigens  in iga nephropathy.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated glomerular deposition of outer membranes of haemophilus parainfluenzae (hp) antigens (omhp) and the presence of iga antibody  against omhp in patients with iga nephropathy (iga-n). in this study, we analyzed iga-, igg-, and igm-classes of antibodies against omhp, and the relationship between these antibodies and renal lesions in iga-n. the subjects included 44 patients with iga-n and 62 patients with outer glomerular diseases (ogd); the latter group consisted of 23 patients with predominantly igg or igm deposits and  small amounts of iga in the mesangium (group a), and 39 with igg or igm deposits  without iga (group b). iga, igg, and igm antibodies against omhp in patients sera were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). immunoblotting demonstrated that the iga, igg, and igm antibodies against omhp in the sera of iga-n patients bound to components of omhp with molecular weights of 19.5, 30, and 40.5 kd. the amino acid compositions of these three omhp components were similar to those reported for the outer membrane protein (omp) p6 precursor, omp  p5, and omp p2 (porin) of haemophilus influenzae. both iga-n and group a patients, (i.e. those with iga-related renal disease), demonstrated a significantly higher level of iga antibodies against omhp than did group b patients. however, only iga-n patients revealed a significant correlation between the iga-antibody titer and degree of glomerular changes. iga-n patients with macroscopic hematuria or arterio(lo)sclerosis had a significantly higher iga antibody titer than other iga-n patients. there was no relationship between renal lesions and igg or igm antibody titers in any group. these findings suggest that  iga antibodies against omhp are significantly increased in patients with iga-related renal disease compared to those without mesangial iga deposits and that a significant relationship between these antibodies and renal lesions exists only in patients with iga-n.

AB  == fifty-two ovine strains of pasteurella haemolytica and p. trehalosi representing  serotypes 1-16 were examined for the presence of [copper, zinc]superoxide dismutase dna sequences. this was done using a combination of polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers based on the sequence of the [cu,zn]superoxide dismutase gene (sodc) in related species and southern hybridization using a fragment of sodc from p. haemolytica a2 serotype as a probe. both detection methods identified a fragment of the sodc gene in 9/9 strains of p. haemolytica serotype 2 examined and in 5/8 strains of serotype 7. no evidence of this gene was found in any other serotype of p. haemolytica or in any p. trehalosi serotype. comparison of dna sequence showed near identity between sodc from the a2 and a7 serotypes of p. haemolytica and substantial similarity (70%) to sodc previously sequenced in p. multocida, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae. analysis by gel electrophoresis of the superoxide dismutase activity  present in cell lysates showed that one or more superoxide dismutase is present in all serotypes. however, cyanide-inhibitable activity, corresponding to [cu,zn]superoxide dismutase, was detected only in those strains of serotypes a2 and a7 which showed evidence of the sodc gene fragment.

TI  == a multicentre collaborative study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired, lower respiratory tract pathogens 1992-1993: the alexander project.
AB  == the alexander project is a unique, international, collaborative antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. fifteen centres, ten in the european union (eu) and five in the usa, each submitted up to 400 isolated per year for 2 years (1992 and 1993) to a central laboratory for re-identification and determination of mics of 15 antimicrobials using the sensititre microbroth incorporation technique. of the total of 6385 isolates collected, haemophilus influenzae (2718), streptococcus pneumoniae (1856) and moraxella catarrhalis (818) were the most frequently identified pathogens. staphylococcus aureus (690). haemophilus parainfluenzae (183) and klebsiella pneumoniae (120) were identified  less commonly. high-level penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae (mic > or = 2 mg/l) was found in 222 isolates, an overall prevalence of 12% which varied from < 1% in germany, italy, uk and two of the five usa centres, to 3.8-40.4% in the remainder, with the highest prevalence found in france and spain. intermediate penicillin resistance (mic 0.12-1 mg/l) was identified in 228 isolates of s. pneumoniae, an overall prevalence of 12.3%, with individual centre prevalence varying widely (eu, 0-52.3%; usa, 0-20.9%) and not always following that of high-level resistance. resistance to other, unrelated, antimicrobials, except notably the fluoroquinolones, was strongly associated with beta-lactam resistance. beta-lactamase production was detected in 492 isolates of h. influenzae, an overall prevalence of 18.1%. rates of detection varied widely between centres from 1.4% in weingarten, germany in 1993 to 38.5% in barcelona, spain in 1992. in general, the prevalence of beta-lactamase production was higher and less variable in usa centres than in those of the eu. beta-lactamase was detected consistently in the majority of isolates of m. catarrhalis with an overall prevalence of 81.7%. virtually no other resistance phenotype was recognised in this species. of the 690 collected, most isolates of s. aureus produced beta-lactamase with rates of detection varying from 52.2%-89.1%. isolates from two centres, genoa, italy in 1992 and paris, france in 1993, were associated with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistance (34.8% and 43.8%, respectively). combined isolates of h. parainfluenzae and k. pneumoniae accounted for only 4.7% of the total collection. although the current data are insufficient to allow analysis of trends in resistance, the study participants have continued  to collect further isolates in 1994 and 1995 which will be reported in the future.

TI  == tetrameric repeat units associated with virulence factor phase variation in haemophilus also occur in neisseria spp. and moraxella catarrhalis.
AB  == the tetrameric repeat units 5'-caat-3' and 5'-gcaa-3' are associated with phase variable expression of lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic genes in haemophilus influenzae. four other tetrameric repeat units have also been reported from h. influenzae strain rd, 5'-caac-3', 5'-gaca-3', 5'-agct-3', and 5'-ttta-3', which are also associated with putative virulence factors. using oligonucleotide probes corresponding to five tandem copies of each of these tetramers, we have screened  three strains of neisseria meningitidis and one each of neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, haemophilus parainfluenzae, bordetella pertussis, bordetella parapertussis, bordetella bronchiceptica and moraxella catarrhalis for the presence of these motifs. we have demonstrated the presence of multiple copies of the 5'-gcaa-3' motif in all the neisseria strains tested, and also the repeated motif 5'-caac-3' in m. catarrhalis. we have further demonstrated by southern blot analysis that the 5'-caac-3' repeats detected in m. catarrhalis are probably associated with the same genes as in h. influenzae, but that the 5'-gcaa-3' motifs in n. meningitidis are not. the use of characterised tetrameric dna sequences as hybridisation probes may prove useful in the identification of novel phase variable virulence determinants in organisms other than h. influenzae.

AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-containing antigens in bacteria from the mouth and respiratory  tract.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (pc)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. only 41 (15%) isolates were pc-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of haemophilus influenzae. other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of micrococcus spp., and a  single strain each of bacillus sp., corynebacterium jeikeium, lactococcus sp. and h. parainfluenzae. the presence of pc-containing antigens in h. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the c-polysaccharide antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.

TI  == effectiveness of short-course therapy (5 days) with cefuroxime axetil in treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis.
AB  == five hundred thirty-seven patients were enrolled in two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and the safety of 5- or 10-day treatment with cefuroxime axetil with those of 10-day treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis. patients received either 5 or 10 days of treatment (n = 177 in  each group) with cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg twice daily or 10 days of treatment  (n = 183) with amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily. patients in the cefuroxime axetil (5 days) group received placebo on days 6 to 10. bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained preceding and, when possible, following treatment. organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 242 of 537 (45%) patients, with the primary  pathogens being haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus (28, 25, 13, 9,  and 8% of isolates, respectively). pathogens were eradicated or presumed to be eradicated in 87% (52 of 60), 91% (53 of 58), and 86% (60 of 70) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (5 days), cefuroxime axetil (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 82% (107 of 130), 86% (117 of 136), and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (5 days), cefuroxime axetil (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil for either 5 or 10 days (p = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse  events (37 versus 19 and 15%, respectively; p < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. these results indicate that treatment with cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg twice daily for 5 days is as effective as treatment for 10 days with either the same dose of cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily in patients with acute bronchitis. in addition, treatment with cefuroxime axetil for either 5 or 10 days is associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea, than is 10-day treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate.

TI  == comparison of wilkins-chalgren medium supplemented with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and haemophilus test medium for susceptibility testing of clinical haemophilus isolates.
AB  == haemophilus test medium (htm) was compared with wilkins-chalgren agar (wca; supplemented with 15 micrograms/ml nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad)) for antibiotic susceptibility testing of 74 clinical isolates of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion method and the agar dilution procedure were the two tests employed. wca + nad and htm yielded comparable results for the following antimicrobial drugs and drug combinations: ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, ampicillin plus sulbactam, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline. however, wca + nad slightly antagonized rifampin. co-trimoxazole was significantly antagonized by wca + nad. wca + nad was much simpler with regard to in-house preparation, and wca plates could be supplemented with nad following pouring, solidification and storage of the plates simply by surface spreading the required amount of nad with a glass spatula, thus adding considerably to laboratory flexibility. it is suggested that additional laboratories comparatively and critically examine wca + nad medium for antibiotic susceptibility testing of clinical haemophilus isolates.

TI  == clinical comparison of cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis.
AB  == two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials compared the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of two oral antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate, in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis (hereafter denoted acute bronchitis). three hundred sixty patients with signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis were enrolled at 22 centers and were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of treatment with either cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily (bid) (n= 177) or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg three times daily (tid) (n = 183). patients were assessed for both clinical and bacteriologic responses once during treatment (at 3 to 5 days) and twice after treatment (at 1 to 3 days and at 13 to 15 days). bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained before treatment and, when possible, after treatment. organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 162 (45%) of 360 patients, with the primary pathogens being haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus (28%, 25%, 11%, 9%, and 8% of isolates, respectively). thirty-four percent of the h influenzae isolates and 94% of the m catarrhalis isolates that were tested for beta-lactamase production were positive. a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 86% (117 of 136) and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (p = 0.45). with respect to the eradication of bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure,  presumed care, or cure with colonization) was obtained in 91% (53 of 58) and 86%  (60 of 70) of bacteriologically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (p = 0.32). treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil (39% vs 23%; p = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37% vs 15%; p < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. four patients in the cefuroxime axetil group and eight patients in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group withdrew from the study because of drug-related adverse events. these results indicate that cefuroxime axetil 250 mg bid is as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg tid in the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis but produces fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea.

TI  == affinity, conservation, and surface exposure of hemopexin-binding proteins in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae can acquire heme from hemopexin for use as a source of both essential porphyrin and iron. in classical ligand-binding studies, we observed time-dependent, saturable, and displaceable binding of human 125i-labelled hemopexin to intact cells of h. influenzae type b (hib) strain 760705 grown in an iron-restricted medium. from these experiments, which demonstrate that hemopexin associates with a single class of binding site, the affinities (kds) and receptor numbers were calculated for heme-hemopexin (kd, 205 nm; 3,200 receptors per cell) and apohemopexin (kd, 392 nm; 4,400 receptors per cell). thus, hib expresses a specific hemopexin receptor which shows some preference for the heme-protein complex. affinity chromatography on hemopexin-sepharose 4b of detergent-solubilized membranes from hib strain 760705  results in the copurification of three proteins with molecular masses of 57, 38,  and 29 kda. trypsinization of whole cells of hib 760705 abolishes hemopexin binding and correlates with the disappearance of the 57-kda hemopexin-binding protein and appearance of a 52-kda species which does not bind either hemopexin in ligand blot assays or a monoclonal antibody (mabt11-30) raised against the 57-kda protein. from immunoblotting assays and nh2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, the 38-kda protein isolated following hemopexin affinity chromatography was identified as the porin protein p2. these data, taken together with the receptor-binding studies which support a single class of hemopexin-binding site,  suggest that p2 and the 29-kda protein function as accessory proteins to the 57-kda hemopexin-binding protein to facilitate the uptake of heme from receptor-bound hemopexin. to determine whether hemopexin binding and the 57-kda protein are conserved in haemophilus strains, whole-cell dot blots and immunoblots of the outer membrane proteins prepared from strains belonging to each of 21 different hib outer membrane protein subtypes, six nontypeable strains, and five haemophilus parainfluenzae strains were probed with either hemopexin or mabt11-30. only the h. parainfluenzae strains which lack the 57-kda  protein do not bind hemopexin. since h. influenzae has also been shown to produce a soluble 100-kda hemopexin-binding protein, cell-free culture supernatants were  also examined for the presence of this protein. apart from hib 760705 and h. parainfluenzae, the 100-kda hemopexin-binding protein was detected in all the other haemophilus strains. the abilities of hib 760705 to both bind and acquire heme from hemopexin without expressing a 100-kda soluble hemopexin-binding protein show that in strain 760705, this 100-kda protein is not essential for the utilization of heme from hemopexin.

TI  == multicenter trial of cefpodoxime proxetil vs. amoxicillin-clavulanate in acute lower respiratory tract infections in childhood. international study group.
AB  == acute lower respiratory tract infections in children are a worldwide public health problem, with an estimated 4 million potentially preventable deaths every  year. until recently, penicillin and related drugs were the treatment of choice for empiric therapy of paediatric lower respiratory tract infections. however, concerns over the emergence of penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis have led physicians to turn increasingly towards alternatives, such as the third generation cephalosporins. the oral extended spectrum cephalosporin cefpodoxime proxetil is highly active against the bacterial pathogens commonly associated with childhood lower respiratory tract infections. in order to evaluate its clinical efficacy in children with acute febrile lower respiratory tract infections, an international, multicenter, comparative, randomized open study was conducted in children ages 3 months to 11.5 years. of 348 cases enrolled, 234 were randomized to cefpodoxime proxetil (8 mg/kg/day twice daily) and 114 to amoxicilin/clavanulate (amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day 3 times a day). the duration of treatment was 10 days. pretreatment diagnosis was pneumonia in 292 patients, bronchiolitis in 19 patients and acute bronchitis in 37 patients. pathogens isolated from 59 cases included h. influenzae (47.5%), s. pneumoniae (23.7%), m. catarrhalis (11.9%) and haemophilus parainfluenzae (6.8%). clinical efficacy was evaluable in 278 children at the end of treatment when 95.2% of patients in the cefpodoxime proxetil group and 96.7% of patients in the amoxicillin/clavanulate group showed a satisfactory clinical response (cured or improved). the improvement was sustained at the follow-up visit, 10 to 20 days after completion of treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == binding of human high-molecular-weight salivary mucins (mg1) to hemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == in human saliva, two different mucin populations can be distinguished, viz., high-molecular-weight mucins (mg1, mol. wt > 1 x 10(6)) and low-molecular-weight  mucins (mg2, mol. wt approximately 125 kd). the carbohydrate moiety of mg1 displays a wide spectrum of oligosaccharide structures, varying in composition, length, branching, and acidity. the biological significance of the heterogeneity  in carbohydrate structures of mucins is unclear. the present investigation focused on the question whether mg1, because of its diverse carbohydrate side-chain population, can bind to a large variety of oral micro-organisms. a replica plate technique, in combination with immunochemical detection with monoclonal antibodies against mg1, was used to screen in vivo human oral microflora for the presence of micro-organisms which could bind the high-molecular-weight salivary mucin mg1. binding to purified mg1 was established for hemophilus (para)influenzae species, whereas other species, including streptococcus and staphylococcus, were negative. mg1 binding to hemophilus parainfluenzae could be abolished by protease treatment of mg1. in contrast, periodate acid treatment, partial deglycosylation, or addition of monosaccharides did not affect mg1 binding to h. parainfluenzae, indicating that mg1 carbohydrate side-chains were not directly involved in the binding. the binding was ph-dependent, showing an increase when the ph was lowered from 8.0 to 4.0. these  data indicate that mg1 can be bound in a selective manner by hemophilus spp. and  suggest that the 'naked' unglycosylated polypeptide moiety of mg1 is involved in  its binding to hemophilus parainfluenzae.

TI  == clarification of the structure of the ampicillin-resistance plasmid rsf0885 from  haemophilus influenzae hr-885 serotype b.
AB  == the nonconjugative ampicillin-resistance plasmid rsf0885 has been reported to be  as small as 2.9 mda and as large as 4.1 mda with at least two restriction enzyme  maps reported. in addition, the source of the original plasmid has been reported  to be haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. characterization of  the source strains and sequencing data of the plasmids revealed that h. influenzae serotype b was the original source strain and that is1-k in the larger plasmid was presumably acquired when the smaller plasmid was maintained in escherichia coli in s. falkow's laboratory during the late 1970s.

TI  == evaluation of api nh, a new 2-hour system for identification of neisseria and haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis in a routine clinical laboratory.
AB  == api nh is a new 2-h system (biomerieux, la balme-les-grottes, france) for the identification of most neisseria and haemophilus spp. of clinical significance and of moraxella catarrhalis and for the detection of penicillinase production. furthermore, this system allows the biotyping of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. three hundred eighteen strains belonging to these species, previously identified by conventional methods, were tested. among the 305 strains belonging to species included in the data base, 225 (73.8%) were identified without additional tests, 79 (25.9%) were correctly identified after extra tests, and 1 strain (0.3%) was misidentified. for 131 (90.3%) of the 145 h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae strains, results of biotyping were in agreement  with results of standard methods. api nh is an accurate and reliable method for the routine identification of these bacteria in a clinical laboratory, for biotyping of haemophilus spp., and for the detection of penicillinase-producing strains. the system is ready to use and time saving; inoculation of the system and reading of results are easy.

TI  == [clinical studies of s-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  == we studied the clinical use of s-1108 granules in the pediatric field. the results are summarized as follows. 1. s-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. as an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in gpt level was observed. 4. no refusal of the drug occurred. 5. from the above  results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.

TI  == a comparison of cefpodoxime proxetil and cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbation of copd in adults.
AB  == in this multicenter, observer-blinded study, 301 patients with signs and symptoms of acute bacterial exacerbation of copd were randomized (2:1) to receive either cefpodoxime proxetil (200 mg, bid) or cefaclor (250 mg, tid) for 10 days. clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed before treatment, during therapy (study days 3 to 5), at the end of therapy (3 to 7 days posttreatment), and at long-term follow-up (4 weeks posttreatment). the most common pretreatment  isolates were haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. significantly (p < 0.001) more bacterial isolates were  susceptible in vitro to cefpodoxime (233 of 256, 91 percent) than to cefaclor (215 of 255, 84 percent). there were no statistically significant differences between the two drug regimens in eradication of the initial pathogen (cefpodoxime, 116 of 128, 91 percent; cefaclor, 59 of 64, 92 percent) or end-of-therapy clinical response (cure + proved; cefpodoxime, 99 of 100, 99 percent; cefaclor, 45 of 49, 92 percent) rates for evaluable patients. both drug  treatments were well-tolerated, with a similar incidence of drug-related adverse  events (cefpodoxime 11 percent, cefaclor 12 percent). cefpodoxime (bid) was as safe and effective as cefaclor (tid) in the treatment of acute exacerbation of copd. the less frequent dosing regimen of cefpodoxime may improve patient compliance compared to those antibiotics that require three or four daily doses.

TI  == growth characteristics of v factor-independent transformants of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is a v factor-dependent species. a plasmid conferring v factor independence in haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus ducreyi was transferred to plasmid-free h. influenzae rd by dna transformation. the growth characteristics of the transformants in a complex and a chemically defined medium were compared, and the ability of several exogenous pyridine nucleotides and precursors to support growth was examined. although the transformants appeared to be v factor independent in a complex medium, in a chemically defined medium they  exhibited both v factor-dependent and nicotinamide-dependent growth. because of the inability of the plasmid-free h. influenzae rd to utilize nicotinamide for growth, it was concluded that the genes conferring this function were plasmid linked. our results indicate that the v factor requirement, as it is presently defined, is not suitable to serve as a definitive taxonomic criterion for species determination in the family pasteurellaceae.

TI  == transferrin-binding ability of invasive and commensal isolates of haemophilus spp.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae type b expresses an inducible siderophore-independent iron-acquisition system that depends on a direct interaction between human transferrin and specific iron-regulated transferrin-binding outer-membrane proteins. to evaluate the importance of this iron-acquisition system amongst haemophili, 156 isolates of haemophilus spp. (78 commensal isolates and 78 isolates from invasive infections) were examined for their ability to bind transferrin. of the 78 invasive isolates, all of which were h. influenzae type b, 71 (91%) were capable of binding transferrin, with 57 (73%) binding transferrin constitutively (i.e., even when grown in an iron-sufficient medium). in contrast, only 11 (14%) of the commensal isolates bound transferrin constitutively, with a  further 16 (21%) binding transferrin only after growth in an iron-deficient medium. of the 27 commensal strains that were capable of binding transferrin, 12  were h. parainfluenzae biotype iii, 14 were non-typable h. influenzae, and one was h. parahaemolyticus. none of the h. influenzae type b invasive or commensal isolates showed evidence of siderophore production, but 50 (66%) of the remaining 76 commensal isolates appeared to produce an iron chelator. thus, while not a universal characteristic, detectable transferrin-binding was associated strongly  with h. influenzae type b isolates from invasive infections, and was also recognised for the first time in isolates of h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus.

AB  == nine patients with lower respiratory tract infections were used to study in detail the effect of ampicillin or erythromycin on the colonization patterns of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae in sputum and saliva. h. influenzae was isolated from purulent sputum of eight patients before the start of treatment. ampicillin was more effective than erythromycin at clearing h. influenzae from sputum and in decreasing purulence. by careful characterization of multiple strains, the changes in biotype distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns were shown. five biotypes of h. influenzae were associated with chest infection, with type ii predominating. mixed biotype infections occurred in five patients. most saliva contained multiple biotypes of  h. parainfluenzae. neither antibiotic selected resistant haemophili in saliva or  sputum. after treatment with ampicillin, the mucoid sputum was colonized with ampicillin-susceptible h. parainfluenzae biotypes previously found in saliva. we  postulate that as inflammation decreases at the bronchial mucosa, the ampicillin  concentration drops, allowing ampicillin-susceptible oral h. parainfluenzae isolates to seed the residual mucoid sputum.

TI  == identification of highly conserved and species-specific polypeptides of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == chancroid is a sexually transmitted diseased caused by haemophilus ducreyi. the pathological manifestations of chancroid are unique among haemophilus species and the virulence factors of h. ducreyi that account for these features have not been identified. some of these virulence factors may be unique components of h. ducreyi, but attempts to identify h. ducreyi-specific components have been unsuccessful. four polypeptides--a, b, c and d of 83, 77, 56 and 28 kda, respectively--were identified with a panel of nine h. ducreyi-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). polypeptide c was one of the five major proteins in h. ducreyi and demonstrated micro-heterogeneity in sds-page. polypeptides a, b and d were present in only small amounts in whole-cell lysates of h. ducreyi. the relative amounts of a and b varied, suggesting that they may be precursor molecules. the unique polypeptides c and d were not exposed on the surface. polypeptide c was highly soluble and did not appear to be membrane-bound, whereas polypeptide d appeared to partition with the cytoplasmic membrane and was soluble in sarkosyl.  all four polypeptides appeared to be unique to h. ducreyi since mabs directed against them did not cross-react with h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae or neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mol. wts of all of these polypeptides were conserved throughout 35 clinical isolates collected from 15 cities in eight countries and one reference strain of h. ducreyi that were tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == use of an adsorption enzyme immunoassay to evaluate the haemophilus ducreyi specific and cross-reactive humoral immune response of humans.
AB  == serodiagnosis of chancroid is limited by the cross-reactivity of haemophilus ducreyi with haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. this research describes an adsorption enzyme immunoassay (eia) that assesses the humoral immune response of north americans and africans to h. ducreyi. adsorption effectively removed anti-h. influenzae and anti-h. parainfluenzae antibodies, revealing that  north american control sera had no residual anti-h. ducreyi reactivity. however,  african control sera still had a residual anti-h. ducreyi response. assessment of the duration of the humoral immune response in sera from african patients with chancroid showed that the humoral antibodies persisted for up to 8 months after the diagnosis. this may explain the lack of specificity of the adsorption eia in  areas where chancroid is endemic. the detection of the humoral immune response was affected by the strain of h. ducreyi used, with indigent strains being most useful. using h. ducreyi 35000 for canadian sera, the sensitivity of the adsorption eia was 100% and the specificity was 88%. for african sera, h. ducreyi strain r018 was used, and the adsorption eia had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of only 23%. these data reveal that the existing humoral response in  a country where chancroid is endemic differs from that in a country where it is not, and that care must be used interpreting unadsorbed humoral immune responses. the adsorption eia approach may prove useful as an epidemiologic tool for definition of existing (past and present) levels of exposure to h. ducreyi.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties  and clinical efficacy.
AB  == azithromycin is an acid stable orally administered macrolide antimicrobial drug,  structurally related to erythromycin, with a similar spectrum of antimicrobial activity. azithromycin is marginally less active than erythromycin in vitro against gram-positive organisms, although this is of doubtful clinical significance as susceptibility concentrations fall within the range of achievable tissue azithromycin concentrations. in contrast, azithromycin appears to be more  active than erythromycin against many gram-negative pathogens and several other pathogens, notably haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, urea-plasma urealyticum and borrelia burgdorferi. like erythromycin and other macrolides, the activity of azithromycin is unaffected by the production of beta-lactamase. however, erythromycin-resistant organisms are also resistant to azithromycin. following oral administration, serum concentrations of azithromycin are lower than those of erythromycin, but this reflects the rapid and extensive movement of the drug from the circulation into intracellular compartments resulting in tissue concentrations exceeding those commonly seen with erythromycin. azithromycin is subsequently slowly released, reflecting its long terminal phase elimination half-life relative to that of erythromycin. these factors allow for a single dose or single daily dose regimen in most infections, with the potential for increased compliance among outpatients where a more frequent antimicrobial regimen might traditionally be indicated. the potential disadvantage of low azithromycin serum  concentrations, however, is that breakthrough bacteraemia may occur in patients who are severely ill; nevertheless, animal studies suggest that tissue concentrations of azithromycin are more important than those in serum when treating respiratory and other infections. the clinical efficacy of azithromycin  has been confirmed in the treatment of infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts (the latter including paediatric patients), skin and soft tissues (again including paediatric patients), in uncomplicated urethritis/cervicitis associated with n. gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis or u. urealyticum and in the treatment of early lyme disease. azithromycin was as effective as erythromycin and other commonly used drugs including clarithromycin, beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins), and quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics in some of the above infections. some patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to h. influenzae may be refractory to therapy with azithromycin (as is the case with erythromycin) indicating the need  for physician vigilance, although it should be noted that azithromycin is of equivalent efficacy to amoxicillin in the treatment of such patients. in the therapy of urethritis/cervicitis associated with c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoea or u. urealyticum, a single dose azithromycin regimen offers a distinct advantage over currently available pharmacological options, while providing effective therapy.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == nine haemophilus species strains, all beta-lactamase negative, isolated from patients with endocarditis were tested in killing curve experiments. antibiotics  used were penicillin, amoxicillin, aztreonam alone and in combination with tobramycin, as well as ciprofloxacin alone. synergism between beta-lactams and tobramycin with reduction of colony counts to zero was seen after 24 h for h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. segnis strains. ciprofloxacin was as effective as beta-lactam-tobramycin combinations. the h. aphrophilus strain was not killed as effectively as other strains by any of the antibiotics.

TI  == laboratory and clinical evaluations of media for the primary isolation of haemophilus species.
AB  == there has not previously been an objective comparison of medium formulations for  the primary isolation of haemophilus species. this study was undertaken to evaluate the components required for the optimal growth of large, easily identifiable colonies of these bacteria. we compared six medium bases and seven supplements for their ability to support the growth of 86 strains of haemophilus  influenzae and 17 strains of other species of haemophilus. by using a growth index that combines colony size and the dilution factor, a formulation of gc agar base with 1% yeast autolysate and 5% sheep blood (chocolated) promoted the growth of large, easily recognizable colonies of h. influenzae and other haemophilus species. this medium was designated gcysb. the addition of hematin to supplements that supplied nad (or factor v) to the medium was inhibitory to the growth of all of the haemophilus species tested. in a clinical comparison of gcysb with routinely used chocolate agar medium in two laboratories for the primary isolation of haemophilus species, overall gcysb promoted better growth of 124 strains of h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae. gcysb is easy to prepare and inexpensive compared with the ease of preparation and expense of other haemophilus isolation media.

TI  == microbiological considerations of the etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == one hundred eight-four sputum specimens from the same number of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship between the microorganisms isolated and the presumptive pathology. the sputa were subdivided into three groups; "high probability", "low  probability", and "contaminated sputa", following the criteria of the microscopic readings: sputum with more than 25 white cells and low numbers of squamous epithelial cells represents true lower respiratory tract infections (high probability); those with fewer than 25 white cells represent non-bacterial infections or non-infected sputa (low probability) while sputa with more than 25  squamous cells per field represent contaminated specimens (contaminated sputa). statistical analysis was carried out to correlate these data. haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes showed significant differences in the three groups considered.

TI  == double-blind randomized study comparing the efficacies and safeties of a short (3-day) course of azithromycin and a 5-day course of amoxicillin in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == the efficacies and safeties of a three-dose regimen of azithromycin (500 mg once  daily for 3 days) and a 15-dose regimen of amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily  for 5 days) were compared in a double-blind manner in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. a total of 92% of patients suffered a type 1  exacerbation. treatment success, defined as cure or major improvement, was achieved in all patients in the azithromycin group by day 5, compared with 23 (92%) of 25 patients in the amoxicillin group. on day 12, these data were 24 of 25 (96%) in the azithromycin group and 20 of 25 (80%) in the amoxicillin group (results were not significantly different). several pathogens were isolated (mic  ranges [micrograms per milliliter] in parentheses): haemophilus influenzae or haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated 23 times (azithromycin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 32; amoxicillin, 0.12 to 2); streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 11 patients (azithromcyin, less than or equal to 0.06 greater than  256; amoxicillin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.25); moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis was isolated from eight patients (azithromycin, less than or equal to 0.06; amoxicillin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 16); and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from eight patients. one patient treated  with azithromycin had legionella pneumophila pneumonia, and another in that group had a significant rise in titer of antibody against influenza a virus. one patient treated with amoxicillin also had a significant rise in titer of antibody against influenza a virus. microbiological response rates were comparable. one patient who received azithromycin developed abnormal liver function. two patients treated with amoxicillin developed abnormal liver functions, one developed exanthema, and one treatment was stopped because of nausea. it is concluded that  a three-dose (3-day) regimen of azithromycin is as effective clinically and microbiologically as a 15-dose (5-day) regimen of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

TI  == [resistance of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae to beta-lactam antibiotics. characterization of the beta-lactamases].
AB  == we have studied the susceptibility to ampicillin and the characteristics of the beta-lactamase activity of the 169 haemophilus spp. strains (128 h. influenzae, 40 h. parainfluenzae and one h. paraphrophilus) isolated during 12 months, years  1988-1989, in the hospital del mar clinical microbiology laboratory. our objective was to know in the strains of our center the frequency of those resistant or slightly susceptible to ampicillin, the role of beta-lactamases in the loss of susceptibility and the type of enzymes involved. susceptibility was studied by diffusion for all the antibiotics tested and also confirmed by dilution for ampicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. beta-lactamase production was identified by nitrocefin hydrolysis. the isoelectric point of the  beta-lactamase and the identification of their types were determined by analytic  isoelectric focusing. the presence of the codifying gene of the tem-1 enzyme was  studied by hybridization with a tem-1 probe. of the h. influenzae strains 35 were ampicillin resistant, one moderately susceptible and of the h. parainfluenzae strains six were resistant and two moderately susceptible; all were susceptible to the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. the ampicillin-resistant strains were beta-lactamase producers. in 40 strains, by isoelectric focusing, the type tem-1 was identified and the hybridization was positive; in one h. parainfluenzae strain a beta-lactamase of pl 5.8 was observed and the hybridization with tem-1 probe was negative. the three strains moderately susceptible to ampicillin did not produce beta-lactamase.

AB  == fifty-seven patients, from whose sputum haemophilus influenzae (49 cases) or haemophilus parainfluenzae (8 cases) was isolated during a 7-month period, were studied. in the majority of cases there were well-defined predisposing factors to respiratory tract colonisation or infection with the isolates, in particular bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive airways disease. colonisation of the airways, bronchopneumonia in patients with underlying lung disease, acute lobar pneumonia, and postoperative chest infections were the commonest clinical diagnoses. primary acute lobar pneumonia with these organisms alone was uncommon. all of the h. influenzae isolates were nontypeable, and there was a wide range of biotypes of both organisms. three h. influenzae isolates produced beta-lactamase, and there was, in general, a low incidence of resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents on disc susceptibility testing.

AB  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutases ([cu,zn]-sods) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes but have rarely been found in prokaryotes. a gene for [cu,zn]-sod (sodc) has recently been cloned from haemophilus influenzae type b and h. parainfluenzae, so other haemophilus and related species were screened for the presence of [cu,zn]-sods by visualization of bands of sod activity in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and  by gene probing. strains of h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, some non-typable h. influenzae, h. haemoglobinophilus (canis) and h. parasuis were all found to have [cu,zn]-sod activity (inhibited by 2 mm-cyanide) in polyacrylamide gels. in a southern blot analysis, dna from h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. haemolyticus and [cu,zn]-sod-containing non-typable h. influenzae--but not the other species--hybridized to a 360 nucleotide dna probe containing the 5'-part of sodc cloned from h. influenzae type b. bacterial [cu,zn]-sods are more prevalent than has previously been recognized.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

AB  == the antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. when a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. parahaemolyticus was used, the  immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human  immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kda. preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. there was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. with a serum pool adsorbed on the haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  pasteurella ureae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for h. ducreyi were identified. an immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kda protein was expressed by all h. ducreyi isolates. in the range from 34 to 30 kda, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. by using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kda and 34 to 30 kda) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.

TI  == [a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

TI  == determination of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae susceptibility to ampicillin and other antibiotics.
AB  == a sample comprising 40 h. influenzae and 74 h. parainfluenzae strains was used to verify methods for determining susceptibility to antibiotics. modified levinthal  agar proved to be suitable for the agar dilution and agar diffusion method, while brain heart infusion with the thermally released components of sheep blood (x and v factor) and lysed horse blood performed well in the dilution micromethod. the iodometric method served well for beta-lactamase production. a substantial proportion of strains was resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, roxitromycin and sulfamethoxazole. ampicillin susceptibility was of crucial importance. resistance was largely due to beta-lactamase production. since there are ampicillin-resistant strains which fail to produce beta-lactamase, it is necessary either to determine the mic value or use a disk with 2 micrograms ampicillin. a disk containing 10 micrograms ampicillin may yield a false positive result.

AB  == cefixime, a new orally absorbed iminomethoxyaminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was tested against some microorganisms involved in upper and lower respiratory tract  infections such as haemophilus (influenzae and parainfluenzae), moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated in the period from november 1990 to april 1991. its activity was compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ofloxacin. cefixime inhibits 90% of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, both beta-lactamase producers (blp) or not (nblp) at concentrations of less than 0.25 mg/l. it inhibits 90% of m. catarrhalis (blp and nblp) at concentrations of less than 1 mg/l. in general, cefixime has a superior in vitro activity with respect to cefaclor and the other cephalosporins as well as erythromycin and amoxicillin (the last one in blp strains). in the evaluation of the antibacterial activity of beta-lactam against haemophilus and m. catarrhalis, the authors observed different indications in the guidelines for ampicillin. cefixime is not destroyed by the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase produced by haemophilus sp. and m. catarrhalis (tem and rob in haemophilus strains and bro in m. catarrhalis). in view of its excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory tract pathogens, cefixime is indicated in the therapy of these infections.

TI  == adherence of haemophilus influenzae to middle ear mucosa injured by killed h. influenzae.
AB  == repetitive acute otitis media is due to recurrent bacterial infection of middle ear superimposed on chronic otitis media with effusion. endotoxin, one of the constituents of haemophilus influenzae, is present in some cases in the middle ear effusion of otitis media with effusion and has been demonstrated experimentally to damage the middle ear mucosa. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of killed h. influenzae on the adherence of h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae to the middle ear epithelial cells. the numbers of adherent organisms per epithelial cell in ears inoculated previously with killed h. influenzae or with normal saline (0.9% nacl) were compared. prior middle ear inoculation of killed h. influenzae enhanced the adherence of h. influenzae to middle ear epithelial cells, but it had little effect on the adherence of h. parainfluenzae. h. influenzae adhered to middle ear epithelial cells in greater numbers than h. parainfluenzae. results demonstrate that a middle ear pathogen adheres to middle ear epithelial cells presumably damaged by killed h. influenzae, whereas a non-pathogen does not. these findings might partly explain  the increased susceptibility of an ear with chronic otitis media with effusion to recurrent infection with h. influenzae.

TI  == changes in the spectrum of organisms causing respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  == over the last decade, the spectrum of organisms causing community-acquired acute  lower respiratory tract infections has changed. streptococcus pneumoniae now causes approximately 30% of outpatient acute pneumonia-less than in former decades-whereas mycoplasma pneumoniae is found in both young and elderly patients. the enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus are now seen more frequently as respiratory tract pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia patients, and they are the major organisms causing pneumonia in residents of homes for the elderly or nursing homes, and in immuno-compromised patients. agents that were previously considered non-pathogenic for the respiratory tract include serotypes of haemophilus influenzae other than type b, h. parainfluenzae  and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis; these organisms affect mainly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. legionella species can cause sporadic as well as epidemic disease of the lower respiratory tract. chlamydia pneumoniae is  a newly recognized pathogen responsible for mild to severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections. in 60-80% of cases, hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by gram-negative bacilli and s. aureus. these organisms colonize the mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract and penetrate into the lower tract by aspiration or intubation.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  == effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abe)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. the pathologic and  physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with  abe, although these symptoms are not unique to abe. while culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. bacteria in numbers significantly  above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. bacterial species observed with abe include haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of klebsiella and pseudomonas species. one or more elements of background therapy for abe should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for abe. quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.

TI  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutase of haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae.
AB  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutase ([cu,zn]-sod) is widely found in eukaryotes but  has only rarely been identified in bacteria. here we describe sodc, encoding [cu,zn]-sod in haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, frequent colonists and pathogens of the human respiratory tract. in capsulate h. influenzae, sodc was found in only one division of the bacterial population, and although the protein it encoded was clearly [cu,zn]-sod from its deduced sequence, it lacked enzymatic activity. in h. parainfluenzae, in contrast, active enzyme was synthesized which appeared to be secreted beyond the cytoplasm when the gene was  expressed in escherichia coli minicells. the origin of gene transcription differed between the haemophilus species, but protein synthesis from cloned genes in vitro was comparable. a c-t transition was found in the h. influenzae sequence compared with the h. parainfluenzae sequence, leading to a histidine, known to be crucial in eukaryotic [cu,zn]-sod for copper ion coordination and so for enzymatic activity, to be changed to tyrosine. this is speculated to be the cause of inactivity of the h. influenzae enzyme. secreted sods have only been described in a few bacterial species, and this is the first identification of [cu,zn]-sod in a common human upper respiratory tract colonist. the role of secreted bacterial sods is unknown, and we speculate that in haemophilus species the enzyme may confer survival advantage by accelerating dismutation of superoxide of environmental origin to hydrogen peroxide, disruptive to the normal mucociliary clearance process in the host.

TI  == reduction in the incidence of acute bronchitis by an oral haemophilus influenzae  vaccine in patients with chronic bronchitis in the highlands of papua new guinea.
AB  == following the administration of a standardized questionnaire, 62 adult patients with chronic bronchitis were enrolled into a double-blind controlled trial of an  oral killed haemophilus influenzae vaccine in the highlands of papua new guinea.  a 3-day course of vaccine or placebo was given monthly for 3 consecutive months.  participants were monitored weekly over 12 months for acute exacerbations; early  morning sputum specimens were collected monthly and during acute exacerbations. density of colonization by h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae was determined by  standard quantitative and semiquantitative techniques, and the latter method (quadrant score) was used to determine the density of growth of pneumococci. a total of 30 patients received vaccine and 32 placebo. the incidence rate of acute bronchitis in the vaccine group (0.011 episodes/person-weeks) was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (0.021 episodes/person-weeks), but there was no difference between the two groups in the incidence rates of more severe disease. vaccine efficacy was maximal at times of peak incidence of disease. there was no evidence of a decline in vaccine efficacy for acute bronchitis over  the 12-month follow-up period. the number of viable h. influenzae in the sputum declined in both vaccine and placebo groups over the 12-month follow-up period. the average concentration of h. influenzae in the vaccine group fell below that in the placebo group within 1 to 2 months after first immunization and remained so for 12 months, although the difference between the two groups narrowed during  the follow-up period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [etiology of lower respiratory infections in hospitalized infants].
AB  == as a contribution to knowledge about the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (lri) in infants, 235 patients aged one year or less admitted to a children's hospital at northern metropolitan area of santiago, chile along years  1987 throughout 1989 with radiologically confirmed diagnosis were studied. infants were eligible only if their symptoms lasted for not more than five days and their hospital stay was less than two days. controls consisted on 74 healthy  infants. a search for presumptive etiology was done by means of usual bacteriological procedures (pharyngeal swabs and blood cultures), plus latex test for type b haemophilus influenzae (hib) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) in concentrated urine specimens; indirect immunofluorescence (if) for specific chlamydia trachomatis (ct) igm; serological tests, isolation and if in pharyngeal aspirates for syncytial respiratory virus (srv), influenza, parainfluenzae and adenoviruses were also used. evidence of viral infection was detected from 135/235 (57.5%) of cases and 21/74 (28.3%) controls, srv being the most common. from 18/119 and 2/119 studied patients hib and sp antigens were respectively detected, but urinary antigens were also present in 6/24 controls, raising questions about this test's specificity. if titers of 1:32 or higher for ct were  found in 5/80 patients, all younger than 5 months. it was possible to perform the whole set of available methods in 80 patients, in 70% of which some evidence of a known etiologic agent was found. serology alone gave etiological clues in only 30% of these cases and usual microbiological cultures of throat swabs and blood from none of them. no combinations of age, fever, respiratory rate, apnea, bronchial obstructive syndrome, white blood cell counts over 15,000 or of band forms over 500 per cu mm, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, reactive c protein and x-ray findings allowed differential diagnosis between presumptive bacterial or viral etiology, except in one case of an infant presenting with pleural effusion  and positive antigenuria for hib.

TI  == distribution of protein d, an immunoglobulin d-binding protein, in haemophilus strains.
AB  == protein d, a novel surface protein of the bacterial species haemophilus influenzae with specific affinity for human immunoglobulin (ig) d was detected in all 127 h. influenzae strains studied. all strains representing different serotypes of encapsulated strains and different biotypes of nonencapsulated strains bound 125i-labeled igd to a high degree (38 to 74%). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that protein d from all h. influenzae strains had the same apparent molecular weight (i.e., 42,000) and reacted with all three different anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies. by scatchard analysis, the number of protein d residues  on a nontypeable h. influenzae strain was estimated to be approximately 2,800 per organism. the equilibrium constant for the reaction between a human igd myeloma protein and igd was found to be 5.8 x 10(8) m-1. also, all strains of h. haemolyticus and h. aegypticus strains tested bound igd, 21 to 28% and 41 to 48%, respectively. in extracts of those bacteria, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein reactive with igd and all three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies was found. in h. parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein that was reactive with one to three of three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies but not reactive with  human igd was detected with western blot analysis. other haemophilus species (h.  ducreyi, h. parasuis, h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. haemoglobinophilus)  did not react with human monoclonal igd or anti-protein d antibodies. on the basis of the wide distribution of protein d among h. influenzae strains, we suggest that protein d could be a vaccine candidate.

TI  == comparative study of clarithromycin and roxithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the efficacy and tolerance of clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily) were compared with those of roxithromycin (150 mg twice daily) in an open, multicentre trial of 77 inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. sixty-five patients were clinically evaluable (34, clarithromycin; 31 roxithromycin). efficacy was comparable between treatment groups: 26 of 34 patients (76%) treated with clarithromycin were clinically cured, including four with atypical pneumonia. in  the roxithromycin group 25 of 31 patients (81%) were clinically cured and one was improved. cough, appearance of sputum, and fever improved in most patients in both treatment groups. chest x-rays after treatment showed resolution or improvement in 76% of patients who received clarithromycin and 87% of those who received roxithromycin. the clinical evaluation of the response generally agreed  with the bacteriological response. among patients who were bacteriologically evaluable for four target organisms (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis) the pathogen was eradicated in four of seven (57%) in the clarithromycin-treated group and in five of six (83%) in the roxithromycin-treated group. adverse events were reported in  more patients who received roxithromycin (21.6%) than in those who received clarithromycin (12.5%) although the incidences were not statistically significantly different. the majority of adverse events were transient increases  in serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. clarithromycin was shown to be effective and well-tolerated; the clinical efficacy and safety of clarithromycin and roxithromycin were comparable.

TI  == detection of haemophilus influenzae in cerebrospinal fluids by polymerase chain reaction dna amplification.
AB  == two primer sets were chosen for the detection of haemophilus influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna amplification. one primer set was selected from sequences encoding a capsulation-associated protein  and reacted with target dna from all 15 capsulate h. influenzae strains (all serotypes) examined. the other primer set was selected from the dna sequence of a gene encoding for outer-membrane protein p6 and reacted with the 15 capsulate and 10 non-capsulate strains of h. influenzae tested. this primer set also reacted with the closely related species h. haemolyticus and h. aegyptius, and with two of nine h. parainfluenzae strains. in reconstruction experiments, pcr dna amplification was able to detect as few as five h. influenzae cells when 40 cycles of amplification were used. two hundred cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples  collected consecutively from patients suffering from meningitis were investigated by pcr; 40 were culture-positive for h. influenzae and 39 of these were also clearly positive in the pcr test with both primer sets. contamination occurred to some extent with 40 cycles of amplification but was completely eliminated when the number of cycles was reduced to 35. we conclude that the two primer sets are  appropriate for the detection of h. influenzae by pcr, each having its own specificity. when these two primer sets are used, pcr is a technique of equivalent sensitivity to culture for the detection of h. influenzae in csf.

TI  == siderophore-independent acquisition of transferrin-bound iron by haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  == the specificity by which haemophilus species acquired iron from transferrin (tf)  was investigated. in a plate bioassay h. influenzae used iron bound to human, bovine and rabbit tfs but not mouse, rat, dog, horse, guinea-pig, pig or ovo- tfs or human and bovine lactoferrins. in contrast, h. pleuropneumoniae used iron only from pig tf whilst h. parainfluenzae was unable to utilize iron bound to any of the human or animal tfs tested. the inhibition of growth imposed on h. influenzae type b strain eagan by the addition of the synthetic iron chelator edda to the culture medium was reversed by 30% iron-saturated human tf added directly to the  medium but not when the tf was contained inside a dialysis bag. dot-blotting of whole cells revealed that human tf bound to the surface of bacteria cultured in iron-restricted but not in iron-plentiful media. incubation of whole bacterial cells in the presence of the proteolytic enzyme trypsin also abolished tf-binding activity, suggesting that the tf receptor was a protein. in competition dot blotting experiments, human and bovine but not rabbit, dog, mouse or guinea-pig tfs blocked the binding of a horseradish peroxidase--human tf conjugate. sds-page and western blotting of outer membranes revealed the presence of a tf-binding protein of approximately 72 kda. these results suggest that the acquisition of tf-bound iron by h. influenzae type b probably involves a direct interaction with an outer-membrane protein which shows some tf-species specificity.

AB  == a comparative study of sultamicillin (an orally active dimer of sulbactam and ampicillin) and amoxycillin for the treatment of acute otitis media was carried out in 86 children with acute otitis media. after 10 days' treatment, of those with traditional middle ear pathogens, 35/36 (97%) 50 mg/kg.day or 500 mg/day sultamicillin-treated children were cured with eight relapses after a further 18  days without treatment compared with 12/13 (92%) 40 mg/kg.day or 250 mg/day amoxycillin-treated children and three subsequent relapses. all six beta-lactamase-producing pathogens were in the sultamicillin treatment group: four were haemophilus influenzae/h. parainfluenzae that were resistant to amoxycillin, and all were cured although two then relapsed. no significant clinical or laboratory side-effects were noted in either amoxycillin- or sultamicillin-treated patients. it is concluded that sultamicillin was comparable to amoxycillin in the treatment of acute otitis media.

TI  == [clinical studies on cefixime in pediatrics].
AB  == clinical usefulness of cefixime (cfix), a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, in pediatric field was investigated. the results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. the clinical efficacy of cfix was investigated in a total of 138 children including 49 with upper respiratory tract infections (rti), 22 with acute bronchitis, 18 with pneumonia, 19 with scarlet fever and 21 with urinary tract infections (uti). 2. clinical effectiveness was excellent in 58, good in 60, fair in 14 and poor in 3, with an overall efficacy rate of 87.4%. the efficacy rate classified according to types of infection were 85.7% in upper rti, 89.5% in acute bronchitis, 94.4% in pneumonia, 78.9% in scarlet fever, and 90.5%  in uti. 3. out of the suspected causative organisms, 43 strains of a total of 50  strains isolated were eradicated. the bacteriological eradication rate was 86.0%. (haemophilus influenzae 100%, haemophilus parainfluenzae 100%, streptococcus pyogenes 88.5%, escherichia coli 85.7%). 4. one hundred forty four children were  analyzed for side effect. side effects were observed in 2 children (1.4%) with diarrhea in 1 and anorexia in another. abnormal laboratory test results were recorded in 4 children (3.3%). the above results suggest that cfix is a very useful new oral cephalosporin for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == introduction of transposon tn916 dna into haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus  parainfluenzae.
AB  == enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis transposon tn916 was introduced into haemophilus influenzae rd and haemophilus parainfluenzae by transformation and demonstrated to transpose efficiently. haemophilus transformants resistant to tetracycline were observed at a frequency of approximately 3 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(3)/micrograms of either pam120 (pgl101::tn916) or pam180 (pam81::tn916) plasmid dnas, which are incapable of autonomous replication in this host. restriction enzyme analysis and southern blot hybridization revealed that (i) tn916 integrates into many different sites in the h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae genomes; (ii) only the 16.4-kilobase-pair tn916 dna integrates, and no vector dna was detected; and (iii) the tetr phenotype was stable in the absence of selective pressure. second-generation tn916 transformants occurred at  the high frequency of chromosomal markers and retained their original chromosomal locations. similar results were obtained with h. influenzae rd bc200 rec-1 as the recipient strain, which suggests host rec functions are not required in tn916 integrative transposition. transposition with tn916 is an important procedure for mutagenesis of haemophilus species.

TI  == comparative evaluation of cefuroxime axetil and cefaclor for treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == cefuroxime axetil, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin, was compared with cefaclor for the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in 106 adult patients. direct sinus aspirations for quantitative bacterial culture were done for all patients before treatment; aspiration was repeated for most patients after treatment. pretreatment sinus aspirates were positive for 63 of 134 sampled sinuses. of specimens yielding at least 10(4) cfu/ml, haemophilus influenzae (38%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (37%) were the most common pathogens. ten (42%) of 24 strains of h influenzae, 2 (40%) of 5 haemophilus parainfluenzae, and all 3 isolates (60%) of branhamella catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase. cefuroxime axetil, 250 mg twice a day, was compared with cefaclor, 500 mg three times a day. among culture-positive sinuses, bacteriologic cure was achieved in 36 (95%) of 38 sinuses and 15 (71%) of 21 sinuses treated with cefuroxime axetil  and cefaclor, respectively. the overall frequencies of adverse events were similar between drugs, although cefuroxime axetil was associated with more frequent diarrhea. cefuroxime axetil was an effective therapy for the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults.

TI  == genetic relatedness of antibiotic resistance determinants in multiply resistant hemophilus influenzae.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance determinants and plasmids present in 10 multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of hemophilus influenzae isolated from patients in different geographic regions of spain were characterized. conjugative plasmids with molecular sizes of 38-50 mda encoded resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. trimethoprim resistance was not linked to the other antibiotic resistance determinants and trimethoprim-resistant transconjugants and transformants lacked  detectable plasmid dna, suggesting that this determinant is chromosomal. restriction endonuclease analysis revealed similarities among the plasmids, but several restriction patterns could be distinguished. three hybridization patterns were found with dna probes coding for h. parainfluenzae beta-lactamase and chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase. resistance to kanamycin was due to drug modification by aminoglycoside-phosphotransferase (3')i. in spain, it appears that multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes in h. influenzae did not arise from acquisition of a single r plasmid; rather, both plasmid and chromosomal resistance evolved independently from several sources.

TI  == utilization of transferrin-bound iron by haemophilus species of human and porcine origins.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae and h. haemolyticus acquired iron bound to human transferrin but not to human lactoferrin, ovo- or porcine transferrins. conversely the swine pathogens h. pleuropneumoniae and h. parasuis used iron bound only to porcine transferrin. growth under conditions of iron deprivation induced the production of siderophores and iron-repressible outer membrane proteins in h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus and h. parasuis but not in h. influenzae, h. haemolyticus or h. pleuropneumoniae. the latter 3 haemophilus species appear to sequester transferrin bound iron via a siderophore-independent  mechanism. however, the ability to produce iron chelating compounds did not enable h. parainfluenzae or h. paraphrophilus to utilize transferrin bound iron.

TI  == distribution of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae biotypes isolated from the human genitourinary tract.
AB  == a total of 3,598 genital specimens from men and women was cultured for haemophilus spp. using a simple selective culture method. two hundred and thirty  three samples (6.5%) were positive for haemophilus spp., 216 haemophilus parainfluenzae and 28 haemophilus influenzae strains being isolated. biotyping demonstrated that haemophilus parainfluenzae biotype ii was dominant at all sites, especially the male urethra, comprising 59% of all haemophilus strains isolated. on the other hand, haemophilus influenzae biotype iv was isolated from  only six patients and thus was not a major genital biotype. the respective proportions of the two haemophilus spp. recovered from various mucosal sites led  to the supposition that the genitourinary colonization originated either from the upper respiratory tract or the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == nonculture detection of haemophilus influenzae in sputum with monoclonal antibodies specific for outer membrane lipoprotein p6.
AB  == isolation of haemophilus influenzae from sputum is hampered by overgrowth by other microorganisms or by antibiotic treatment of the patient. to overcome this  problem in the detection of h. influenzae, an in situ immunoperoxidase staining technique was developed with monoclonal antibody (mab) 8bd9, immunoglobulin subclass g2a. mab 8bd9 appeared to be directed to an epitope on the outer membrane lipoprotein p6 of h. influenzae. the species specificity of mab 8bd9 was analyzed by staining isolates from different bacterial species. mab 8bd9 reacted  with all 300 h. influenzae strains tested and with h. aegyptius and h. haemolyticus. twenty-six of 30 h. parainfluenzae strains, other haemophilus species, and other bacterial species often isolated from sputum were not stained. the staining technique was compared with culture of 845 routinely obtained sputum samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. in 829 sputa (98.1%), the results of both techniques were in agreement; 173 were positive for h. influenzae, and 656 were negative. with 14 sputum samples, the staining method gave a positive result for h. influenzae, but the bacterium was not cultured. this could be ascribed to antibiotic treatment of the patient (n = 7), the presence of other mab 8bd9-positive haemophilus species in the sputum (n = 5), and overgrowth by swarming proteus mirabilis or by branhamella catarrhalis. in the immunoperoxidase- and gram-stained smears of two sputum samples, no bacteria  were seen, although some h. influenzae was cultured. on the basis of these results, we conclude that immunoperoxidase staining with mab 8bd9 is a fast and reliable extension of the available detection techniques for h. influenzae.

TI  == clonal analysis of hemophilus influenzae isolated from children from pakistan with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the clonal diversity of 105 hemophilus isolates from the blood of children with lower respiratory tract infection in pakistan was analyzed. ten isolates were identified as h. parainfluenzae and 95 as h. influenzae. of the h. influenzae isolates, 61 (64%) were serotype b and 34 (36%) were nontypable; 95% of the type  b isolates were members of a single clonal group (as defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, sds-page outer membrane protein profile, and biotype). this clone is rarely observed among type b strains recovered from patients with invasive type b disease in the usa or europe. the nontypable isolates in islamabad also were clonally restricted: 9 clonal groups were found among 34 isolates, with just 5 clonal groups accounting for most (82%) of the strains. children infected with type b strains were hospitalized more often than those with nontypable h. influenzae disease (64% vs. 41%, p = .06), but no other clinical or demographic features distinguished children infected by type b and nontypable strains.

TI  == typing of urogenital, maternal, and neonatal isolates of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae in correlation with clinical source of isolation and evidence for a genital specificity of h. influenzae biotype iv.
AB  == over a period of 6 years, 114 strains of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae were isolated from genital, mother-infant, or neonatal infections. their serotypes, biotypes, antibiotic resistance phenotypes, and outer membrane protein (omp) electrophoretic patterns were characterized and correlated with the various clinical outcomes. genital h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae appeared to behave mostly as opportunistic pathogens; for instance, 62% of the cases of endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease were related to the presence of an intrauterine device. however, as seen clearly in one case, the strains may be sexually transmitted. the analysis of omp patterns proved to be a very convenient method to seek evidence for the sexual origin of the infection. h. influenzae was more often involved in complicated genital infections than was h. parainfluenzae. nontypeable and biotype ii h. influenzae strains were the more frequent isolates, except in pelvic inflammatory diseases, in which biotype i prevailed, and in mother-infant infections, in which one-fourth of the cases were due to biotype iv. characterization of h. influenzae isolates did not support a general concept  of specific genital strains. however, strains of biotype iv clearly stood out with two characteristics: (i) a peritrichous fimbriation and (ii) a very peculiar homogeneous omp pattern comprising an omp of molecular weight approximately 18,000 unique to this biotype. these characteristics were also found in h. influenzae biotype iv strains isolated from genital infections in the united states and used as controls. h. influenzae biotype iv strains may thus correspond to a group somewhat adapted to the genital tract.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of haemophilus species in hong kong.
AB  == altogether 403 haemophilus spp. were isolated in seven hospital laboratories in hong kong during june 1986, mostly from sputum. of these 73% were haemophilus influenzae and 27% haemophilus parainfluenzae. all the isolates of h. influenzae  were non-capsulated; haemophilus spp. were not isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (csf) during the period of the study. antimicrobial resistance, including multiple resistance, was common. of all the strains of h. influenzae, 20% were resistant to 1 mg/l ampicillin, (all except one by production of tem-1 beta-lactamase), 65% were resistant to 0.5 mg/l erythromycin, 25% to 1 mg/l tetracycline, 14% to 1 mg/l chloramphenicol (mediated by the production of a chloramphenicol-destroying enzyme) and less than 1% to 8 mg/l cefaclor and 0.5 mg/l trimethoprim. all isolates were susceptible to cephamandole and cefuroxime. haemophilus parainfluenzae showed similar susceptibilities, except that a greater proportion of strains was sensitive to erythromycin and chloramphenicol. only 50% of the ampicillin-resistant strains of h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae contained detectable plasmids of 2-55 mdal arranged in six  to nine different plasmid profiles. resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol  has increased markedly in isolates of h. influenzae in hong kong over the last 5  years. this resistance may be associated with transposable genes.

AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies specific for haemophilus ducreyi: a screening method to discriminate specific and cross-reacting antibodies.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is the etiological agent of chancroid. the organism shares extensive immunological cross-reactivity with other haemophilus species. this presents substantial difficulties for the production of specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). a competition elisa was devised for hybridoma screening which  allowed the detection of h. ducreyi-specific antibody-producing hybridoma cultures during the initial screening process. with this screening method, seven  mabs specific for h. ducreyi were obtained in a single cell fusion exercise. the  specificities of the 7 mabs were demonstrated by direct elisa and dot immunobinding assays against several strains each of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. five of the mabs reacted against all ten strains of h. ducreyi. these mabs may permit the development of rapid and efficient immunodiagnostics for chancroid. the principle of the competition elisa for hybridoma screening should be widely applicable to the development of specific mabs to other organisms in which immunological cross-reactivity is an impediment to hybridoma screening by conventional methods.

AB  == to establish a rapid method for detection of haemophilus influenzae, an antiserum against h. influenzae (anti-hibomp) was prepared by immunization of rabbits with  crude outer membrane proteins (omp) of h. influenzae type b. various isolates of  h. influenzae including typable and nontypable strains and other species were tested by elisa and western blot assay with anti-hibomp. the results are as follows: 1. anti-hibomp reacted to all of the omps from 18 h. influenzae isolates which contained typable and nontypable strains by western blot assay. molecular weights of these omps were about 24, 27, 31, 34, 39 and 45 kilo-dalton. this result suggests that all h. influenzae isolates have identical antigenic proteins on their outer membranes. 2. it was found that 172 out of 179 (96%) culture suspensions of h. influenzae isolates including 66 typable and 113 nontypable showed positive result by elisa with anti-hibomp. 3. to define the cross-reactivity of anti-hibomp, 20 species (111 isolates) other than h. influenzae were tested by the elisa. all isolates were negative with exception of a portion of h. parainfluenzae and staphylococcus aureus producing protein a. the cross-reactions to h. parainfluenzae and s. aureus were removed by absorption of  anti-hibomp with formalinized cells of h. parainfluenzae and reduction of the antibody to f(ab)2 with pepsin digestion respectively.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == identification of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the microscan haemophilus-neisseria identification panel.
AB  == the haemophilus-neisseria identification (hnid) panel (american microscan, sacramento, calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of haemophilus and neisseria spp., branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, and gardnerella vaginalis. the hnid panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and hnid identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. in addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the hnid data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. the hnid panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 g. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28  neisseria lactamica strains and 48 b. catarrhalis strains. only 64.7% of 68 neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. among the haemophilus  spp., 98.8% of 83 h. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 h. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. eight strains of neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for b. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae. isolates of other species not included in the data base, including eikenella corrodens, kingella spp., and cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique  biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species,  and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and  utility of the hnid panel.

TI  == characterization of the outer-membrane proteins of haemophilus parainfluenzae expressed under iron-sufficient and iron-restricted conditions.
AB  == sds-page of the outer-membrane (om) proteins of haemophilus parainfluenzae p205 grown under iron-sufficient conditions revealed three major proteins of 40, 37 and 13 kda. in addition, growth under conditions of iron-restriction resulted in  the expression of at least four iron-repressible om proteins (iromps) of 72, 81,  88 and 90 kda. om proteins of 40 and 13 kda were non-covalently associated with peptidoglycan and were resistant to digestion with trypsin. a 38 kda peptidoglycan-associated protein, which was masked by the abundant 37 kda protein, was also observed following tryptic digestion of whole cells or oms. neither the 37 kda protein (which was heat-modifiable) nor the iromps were peptidoglycan-associated, and both were cleaved following treatment of whole cells with trypsin, indicating that they are exposed at the cell surface. a variety of iromps from five other h. parainfluenzae strains was also observed. in each strain, both the iromps and a major protein of 37 kda were exposed at the cell surface.

TI  == dna probe technology for rapid detection of haemophilus influenzae in clinical specimens.
AB  == in a previous study, we reported that a 5-kilobase haemophilus influenzae dna fragment involved in penicillin-binding protein expression could be used as a probe for specific detection of h. influenzae strains (f. malouin and l. e. bryan, mol. cell. probes 1:221-232, 1987). here, we report the ability of this probe to detect h. influenzae in clinical specimens. in a bacterial dot experiment, there was strong hybridization of the 32p-labeled probe to nonencapsulated and serotype a through f h. influenzae strains. the detection of  h. influenzae in body fluids was then evaluated by using pooled human serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sputum as dilution media for h. influenzae, haemophilus aegyptius, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and escherichia coli cells. at 65 degrees c, the probe hybridized to h. influenzae and h. aegyptius (greater than or equal to 10(5) cells) in all fluids. there was no hybridization with the  e. coli negative control, and h. parainfluenzae hybridized when greater than or equal to 10(7) cells were used. experiments performed at 73 and 80 degrees c permitted elimination of h. parainfluenzae hybridization. the detection of h. influenzae in 232 sputa from patients with respiratory tract infections was very  specific (96 to 97%) and sensitive (74 to 100%) when the total time of the procedure was sufficient (6 to 24 h) and when the experiments were performed at 80 degrees c. in addition, the probe detected three of three and four of four h.  influenzae-infected cerebrospinal fluids and blood cultures, respectively, and did not react with pneumococcus- or streptococcus-infected cerebrospinal fluids.  finally, by using a small-scale procedure, the probe rapidly detected h. influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid and sputum specimens (4 and 8 h, respectively). these results imply prompt diagnosis of h. influenzae infections caused by nonencapsulated and serotype a through f strains.

TI  == comparison of two nonculture techniques for detection of hemophilus influenzae in sputum. in situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == two nonculture methods, in situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase staining with  monoclonal antibodies, were compared for the detection of hemophilus influenzae in 184 sputa. for in situ hybridization, a biotin-labeled probe of total genomic  dna of h influenzae type b was prepared that hybridizes specifically with h influenzae, h parainfluenzae, h hemolyticus, and h parahemolyticus dna. immunoperoxidase staining was done with monoclonal antibody 8bd9 directed against outer membrane protein p6 of h influenzae. both techniques detected hemophilus in sputum equally well and were superior to culture: all 30 sputum samples culture-positive for h influenzae were positive on both nonculture tests, and 13  additional positive sputum samples were detected from which hemophilus was not cultured. the higher sensitivity of the nonculture tests was mainly attributed to culture failure because of overgrowth of h influenzae by other bacteria, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis. the immunoperoxidase staining technique appeared slightly easier and quicker to perform than the in situ hybridization test. for the in situ dna hybridization probe, dna can be prepared  from any strain of h influenzae. the immunoperoxidase test requires monoclonal antibody 8bd9 but has a higher specificity than the hybridization technique. both techniques can be reliably applied, especially for the detection of hemophilus in sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis.

TI  == biotyping respiratory haemophilus species with the microbact system.
AB  == the biochemical characteristics of 114 respiratory haemophilus isolates were examined by the minitek and microbact systems. the microbact system was easy to use and read, although some of the less important reactions (glucose and xylose)  were difficult to interpret on occasions. on the basis of the 3 crucial reactions--indole production, ornithine decarboxylase and urease activity--discrepancies between the two systems were minor. given careful standardization of techniques the microbact system is a suitable alternative to established techniques for the biotyping of h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == [microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. it has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. we measured, using the ga-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. also activities (expressed in mics) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. tested organisms included streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (29), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as gram-positive cocci, and haemophilus influenzae (1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), bordetella pertussis (12), salmonella sp. (4) and campylobacter jejuni (103) as gram-negative bacilli. against stock strains of bacteria, mics of 10 drugs (rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), midecamycin acetate (mom), clindamycin (cldm), amoxicillin (ampc), cefaclor (ccl), minocycline, ofloxacin (oflx] were determined. against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with rkm, mics of only 4 drugs (rkm, em, jm, mom) were determined. measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of rkm and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with rkm (dry syrup). two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with rkm at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. clinical and bacteriological  effects of rkm were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis,  3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28  streptococcal infections, 29 campylobacter enteritis, 4 salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. in the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. adverse reactions of rkm and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. the ga-test produced ph values indicating that amounts of gastric acid  were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern netherlands.
AB  == results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. no explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by b. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.

TI  == surveillance study of resistance in haemophilus species in greece.
AB  == the results are presented of the first surveillance study in greece on resistance in strains of haemophilus influenzae (n = 61) and haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 96) to six antibiotics. strains were isolated in a three-month period in 1987 in  most cases from sputum specimens from adult patients with lung infections. the overall rate of resistance to ampicillin was 28.3%, to chloramphenicol 2.7%, to cefaclor 2.7%, to tetracycline 10.6%, to erythromycin 38.1% and to cotrimoxazole  5.3%. it is evident that the resistance rate of haemophilus spp. is steadily increasing in greece as in other european countries. regular surveys of resistance patterns for both older and newer antimicrobial agents are therefore necessary.

TI  == imipenem-cilastatin in the treatment of respiratory infections in patients with chronic airways obstruction.
AB  == chest infections with organisms resistant to conventional antibiotics are common  in patients with chronic lung disease. we have studied the use of imipenem in 40  (28 m 12 f) patients admitted for treatment of chest infections. patients were treated with imipenem 0.5 g four times daily by intravenous infusion for 6.3 +/-  1.6 (s.d.) days. forty-six respiratory pathogens were cultured from 36 patients including 18 haemophilus influenzae, 6 h. parainfluenzae, 6 streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 branhamella catarrhalis. forty-three  of the 46 isolates were sensitive to imipenem, 28 to ampicillin, 33 to tetracycline and 35 to cotrimoxazole. thirty-eight of the 40 patients improved clinically, and 34 of the 36 patients with positive sputum culture had no pathogens in their sputum after treatment. twenty patients developed minor phlebitis at the infusion site but there were few other side effects. imipenem may prove useful in the treatment of chest infections, particularly when the organism is resistant to conventional antibiotics.

TI  == nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. suspensions of veillonella parvula and haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing neisseria subflava or streptococcus sanguis. the maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. this ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. these results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.

TI  == characterisation of histophilus ovis and related organisms by restriction endonuclease analysis.
AB  == the banding profiles generated by bam h1 restriction endonuclease cleavage of bacterial dna from clinical and reference isolates of histophilus ovis, haemophilus somnus and related bacteria were compared. h. ovis, h. somnus and haemophilus agni isolates were found to have distinct similarities in banding profiles characterised by 10 common bands between 2.0 and 9.6 kilobases (kb). the close taxonomic relationship of these isolates was reinforced by these findings.  the reference isolates examined in this study--actinobacillus lignieresii, actinobacillus seminis, h. agni, h. somnus, h. ovis, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus parahaemolyticus--could be distinguished  from each other on the basis of their characteristic banding profiles. actinobacillus sp were observed to have more bands between 2 and 23 kb compared with the h. ovis and haemophilus sp isolates studied. analysis of isolates from an experimental infection trial illustrated the potential of restriction endonuclease analysis in molecular epidemiological applications. it was possible  to demonstrate by this means that the post-challenge isolates had identical banding profiles to the challenge (or infecting) isolate which had a distinctly different banding profile from that of pre-challenge h. ovis isolates. furthermore, restriction endonuclease analysis of h. ovis isolates obtained from  follow-up investigations of a recurrent problem of epididymitis in unmated rams,  indicated that the h. ovis isolates implicated in epididymitis, were present as a single strain in a number of sheep over a period of time. this suggested that the mechanism of transmission was by perinatal perputial contamination.

TI  == sulbactam/ampicillin vs. chloramphenicol/ampicillin for the treatment of meningitis in infants and children.
AB  == eighty-one patients ages one month to 14 years with meningitis were randomized to receive either sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) and ampicillin (400 mg/kg per day; 41 patients) or chloramphenicol and ampicillin (40 patients). the groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated  with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. in the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five streptococcus pneumoniae, five neisseria meningitidis, one klebsiella pneumoniae, one pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one listeria. in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 h. influenzae isolates, 10 s. pneumoniae, three n. meningitidis, one haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one citrobacter. of 63 patients with assessable csf pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (s. pneumoniae)  and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, h. influenzae; three, s. pneumoniae; and one, citrobacter). twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. no clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.

TI  == origin of small beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids in haemophilus species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == fifty-nine percent of unselected strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae were found to carry small, phenotypically cryptic plasmid dna species. using filter blot hybridization, we found several plasmids which were homologous to the small beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids pjb1 and pfa7, which were originally isolated  from haemophilus ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. detailed filter hybridization studies combined with electron microscope heteroduplex analysis suggested that three cryptic plasmids are completely homologous to the non-tna sequences of pjb1. one cryptic plasmid was found to be highly homologous to pjb603, a small beta-lactamase plasmid previously found in two isolates of h. influenzae. a second group of plasmids were found to carry sequences homologous to pjb1 and other sequences homologous to pjb603. these results strongly suggest  that small beta-lactamase plasmids found in haemophilus species and n. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of the transposable beta-lactamase-specifying element tna into small, phenotypically cryptic replicons resident in h. parainfluenzae. attempts to reproduce such a recombination event in the laboratory were not successful.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of antibiotic resistance plasmids of haemophilus species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == ampicillin resistance in haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae is most commonly due to plasmid-mediated production of the tem beta-lactamase. the h. influenzae plasmids may have evolved by insertion of various antibiotic resistance transposons into a phenotypically cryptic plasmid found in one of 699  isolates of h. influenzae examined. the small, nonconjugative, beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids of n. gonorrhoeae and haemophilus species are  highly related. phenotypically cryptic plasmids found in several epidemiologically distinct isolates of haemophilus parainfluenzae are highly related to the beta-lactamase plasmids but carry no transposon a (tna) sequences. this evidence strongly favors the hypothesis that the beta-lactamase plasmids evolved by the insertion of tna (possibly introduced from enteric bacteria) into  cryptic plasmids resident in h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. a significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteroides species and fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. one beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase-production in haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae or branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli strain. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice  in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group a streptococci when previous treatment has failed.

TI  == isolation of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae from genital-tract specimens with a selective culture medium.
AB  == a series of 2027 genital tract specimens was cultured for haemophilus species on  non-selective chocolate agar and on a selective medium (choc-vbca). the latter gave a significantly higher isolation rate. h. influenzae was isolated from 27 specimens and h. parainfluenzae from 81 specimens by use of the selective medium. the biotype distribution of both species was compared with that of an equal number of isolates from respiratory-tract secretions. h. influenzae biotypes ii and iv were found to predominate in genital strains and biotypes ii and iii in respiratory strains. with h. parainfluenzae, biotype ii was most frequent in both sites. two new biotypes of h. parainfluenzae (vi and vii) are described. the significance of the use of selective media and of biotype distribution are discussed.

TI  == use of dot-immunobinding and immunofluorescence assays to investigate clinically  suspected cases of chancroid.
AB  == in 1984 and 1985, outbreaks of genital ulcers occurred in florida and new york. initial investigations for syphilis, herpes simplex, chlamydia trachomatis, and haemophilus ducreyi did not implicate any of these organisms as etiologic agents. from the results of dot-immunobinding assays, we found that sera from the patients had higher levels of igm (30 [47.6%] of 63 patients) and igg (22 [34.9%] of 63 patients) reactivities with an outer-membrane preparation from h. ducreyi strain cip542 than with outer-membrane preparations from haemophilus influenzae atcc 10211 or haemophilus parainfluenzae atcc 7901. in contrast, sera from 35 patients in the control group did not react with any of the outer-membrane preparations (p less than .01 for both igm and and igg reactivity), nor did sera  from eight individuals with disease caused by h. influenzae (p = .051 for igm reactivity, p = .02 for igg reactivity). indirect immunofluorescence assay using  a monoclonal antibody reactive with outer-membrane preparations from h. ducreyi strain cip542 stained organisms in smears of lesion material from genital ulcers  from three of six patients. these results suggested that the cause of both outbreaks of genital ulcers was h. ducreyi which was subsequently isolated in both geographic areas.

TI  == characterisation of haemophilus spp. isolated from infant conjunctivitis.
AB  == haemophilus strains isolated from children under the age of 11 months with conjunctivitis were characterised by biotype, sugar fermentation, plasmid pattern and outer-membrane-protein profiles. h. influenzae was the most common species identified and was separated into 14 groups based on sugar fermentation and biotype patterns and into more than 20 groups when plasmid and outer-membrane-protein profiles were included. small (mol. wt less than 10 x 10(6)) plasmids were identified in 11 of 34 (32%) h. influenzae isolates, 1 of 2  h. haemolyticus and 4 of 6 (67%) h. parainfluenzae isolates. examination of sugar-fermentation and plasmid patterns increased the ability to distinguish between strains isolated at different times from recurrent disease and may have general applications in the study of haemophilus strains isolated from a single anatomical site.

TI  == josamycin: interpretation of inhibition zones with the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion test as compared with erythromycin.

AB  == serum antibody titers to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were measured in 200 subjects by an enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay (elisa) using whole microorganisms as antigen. comparisons were made between titers found in periodontally normal subjects and titers in subjects with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), postlocalized juvenile periodontitis, generalized juvenile periodontitis or adult periodontitis. it was found that titers to all three serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in ljp patients' sera, while  serum antibody levels in other diseased groups were not significantly elevated to any of the serotypes. patient sera were also examined for serum antibody to oral  haemophili previously shown to cross-react with a. actinomycetemcomitans. similar antibody titers were found in both normal subjects and in patients with various forms of periodontal disease to haemophilus aphrophilus, h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae. the a. actinomycetemcomitans antibodies which were elevated in ljp patients could not be correlated with antibody titers to cross-reacting haemophili, suggesting that these antibodies are a. actinomycetemcomitans-specific. serum antibody responses in six of the ljp patients were assessed to autologous strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. each patient was found to be infected with only a single serotype of a. actinomycetemcomitans, and specific antibodies to the infecting serotype were found in the patients' sera. in families, the ljp patients had significantly elevated igg, iga and igm serum antibody titers to a. actinomycetemcomitans, while the igg and iga antibody titers in periodontally normal siblings were at levels comparable to those found in normal subjects. however, igm serum antibodies were elevated in the periodontally normal siblings of ljp patients suggesting that the formation of igm antibodies to a. actinomycetemcomitans may precede the clinical appearance of localized juvenile periodontitis. gingival crevicular fluid and serum antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans were compared in ljp patients. comparable titers of igg, iga and igm antibodies were found in serum and gingival fluid in most subjects; however, gingival fluid samples sometimes showed higher titers than serum, likely resulting from local antibody synthesis. the value of serum antibody determinations to a. actinomycetemcomitans in the diagnosis of actinobacillus-associated periodontitis was also assessed. the predictive value of a positive test (significantly elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans igg) was 86%, while the specificity was 89%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparison of transformation mechanisms of haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == transformation pathways in two closely related bacterial species, haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus influenzae, were studied. both organisms rapidly take up transforming dna within minutes into specialized membranous structures on the cell surface (transformasomes). dna within transformasomes is in a protected  state, inaccessible to external dnase or internal restriction and modification enzymes. however, the subsequent processing of donor dna differs in these two organisms. in h. influenzae, linear dna immediately undergoes degradation from one end at a constant rate, leaving a lower-molecular-weight intermediate in the  transformasome. the end undergoing degradation is searching for homologous regions of the chromosome. once pairing is initiated, the remaining lower-molecular-weight dna exits from the transformasome, and a single strand undergoes efficient integration. in contrast, in h. parainfluenzae little degradation of donor dna is observed, with the majority remaining intact within the transformasomes after 1 h. thus, whereas only 10% of donor dna molecules leave the protected state after 1 h, portions of each molecule appear to become quantitatively integrated.

AB  == annual ampicillin susceptibility rates for haemophilus influenzae isolates at the st. paul-ramsey medical center gradually decreased from 100% in 1974 to 83.3% in  1980 and then remained stable at 88.90%. penicillin susceptibility rates were similar to those for ampicillin. ampicillin rates were source dependent: eye 95%, respiratory 90%, miscellaneous sources 82%, and blood and csf 80%. rates for haemophilus parainfluenzae varied and showed no trend. h. parainfluenzae isolates were distinctly less susceptible to penicillin (70%) than to ampicillin (96%). h. influenzae isolates were highly susceptible to chloramphenicol (99.6%) and tetracycline (97.5%), with the latter also showing source dependency. characterization of isolates for colony morphology and hemolysis showed no clinical relevancy. ampicillin and penicillin mics were determined for 128 clinical isolates saved in stock culture during 1978-1983. all 19 resistant isolates (mic greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml) were resistant to both penicillin and ampicillin and produced beta-lactamase. eight had penicillin mics  of 1 or 2 micrograms/ml and three had ampicillin mics of 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. the significance of isolates with mics of 1-2 micrograms/ml is discussed in relation to our findings and a review of the literature.

TI  == treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  == one hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): neisseria meningitidis in 42, streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, haemophilus influenzae in 16, salmonella spp. in 7, staphylococcus aureus in 2, enterobacter  spp. in 2 and haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. all isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with mic's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. one hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an  aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. one hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. three patients had sequelae. most (88.5%) had sterile csf within 72 h after starting treatment. eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. the only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. the study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.

TI  == the acid end-products of glucose metabolism of oral and other haemophili.
AB  == the acids produced in broth culture by various species of oral haemophili and by  stock strains of capsulated and other haemophili were identified and measured by  gas-liquid chromatography. succinic acid was the major acid end-product of all strains, with acetic acid also being regularly produced but in smaller amounts. a stock strain, haemophilus parainfluenzae nctc 4101, produced less succinic acid than other strains of haemophili. strain nctc 4101 possessed all the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as previously reported, but in the other haemophili examined only succinic dehydrogenase, fumarase and malate dehydrogenase could be  detected. no other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were detected and isocitrate lyase, malate synthase and pyruvate carboxylase were also absent. phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxylase was present in all strains. a partial tricarboxylic acid cycle and marked malate dehydrogenase activity appear to be characteristic of haemophili. the pathway to succinate in haemophili appears to be via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxalacetate and thence via malate  and fumarate. the results of tracer studies on a single oral strain of h. parainfluenzae using various labelled substrates were in keeping with this proposed metabolic pathway.

TI  == antibiotic treatment of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == during the period 1977-81, 188 cystic fibrosis patients have been treated with 1  254 anti-haemophilus treatments in the danish cystic fibrosis center. on an average, each patient received 1.7 courses of chemotherapy per year. haemophilus  infections were more prevalent in the youngest age group of patients. the average number of h. influenzae precipitins increased with age, and this pattern was consistent throughout the whole study. the standard treatment was orally administered pivampicillin or amoxicillin given for 14 days. 1 case of allergy or ampicillin-resistant strains, erythromycin was given, in most cases alone, in some cases in combination with rifampicin. the overall results showed, that h. influenzae was eradicated from sputum by a single course of chemotherapy in 73% of the courses and h. parainfluenzae in 100% of the courses. six per cent of the  patients suffered from chronic h. influenzae infection in spite of repeated treatments. no decrease of treatment efficiency was found even after many repeated chemotherapy courses. the prevalence of patients harbouring ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae increased in the beginning of the period (6%-20%), but a slight fall was subsequently observed.

TI  == fimbriation of haemophilus species isolated from the respiratory tract of adults.
AB  == twenty-two clinical isolates of haemophilus species were studied within two passages of their original isolation for the presence of fimbriae by negative-staining electron microscopy. six isolates were identified as fimbriated, including three strains of nontypable haemophilus influenzae, one strain of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and two strains of haemophilus haemolyticus. in fresh isolates of fimbriated strains of nontypable h. influenzae, approximately 40%-50% of cells had fimbriae; after five passages in vitro, less than 1% of the cells had fimbriae. thus, a variety of haemophilus species that colonize the human respiratory tract can be fimbriated, and this fimbriation is rapidly lost on passage in vitro.

TI  == relative proportions of haemophilus species in the throat of healthy children and adults.
AB  == to determine normal proportions of pharyngeal haemophilus species, qualitative and quantitative mapping of the species in the pharynx of ten healthy children and ten healthy adults was carried out using a selective and a non-selective medium. haemophilus organisms were present in all samples, comprising approximately 10% of the total cultivable flora (range 0.6-36.9%). haemophilus parainfluenzae was a member of the normal flora throughout life, constituting 74% of pharyngeal haemophilus organisms. haemophilus segnis and haemophilus paraphrophilus occurred more frequently in samples from adults, whereas haemophilus haemolyticus was present in only one sample. non-encapsulated haemophilus influenzae strains, usually of multiple biotypes, were present in 80% of the children but accounted for a mean of only 1.8% of the total flora. their number decreased with increasing age; 40% of the adults harbored haemophilus influenzae but only of a single biotype which constituted a minor proportion of the total flora (mean 0.15%). these findings suggest that host mechanisms can influence changes in the proportions of haemophilus influenzae strains colonizing the host.

TI  == acute hemophilus parainfluenzae epiglottitis in an adult.
AB  == a 60-year-old man, who had non-insulin-dependent diabetes but was otherwise in good health, was hospitalized for sudden upper airway obstruction and respiratory arrest. findings on fiberoptic laryngoscopy were consistent with acute epiglottitis. blood cultures and factor analysis later revealed that the responsible pathogen was hemophilus parainfluenzae. acute epiglottitis in the adult is no longer considered rare and is usually attributed to h influenzae. the case described here and two other cases reported elsewhere indicate that h parainfluenzae may also be a cause of this serious and often fatal infection of the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  == we treated four adults whose upper airway was compromised due to acute epiglottitis. we also reviewed the english literature for all reports of this condition in adults (18 years and older). among the 158 cases, the infectious etiology was identified in 29 (h. influenzae 20, streptococcus pneumoniae six, h. parainfluenzae two, streptococcus pyogenes one). in the remaining cases, the etiology was uncertain. bacteremia was documented in 23/32 patients (71.9%), but  extra-epiglottic infections were strikingly rare (x = six). the clinical manifestations were sore throat (100%), fever (88%), dyspnea (78%), dysphagia (76%), anterior neck cellulitis or tenderness (27%), hoarseness (21%), pharyngitis (20%) and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (9%). complete airway obstruction ensued in 23 out of the 119 subjects (18.3%) who had respiratory difficulty. overall mortality rate was 17.6% but it was 6.4% among the patients who were semi-electively tracheostomized or endotracheally intubated. these findings illustrate that antibiotics therapy active against h. influenzae is required in the treatment of acute epiglottitis in adults. additionally, airway patency should be established when inspiratory stridor appears assuring uncomplicated recovery.

TI  == heterospecific transformation in the genus haemophilus.
AB  == the relationship between nine haemophilus species and haemophilus influenzae was  studied by dna-dna hybridization, by transformation of h. influenzae to streptomycin resistance with heterospecific dna, by competition of heterospecific dna for transformation by homospecific dna and by the lethal effect of heterospecific dna on competent h. influenzae. h. parainfluenzae, h. parasuis, and h. aegyptius dna transformed at more than 10% efficiency when compared to homologous transformation, but only h. aegyptius demonstrated, by hybridization,  a relative binding ratio of more than 80%. h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus dna demonstrated a relative binding ratio of less than 30% and transformed h. influenzae at only 10(-5) the efficiency of homologous dna, but they competed for h. influenzae transformation as well as or better than homospecific dna. the data indicated that in some of the species sharing the common ecological habitat of the mammalian respiratory tract, sequences necessary for competition and efficient uptake into h. influenzae are present in large numbers in their dnas, which nevertheless have little overall homology with h. influenzae dna.

TI  == the use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  == despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus aprophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, listeria monocytogenes. oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating s. aureus endocarditis. carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. the cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. there have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. they have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.

TI  == aspects of the pathogenicity of some oral and other haemophili.
AB  == the pathogenicity of the predominantly non-capsulated, v-factor requiring haemophili that are commonly recovered from oral infections has been explored by  studies of their endotoxins and infectivity as compared with those of haemophilus influenzae. similar yields of endotoxin (2.40-2.59% w/w) were obtained from all the haemophili examined except h. haemolyticus (1.61% w/w). the lipopolysaccharide (lps) extracts all contained heptoses but not 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (kdo). the fatty acid compositions of the lipid-a fractions were essentially similar but comprised 76% of the lps in the h. influenzae type d strain tested and only 20% in the h. influenzae type b strain and some strains of h. parainfluenzae. all extracts contained arachidic acid, which may be unique to haemophili. the endotoxins from all strains produced characteristic pyrogenic and polymorph effects in rabbits. the endotoxins from the pharyngeal x- and v-factor-requiring strains had ld50 values for actinomycin-d-sensitised mice of 2.4-2.7 micrograms/kg, and were about eight times more potent than those from the oral v-factor-requiring strains (ld50 values 17.2-22.4 micrograms/ml). approximately ten thousand times more free endotoxin was detected in broth cultures of h. influenzae type b than in those of oral haemophili, and this greater endotoxin release was not associated with a greater degree of autolysis. endotoxin release from viable cells may be important in the pathogenicity of this organism. h. influenzae type b was much more potent  in producing infection in chambers implanted subcutaneously in guinea pigs than were oral strains of haemophili; only 10 type b organisms were required, compared with 9 x 10(5) of h. parainfluenzae. however, in infections maintained for 90 days, the numbers of haemophili--c. 10(7)/ml of chamber fluid--were similar for all the test strains. thus, although the oral haemophili lack special attributes  of invasiveness and resistance to host defences, they are not devoid of pathogenic potential and, if allowed to proliferate, may become an important element in an infection.

AB  == recent surveys in vancouver showed most healthy children were colonized with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae. such organisms might alter the effects of penicillins on throat bacteria by local inactivation. to test this hypothesis in vitro, three isolates of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae were each mixed on a membrane with ampicillin-sensitive strains of haemophilus influenzae type b or group a streptococcus pyogenes and exposed to ampicillin. when tested alone, susceptible strains were rapidly killed but when tested together with a beta-lactamase producer, they were protected, indicating efficient ampicillin degradation by haemophilus parainfluenzae strains. if similar interactions occur in vivo, the effects of beta-lactams on throat bacteria could be significantly altered in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae.

AB  == haemophilus influenzae is one of several bacterial pathogens known to release iga1 proteases into the extracellular environment. each h. influenzae isolate produces one of at least three distinct types of these enzymes that differ in the specific peptide bond they cleave in the hinge region of human iga1. we have isolated the gene specifying type 1 iga1 protease from a total genomic library of h. influenzae, subcloned it into plasmid vectors, and introduced these vectors into escherichia coli k-12. the enzyme synthesized by e. coli was active and had  the same specificity as that of the h. influenzae donor. unlike that of the donor, e. coli protease activity accumulated in the periplasm rather than being transported extracellularly. the position of the protease gene in h. influenzae dna and its direction of transcription was approximated by deletion mapping. tn5  insertions, and examination of the polypeptides synthesized by minicells. a 1-kilobase probe excised from the iga1 protease gene hybridized with dna restriction fragments of all h. influenzae serogroups but not with dna of a nonpathogenic h. parainfluenzae species known to be iga1 protease negative.

AB  == forty-three patients admitted to the hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with latamoxef (moxalactam) twice daily intramuscularly for 10 days. five patients received 0.5 g injections, 23 patients 1 g and 15 patients were given 2 g. three patients dropped out of the study; one died suddenly, one was treated with another antibiotic because of suspected gram-negative pneumonia and one developed pneumococcal septicaemia after the active treatment course. most strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and branhamella catarrhalis were successfully eradicated but, by day 17, there were 7 patients with reinfections with streptococcus pneumoniae. latamoxef mic values for str. pneumoniae varied from 0.03 to 2 g mg/1, but most were in the region of 1 mg/1. sputum concentrations reached approximately 1.5 mg/1 on the highest dosage but only 0.25 to 1 mg/1 on the lower doses. peak serum concentrations with the increasing doses averaged 14, 27 and 45 mg/1 respectively. the role and dosage of latamoxef in respiratory infections in the possible presence of streptococci are discussed.

TI  == erythromycin-sulfisoxazole for persistent acute otitis media due to ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == in patients with acute otitis media who had failed to improve with ampicillin therapy, 35% of haemophilus strains isolated from the middle ear were ampicillin-resistant. twenty-nine children (24 of whom had failed to respond to ampicillin) were treated with 40 mg erythromycin ethylsuccinate per kg per day and 100 to 150 mg sulfisoxazole per kg per day. middle ear exudate was cultured on chocolate and 5% sheep blood agar. twenty-three of 29 haemophilus isolates were nontypable, 10% (3 children) were type b, 2 were haemophilus parainfluenzae  and one was not typed. all strains were resistant to ampicillin by disc susceptibility testing, and 28 of 29 strains produced beta-lactamase. the minimal inhibitory concentration of ampicillin for 15 strains ranged from 3.12 to 100 micrograms/ml (median, 6.25 micrograms/ml). the erythromycin ethylsuccinate and acetyl sulfisoxazole combination was effective in treatment of acute otitis media secondary to ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae. after 10 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate-sulfisoxazole therapy, 18 patients had normal tympanic membranes. of 11 with middle ear effusion, 7 cleared, 3 had recurrent otitis media within 1 month and 1 had persistent otitis media with effusion. our  experience suggests the efficacy of this combination in otitis media caused by ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae.

TI  == evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids in neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus species.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae has required fundamental changes in the antimicrobial therapy of disease caused by these organisms. ampicillin resistance in both organisms is caused by plasmid mediated production of tem beta-lactamase. this enzyme is specified by a sequence of mol. wt 3.2 x 10(6) which is capable of inserting itself at multiple sites in dna replicons without the requirement for significant base sequence homology between donor and recipient replicon. further, it does so without requirement for conventional recombination enzymes. analysis of beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of h. influenzae show that they generally have a molecular mass in the order of 30 x 10(6) and contain the complete tna sequence. they are conjugative but are incapable of mobilizing smaller beta-lactamase plasmids. previous studies have presented evidence suggesting that these plasmids may have evolved by insertion of the tna sequence (perhaps introduced from enteric bacteria) into a phenotypically cryptic plasmid of mol. wt 27 x 10(6) resident in rare strains of h. influenzae. in this study, we review data showing a high degree of homology between the small (3--7 x 10(6) mol. wt),  nonconjugative beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of n. gonorrhoeae, h. parainfluenzae and h. ducreyl and present new evidence that cryptic plasmids highly homologous to the beta-lactamase plasmids are present in many strains of h. parainfluenzae. this suggests that the small beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi and n. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of tna into phenotypically cryptic plasmids present in h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae: comparison of respiratory tract isolates with genitourinary tract isolates.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates recovered from the genitourinary (gu) tract were  shown to have a significantly different biotype distribution compared with respiratory tract isolates. biotype iv strains were recovered more commonly from  the gu tract, and most strains were non-serotypable. antibiotic-susceptible strains isolated from the gu tract more frequently harbored plasmids of less than 10 megadaltons than did antibiotic-susceptible respiratory tract strains. one 2.8-megadalton plasmid resident in a gu tract isolate and one 1.8-megadalton plasmid resident in a respiratory tract isolate were shown to be related to the small ampicillin resistance plasmids previously described in h. influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus ducreyi, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. this  supports the suggestion that these ampicillin resistance plasmids originated by transposition or recombination of the ampicillin transposon (tna) with cryptic endogenous haemophilus plasmids.

TI  == characterization of ampicillin-resistant haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == carriage of ampicillin-resistant (ampr) haemophilus parainfluenzae has become frequent among children in our community, although carriage of ampr haemophilus influenzae remains uncommon. in this study we characterized the mechanism of ampicillin resistance in 27 representative isolates of h. parainfluenzae. as determined by isoelectric focusing, each isolate had a tem-1 beta-lactamase; substrate profiles assessed for enzymes from 10 strains were also consistent with tem-1 enzyme. agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a plasmid of 23 to 34 megadaltons in each isolate and a small plasmid (less than or equal to 4 megadaltons) in 14 isolates. transfer of ampicillin resistance to h. influenzae rd was achieved during membrane mating with 14 of 15 donors. the transconjugants  exhibited high-level ampicillin resistance (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml), which was stable despite serial passage of isolates on antibiotic-free media. the transconjugants tested retained fertility. cryptic plasmids were discovered in 7 of 25 antibiotic-susceptible h. parainfluenzae isolates. our data suggest that h. parainfluenzae may play an important role in the exchange of ampr genes among throat bacteria.

AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == chromosomally integrated conjugative plasmids are common in antibiotic-resistant  haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == twenty-three highly antibiotic-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and two of haemophilus parainfluenzae without detectable large plasmids were examined for conjugative transfer of their resistance to h. influenzae strain rd or to other strains. very inefficient transfer was observed for 18 h. influenzae strains and 1 h. parainfluenzae strain. all h. influenzae transcipients carried a large plasmid, and they were in turn efficient donors of their resistances in standard conjugation crosses with isogenic recipients. this was not seen for the  h. parainfluenzae transcipients. it is concluded that most of the original antibiotic-resistant cultures carried an integrated conjugative r plasmid which had been excised in a few cells in each population. it was these cells which transferred resistance in the primary crosses.

TI  == trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of otitis media secondary to ampicillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == between august 1977 and january 1979, 16 children (7 males and 9 females) ranging in age from 5 to 38 months (mean age 18 months) were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx) (40 mg/kg smx per 24 hours) for otitis media caused by beta-lactamase strains of ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae. fourteen patients had failed after antecedent ten-day courses of ampicillin (9 patients) or amoxicillin (5 patients) therapy. the remaining two patients received only five days of ampicillin before changing to tmp-smx. six of the isolates were nontypable, 3 were type b, 5 isolates were haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 2 strains were unavailable for typing. of 13 strains tested,  10 had a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in excess of 3.12 microgram/ml of ampicillin; the remaining 3 had an mic of < 3.12 microgram/ml. all 13 isolates were susceptible to 0.19 microgram/ml tmp-smx. five of 16 children were symptomatic (irritable; fever of > 38.2 c); within three days of starting tmp-smx treatment, they became asymptomatic. fifteen of 16 patients (93%) responded favorably after ten days of tmp-smx. only one patient had h influenzae resistant  to ampicillin (12.5 microgram/ml) and sensitive to tmp-smx (0.19 microgram/ml) isolated from the middle ear at the end of ten days of tmp-smx. at the end of tmp-smx therapy, middle ear effusions were noted in ten patients; the fluid was sterile in the four patients who had a second tympanocentesis. there were two recurrences within one month of tmp-smx therapy. no adverse clinical reactions were noted.

AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of haemophilus species in patients with chronic bronchitis.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae strains resistant to ampicillin have become an important cause of disease in pediatric patients. because many adults with chronic bronchitis carry haemophilus organisms in their tracheobronchial tree and because antimicrobial agents are used commonly in these patients, we assessed the prevalence of resistance to ampicillin and other antimicrobial agents in this population. we studied 150 haemophilus isolates (73 h. influenzae, 69 h. parainfluenzae, 6 h. parahemolyticus, and 2 h. hemolyticus) obtained from 138 patients with chronic bronchitis from january 1978 through march 1979. ampicillin resistance due to production of beta-lactamase was found in 7 of the 150 isolates (4.7 %)-2 h. influenzae, 4 h. parainfluenzae and 1 h. parahemolyticus. resistance to tetracycline was found in 9 strains (6 %), but all strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol.

TI  == sequence-specific dna uptake in haemophilus transformation.
AB  == haemophilus cells efficiently take up haemophilus dna from the medium during transformation but do not take up other dnas. to study the mechanism of this specificity we have cloned an 8.1-kilobase (kb) fragment of h. parainfluenzae dna in the escherichia coli--pbr322 host--vector system and reisolated the dna fragment for use as a defined probe. the 5'32p end-labeled 8.1-kb dna is efficiently absorbed by competent haemophilus cells whereas vector dna present in the mixture is not, implying that the 8.1-kb dna contains sequence-specific recognition sites that are needed for dna uptake. absorbed dna can be recovered from cells as a 32p-labeled duplex of unaltered size for several minutes after uptake. we have determined the number and location of uptake sites in the 8.1-kb  dna by constructing a restriction endonuclease cleavage map and assaying fragments for uptake. only two small fragments retain the ability to be absorbed. these fragments, 120 and 140 base pairs long, are 3.8 kb apart on the 8.1-kb fragment. we assume that each of these fragments contains a short common sequence, perhaps 8--12 base pairs long, that is the actual recognition site. we  have shown by dna competition assays, with the 8.1-kb dna as a standard, that about 600 copies of the uptake sites are present in the haemophilus genome.

AB  == tetracycline resistance in a strain of haemophilus influenzae isolated in the united kingdom was found to be determined by an apparently non-selftransmissible  plasmid of 31 x 10(6) daltons (31 mdal), designated pub701. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization studies indicated that pub701 shares about 70% base sequence homology with the 30-mdal ampicillin resistance r plasmid rsf007 isolated in the  united states from h. influenzae, and 64% sequence homology with the 38-mdal tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance r plasmid pri234, isolated in the netherlands. heteroduplex studies between rsf007 and pub701 confirmed the fact that these plasmids were largely homologous, except that pub701 contained the tetracycline resistance transposon tnd, whereas rsf007 contained the ampicillin resistance transposon tna. a strain of h. parainfluenzae resistant to both chloramphenicol and tetracycline carried two species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic  acid of 2.7 and 0.75 mdal. we were unable to prove that either resistance was plasmid-borne in this strain. hybridization studies with a [3h]thymine-labeled tetracycline resistance enteric plasmid suggested that the tetracycline transposon was integrated into the chromosome of h. parainfluenzae ub2832. we conclude either that the strains we studied received r factors of the same incompatibility group bearing different resistance genes, or that different resistance genes were translocated to a commom resident plasmid of h. influenzae.

TI  == [drug sensitivity of haemophilus sp. and transfer of resistance into e. coli (author's transl)].
AB  == from june 1973 to july 1976, 742 strains of haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, isolated from clinical specimens, were routinely tested for in vitro sensitivity to twelve antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclin, minocyclin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazol, trimethoprim. 61 strains were found resistant to one or more of these antibiotics (ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracyclin). the mics of 23 antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method on most of the resistant strains and on 60 sensitive strains isolated during the same period and considered as control. 21 strains transferred their resistance determinants into e. coli k12; 23 plasmids were obtained isolated from these strains: 2 strains contained two different plasmids. 90% of the transconjugants were stable after repeated subcultures.

TI  == haemophilus endocarditis. report of 14 patients.
AB  == from 1963 through december 1976, 14 patients with haemophilus endocarditis were seen, 10 since january 1972. four different species representing 15 isolates were cultured from the 14 patients: h. influenzae (1), h. aphrophilus (5), h. paraphrophilus (5), and h. parainfluenzae (4). one patient had infection with both h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus. minimal inhibitory concentrations of 12 of the tested 14 strains with ampicillin were 1.25 mug/ml or less. tube dilution tests were not possible for minimal bactericidal concentrations (7 times) or serum bactericidal titers (5 times) of the 12 tested strains. the clinical picture varied from an insidious onset and mild uncomplicated disease to abrupt onset with severe multisystem disease. twelve patients had murmurs on admission; congestive heart failure was absent in all 14 but embolization occurred in 6. treatment periods of 3 to 7 weeks consisted of penicillin g or ampicillin plus aminoglycoside in nine patients and ampicillin alone in five. all 14 patients were cured; no relapses occurred. value surgery was not needed for bacteriologic cure but was necessary 15 days after therapy in one patient and in  four others from 12 to 22 months after therapy. we believe that ampicillin, 12 g/day alone for 3 weeks, is adequate treatment for haemophilus endocarditis.

TI  == bactericidal factor produced by haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  == when aerobically grown on complex media, haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other haemophilus species and certain genera of the enterobacteriaceae. a total of 341 clinical isolates of haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. ninety-three percent of h. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of h. haemolyticus, 71% of h. parainfluenzae, and 22% of h. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. h. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and h. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. only one strain each of h. aegyptius and h. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of escherichia coli, 85% of salmonella sp., and all citrobacter sp., shigella sp., and yersinia  sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by h. influenzae b. attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. however, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown h. influenzae b by a series of extractions. the ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. the converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed h. influenzae rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of h. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of h. influenzae b.

TI  == interaction of rna polymerase with promoters from bacteriophage fd.
AB  == replicative form dna of bacteriophage fd, which had been fragmented with the restriction endonuclease ii from hemophilus parainfluenzae (endo r- hpaii), was reacted with escherichia coli rna polymerase; the resulting stable preinitiation  complexes were analysed using the filter binding assay followed by gel electrophoresis. at 120mm kcl the first-order rate constants for complex decay were determined to be 10(-2)-10(-6)s-1. the second-order rate constants for complex formation were found to be about 10(6) -10(7) m-1 s-1. from these values  association constants for the individual promoters were calculated to be 2 x 10(-8) -2 x 10(-11) m-1. the rate of formation and the stability of promoter complexes was enhanced in superhelical dna. no evidence was found for stable promoter-specific closed complexes consisting of enzyme and helical dna. this and the kinetic data suggest that the unwinding of base pairs is already important early in promoter selection, and not only for the formation of the final open complex. the initiation of rna synthesis form the preinitiation complex was faster than complex dissociation and complex formation for all promoters. consequently, the initiation efficiency of a promoter is determined by the rate of complex formation, and not by its 'affinity' for the enzyme. no correlation was found between the relative order of the fd promoters for the binding and the  dissociation reaction. this is explained by different structural determinants, for the two reactions, which are located in different parts of the promoter dna.

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae and influenzae endocarditis: a review of forty cases.
AB  == two cases of bacterial endocarditis caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae are reported with a review of 33 other cases of h. parainfluenzae endocarditis and 5  cases of h. influenzae endocarditis. although h. parainfluenzae is usually considered a non-pathogenic microorganism, this review firmly establishes its role as a causative agent in endocarditis. furthermore, several clinical features were noted which were atypical when compared to findings usually present in patients with bacterial endocarditis. the mean age of the patients was only 27 years. over 60% of the patients had no identifiable predisposing illness, an unexpected finding in view of the low degree of pathogenicity associated with this microorganism. polymicrobial bacteremia, usually with viridans streptococci, was found in 11% of patients. major arterial emboli were documented in 57% of patients, an incidence unchanged from the pre-antibiotic era. diagnosis of the disease is dependent upon an awareness of the fastidious cultural requirements necessary for isolation of haemophilus species. culture media must contain a source of x and v factors. mortality from h. parainfluenzae endocarditis has been reduced from 100 per cent prior to 1940 to about 12 per cent by use of appropriate antimicrobial agents. awareness that haemophilus species can cause bacterial endocarditis is important because the diagnosis is dependent upon utilization of special culture methods and the patient may not respond to some of the empiric regimens used for treating bacterial endocarditis. it should be especially considered as a possible cause of "culture-negative" or "abacteremic"  endocarditis.

TI  == standardized disk-diffusion susceptibility test for haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == the emergence of ampicillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae has emphasized the need for an improved practical method for routine susceptibility testing of clinical isolates. we have previously described a simplified medium for quantitative dilution susceptibility testing that is composed of mueller-hinton medium plus supplement c (difco). in the present study, paired broth-dilution and disk-diffusion susceptibility tests with ampicillin and chloramphenicol were performed on 100 strains of haemophilus (95 h. influenzae and five h. parainfluenzae), including 30 strains with previously documented ampicillin resistance. disk-diffusion tests were performed in exactly the same manner as the standardized kirby-bauer procedure used for less fastidious organisms, except that supplemented mueller-hinton agar plates were incubated in  an increased-co2 atmosphere. using this method, ampicillin-susceptible strains of haemophilus produced zone diameters of 22 mm or more, while ampicillin-resistant  strains produced zones of 18 mm or less. all strains were chloramphenicol-susceptible and produced zone diameters of 30 mm or more. this method would allow routine disk-diffusion testing of isolates of h. influenzae by hospital diagnostic laboratories, using a clear medium that closely resembles unsupplemented mueller-hinton agar.

TI  == transfer of a plasmid-specified beta-lactamase gene from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == a number of ampicillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae could donate a gene specifying the type iiia (tem) beta-lactamase to haemophilus parainfluenzae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. donor strains rapidly lost their ability to transfer ampicillin resistance on storage or subculture. such strains  also apparently contained a single species of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of contour length 1.2 mum, equivalent to about 2.5 x 10(6)  daltons. no species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid large enough to encode sex factor activity was detected. despite this, transfer occurred to several bacterial genera in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that transmissibility was by conjugation. the beta-lactamase gene was generally unstable after transfer and was lost in the absence of selection. where stable transcipients were found, this was evidently by insertion of the beta-lactamase gene into the host chromosome. in p. aeruginosa insertion was always accompanied  by induction of auxotrophy for adenine, suggesting insertion at a specific site.  it is believed that insertion also occurred at one site on the chromosome of escherichia coli. crypticity measurements for beta-lactamase activity showed that there was little or no penetration barrier to beta-lactam drugs in haemophilus. this may explain the long delay in the acquisition of ampicillin resistance by this organism.

TI  == interactions between viruses and bacteria in patients with chronic bronchitis.
AB  == the possibility that viral infections of the respiratory tract might predispose to bacterial colonization or infection was studied in 120 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 control subjects; these individuals were observed for seven years. the ratio of the number of observed to the number of expected associations between viruses and bacteria was 2.43 (p = 0.037) for the pair influenza virus and streptococcus pneumoniae and was 2.06 (p = 0.056) for influenza virus and haemophilus influenzae. consistently positive, but not significant, associations were detected between rhinovirus and herpes simplex virus infections and isolations of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. in contrast,  isolations of the nonpathogenic haemophilus parainfluenzae could not be related to prior viral infections. significant rises in titer of antibody to h. influenzae were detected on 76 occasions, and 20 (26%) of these antibody rises were associated with viral or mycoplasmal infections during the preceding 120 days. the expected number of such associations was 8.34 (ratio of number observed to number expected, 2.40; p = 0.08). these results suggest that viral infections  of the respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with increased colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria and may also predispose to infections with h. influenzae.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == the importance of nonencapsulated strains of haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (c.o.p.d.) has been investigated in 150 patients observed at two-month intervals  from 1968 to 1975. h. influenzae was distinguished from h. parainfluenzae by demonstrating requirements for both x and v factors. h. influenzae was isolated more often from sputum cultures from patients with severe c.o.p.d. (13.8%) than from patients with mild disease (4.4%, p less than 0.01). in contrast, h. parainfluenzae was isolated with equal frequency from sputums of patients with mild (40%) or severe (43%) disease. h. influenzae was present in the sputum more  often during exacerbations of acute respiratory illness (15.4%) than during sympton-free periods (9.6%, p less than 0.01), while isolation rates of h. parainfluenzae did not increase during periods of illness (35% versus 39%). antigens specific for the h. influenzae species and for the h. parainfluenzae species were used in a complement-fixation test to detect antibody rises in sera  collected from the patient population. fourfold or greater rises in titre of antibodies to h. influenzae were detected on 76 occasions in 53 patients, and 46  of these rises were associated with acute respiratory illnesses. in contrast, no  antibody rises were detected with the h. parainfluenzae antigen. these observations indicate that nonencapsulated strains of h. influenzae may have pathogenic potential in patients with c.o.p.d., whilst h. parainfluenzae should be considered as normal flora.

AB  == eleven cases of hemophilus meningitis seen in the last year are reported. three were h. parainfluenzae and eight were h. influenzae. the number of patients is small but probably indicates that there is little difference in the clinical or laboratory data in meningitis caused by these two organisms. the children with h. parainfluenzae tended to be less anemic and had more normal admission spinal fluid sugars and proteins, but this was probably because these patients were older and had shorter prodromes. as more cases of h. parainfluenzae meningitis are noted, it seems likely that there will not be any difference in the clinical  or laboratory data. two of the three cases of h. parainfluenzae meningitis had the complication of ataxia secondary to severe bilateral vestibular deficits. finally, it should be noted that these two organisms will not be distinguished by routine bacteriological studies, and that differentiation must be carried out by  an experimental laboratory.

AB  == although hemophilus influenzae is a common cause of meningitis, other members of  the hemophilus genus are rarely the infecting organism. of 56 cases of meningitis due to hemophilus species obseved at one hospital in the period 1970-74, 53 were  due to h. influenzae and 3 to h. parainfluenzae. in the cases of h. parainfluenzae meningitis the clinical picture was complicated by associated sepsis, and therapy with ampicillin was not entirely satisfactory.

TI  == new satellitism test for isolation and identification of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae in sputum.
AB  == a new satellitism test designed to facilitate the isolation and identification of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae is described. in the basal  medium, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is incorporated at a concentration of 0.2 mug per ml, an amount adequate for h. influenzae but not for h. parainfluenzae. two disks are placed on the surface of the medium, one disk being impregnated with 60 mug of hemin and the other with 15 mug of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. under these conditions, h. influenzae strains grow around the hemin disk only and the majority of h. parainfluenzae grow around the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disk. this procedure gives results which are more clear cut than other established methods, especially in sputum culture.

TI  == viable deletion mutants of simian virus 40: selective isolation by means of a restriction endonuclease from hemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == resistance of simian virus 40 (sv40) dna to cleavage by hemophilus parainfluenzae ii (hpaii) restriction endonuclease has been used as a positive, in vitro selection for mutants lacking the one hpaii endonuclease-cleavage site of wild-type sv40 dna. each of 10 viable mutants isolated by this procedure multiplies significantly more slowly than wild-type virus and contains a small deletion (80 to 190 base pairs in size) of the region of the genome that includes the hpaii endonuclease-recognition sequence. these well-defined mutants, having a selective disadvantage for growth, would not have been readily obtained by conventional methods used to screen for viral mutants. therefore, in certain circumstances, restriction endonucleases are effective reagents for the selection of new classes of mutants. because these small deletions can be visualized in heteroduplexes, these mutants provide internal markers for mapping other alterations or features of the simian virus 40 genome.

TI  == a colinear map relating the simian virus 40 (sv40) dna segments of six adenovirus-sv40 hybrids to the dna fragments produced by restriction endonuclease cleavage of sv40 dna.
AB  == the simian virus 40 (sv40) dna segments present in a series of adenovirus-sv40 hybrids have been mapped with respect to the sites of cleavage of sv40 dna by restriction endonucleases. two approaches have been used. first, nucleic acid hybridizations were performed between equimolar quantities of the denatured dnas  of sv40 and each hybrid virus and the radiolabeled transcripts of 11 dna fragments obtained by cleavage of sv40 dna by restriction endonuclease from hemophilus influenzae. secondly, selected fragments of sv40 dna produced by the h. influenzae or h. parainfluenzae restriction endonucleases were used to form heteroduplex dna molecules with adenovirus and adenovirus-sv40 hybrid dna, which  were then analyzed by electron microscopy. the two sets of data were consistent and have permitted alignment of the map of the sv40 segments of the hybrid viruses with the h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae cleavage maps of sv40. since cells infected with some of the hybrid viruses contain one or more sv40-specific  antigens, the genetic determinants of these antigens could be localized on the cleavage map.

TI  == relationship between prophage induction and transformation in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == the interaction between transformation and prophages of hp1c1, s2, and a defective phage of haemophilus influenzae has been investigated by measurement of (i) the effect of prophage on transformation frequency and (ii) the effect of transformation on phage induction. the presence of any of the prophages does not  appreciably alter transformation frequencies in various rec(+) and rec(-) strains. however, exposure of competent lysogens to transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) may induce phage but only in rec(+) strains, which are able to integrate transforming dna into their genome. transformation of rec(+) lysogens with dna irradiated with ultraviolet (uv) light causes the production of even more phage than results from unirradiated dna, but this indirect uv induction is  not as effective as direct induction by uv irradiation of lysogens. both types of uv induction are influenced by the repair capacity of the host. wild-type cells contain a prophage and can be induced by transformation to produce a defective phage, which kills a small fraction of the cells. defective phage in wild-type cells are also induced by h. parainfluenzae dna, and a much larger fraction of the cells is killed. strain bc200, which is highly transformable but is not inducible for defective phage, is not killed by h. parainfluenzae dna, suggesting that wild-type cells are killed by killed by this dna because of phage induction. a minicell-producing mutant, lb11, has been isolated. some phage induction occurs in this strain when the cells are made competent, unlike the wild type. a large majority of lb11 cells surviving the competence regime are killed by exposure to  transforming dna.

TI  == separation of specific segments of transforming dna after treatment with endodeoxyribonuclease.
AB  == hemophilus parainfluenzae endodeoxyribonuclease was used to degrade the dna of h. influenzae and to follow the biological activity of 14 markers associated with this dna. it was found that some h. influenzae markers were completely inactivated by endodeoxyribonuclease treatment, while others appeared to retain all or almost all of their original activity. the bulk of the h. influenzae dna was reduced to double-stranded pieces of the order of 8 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6) daltons. velocity sedimentation of the dna in sucrose gradients disclosed that markers that retained biological activity were present in dna particles that were of the order of 1 x 10(6) daltons or larger, and indicated a close correlation between the size of the dna fragment and the amount of biological activity retained. these data suggest that h. parainfluenzae endodeoxyribonuclease breaks  dna at specific sites. the nal(r) marker was shown to have twice as much biological activity after treatment with endodeoxyribonuclease when assayed at saturating dna concentrations. in the linear portion of the dna dose-response curve, the biological activity of this marker was reduced 3- to 10-fold compared  to untreated dna (in accord with the reduced size of its dna). these data demonstrate a specific enrichment of the nal(r) marker by about 6- to 20-fold, and suggest a technique for the separation and purification of specific segments  of dna.

TI  == molecular events accompanying the fixation of genetic information in haemophilus  heterospecific transformation.
AB  == heterospecific transformation between haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae was investigated by isopycnic analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) extracts of (3)h-labeled transforming cells that had been exposed to (32)p-labeled, heavy transforming dna. the density distribution of genetic markers from the resident dna and from the donor dna was determined by transformation assay of fractions from cscl gradients, both species being used as recipients. about 50% of the (32)p atoms in h. parainfluenzae donor dna taken up  by h. influenzae cells were transferred to resident dna, and only a small amount  of the label was lost under conditions of little cell growth. there was less transfer in the reciprocal cross, and almost half of the donor label was lost. in both crosses, the transferred donor material transformed for the donor marker considerably more efficiently when assayed on the donor species than on the recipient species, indicating that at least some of the associated (32)p atoms are contained in relatively long stretches of donor dna. when the transformed cultures were incubated under growth conditions, the donor marker associated with recipient dna transformed the donor species with progressively decreasing efficiency. the data indicate that the low heterospecific transformation between  h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae may be due partly to events occurring before  association of donor and resident dna but results mostly from events that occur after the association of the two dna preparations.

TI  == transformation between haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == heterospecific transformation between haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae is from one to more than six orders of magnitude lower than homospecific transformation, depending on the marker assayed. however, the physical integration of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) in heterospecific compared with homospecific transformation is only slightly decreased. measurement of integration of ultraviolet-irradiated heterospecific transforming dna suggests that compared with homospecific dna a longer piece of heterospecific transforming dna must undergo pairing for integration to occur. heterospecific transforming dna behaves towards ultraviolet inactivation of biological activity as though it  had undergone some previous inactivation. the efficiency of heterospecific transformation can be improved by light sonic treatment of the dna or by the use  of dna containing markers which originated from the heterospecific recipient. the presence of an excision mechanism in the recipient cell does not affect killing or marker efficiency in heterospecific transformation. the data indicate that the low frequency of transformation between h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae results mostly from lethality. it is proposed that integration of heterospecific  transforming dna results in alterations in the base sequence of the recipient genome which cannot be repaired. transcription and translation of the altered dna could result in synthesis of nonfunctional essential proteins.

TI  == effect of nitrate, fumarate, and oxygen on the formation of the membrane-bound electron transport system of haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == the composition of the membrane-bound electron transport system of haemophilus parainfluenzae underwent modification in response to the terminal electron acceptor in the growth medium. h. parainfluenzae was able to grow with o(2), nitrate, fumarate, pyruvate, and substrate amounts of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) as electron acceptors. when o(2) served as the electron acceptor and its concentration was lowered below 20 mum, the bacteria formed more cytochromes b, c, a(1), a(2), and o than were present in the cells grown at 150 to 200 mum o(2). nitrate and nitrite reductase activities also appeared during growth at the low o(2) concentrations in the absence of added nitrate. cytochrome levels in cells grown anaerobically with fumarate, pyruvate, or nad as terminal acceptors were similar to those formed in cells grown at low o(2) concentrations. cells grown with nitrate had higher levels of cytochromes c, b, and o, and of nitrate and nitrite reductases, than did cells grown with the other acceptors. the formation of cytochrome oxidase a(2) was repressed by the presence of nitrate in the growth medium. the critical o(2) concentration (the o(2) concentration at  which the rate of o(2) uptake becomes demonstrably dependent on the o(2) concentration) was about 100 mum in cells grown with nitrate and about 15 mum in  cells grown with the other acceptors. a mutant of h. parainfluenzae was found to  make about 10% as much cytochrome c as the wild type, and its formation of cytochrome a(2) was not repressed by nitrate. the critical o(2) concentration of  the mutant was high when it was grown with nitrate, suggesting that the high levels of cytochrome c and the absence of cytochrome a(2) from the wild type are  not responsible for the high critical o(2) concentration. the modifications of the respiratory system induced by changing the terminal electron acceptor were inhibited by the presence of chloramphenicol, which suggests that protein synthesis is involved.

TI  == killing of haemophilus influenzae cells by integrated ultraviolet-induced lesions from transforming deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  == highly competent cultures of haemophilus influenzae are inactivated by exposure to transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) irradiated with ultraviolet light (uv). as a function of uv dose to the dna, the killing goes to a maximum and then decreases. the killing of h. influenzae by unirradiated h. parainfluenzae dna, reported by other workers, is enhanced by low doses of uv, but drops off at high  doses. since there are no such lethal effects in a strain of h. influenzae that takes up dna normally but does not integrate it, it is concluded that the killing is associated with integrated uv lesions. all the killing of wild-type cells due  to irradiated dna is eliminated by photoreactivation of the dna. the killing of an excisionless strain of h. influenzae, however, is not eliminated by maximal photoreactivation of the irradiated transforming dna. the nonphotoreactivable fraction of killing in the excisionless strain increases with increasing dose. the kinetics of the killing-dose curves may be explained only partially in terms  of uv-induced loss of integration. it is postulated that the number of pyrimidine dimers relative to other dna components integrated decreases at higher uv doses.

AB  == the in vivo chemical linkage of haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid  (dna) with the h. influenzae genome has been found to occur at a much higher level than is suggested by the low efficiency of the heterospecific transformation of an antibiotic resistance marker. this linkage, about 60% of the level with homospecific dna, was found to involve alkali-stable bonding. the amount of host dna label released (about 60%) was about the same as that released during homospecific transformation. also, over 60% of the h. influenzae cells adsorbing h. parainfluenzae dna could not form colonies upon plating. this lethality of the heterospecific transformation was not immediate but followed considerable metabolic activity of the host cells. these data are presented to show that the "limited-pairing" hypothesis may be only a partial explanation for  the low efficiency of heterospecific transformation. another hypothesis is presented which takes into account the lethal effect of this kind of transformation.

TI  == on the specificity of the desoxyribonucleic acid which induces streptomycin resistance in hemophilus.
AB  == streptomycin resistance of a high degree has been induced in sensitive populations of hemophilus influenzae and hemophilus parainfluenzae by desoxyribonucleic acids (dna's) derived from streptomycin (sm)-resistant cells of at least one heterologous species of hemophilus. the specificity of the dna which controls sm resistance has been studied within and among species of hemophilus by comparing, in a given population, the proportion of cells transformed to sm-resistant by dna's derived from highly resistant cells of heterologous type or species with the proportion changed by the dna derived from sm-resistant cells of the homologous type or species. the ratio resulting from this comparison correlates in general with the degree of kinship between recipient and donor cells suggested by accepted methods of bacteriologic classification. the numerical value of the ratio is much lower when the species of the recipient population and donor of the dna differ than when they are of the same species. the data suggest that this ratio is of value as an index of degree of kinship of  recipient and donor cells. comparison of the activity of heterologous and homologous dna's shows differences within species and degrees of differences among species not brought out by other available methods. the data suggest that h. influenzae is more closely related to h. parainfluenzae than to h. suis and that the relationship between h. parainfluenzae and h. suis is remote. within the species h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae the ratio of hetero-specific transformants to homospecific transformants appears to be relatively constant for a given recipient population. this ratio also appears to be independent of the type or group source of the heterologous species sm resistance dna. the low proportion of cells in h. influenzae populations which are transformed to sm-resistant by dna's derived from sm-resistant h. parainfluenzae and vice versa  has been increased 4- to 15-fold by the replication of the heterologous species sm resistance dna in the heterologous species. an alteration of the heterologous  dna by the host is suggested.

TI  == studies on the hemophilus group of organisms; quantitative aspects of growth on various porphin compounds.
AB  == the porphin requirements of the hemophilus organisms have been studied. organisms of the parainfluenzae group show quantitative differences in their ability to synthesize heme. the ability of the parainfluenzae organisms to grow appears to depend on the rate with which they synthesize heme and in part at least on the properties of the medium to protect the heme from peroxidative breakdown. quantitative studies of the growth of h. influenzae turner on various iron porphins have been made. iron protoporphin gives greatest growth when supplied in excess, although iron mesoporphin appears more efficient at lower concentrations. iron deutero- and iron hematoporphin are much less effective. this suggests that  although the vinyl groups are not essential for growth of the turner organism they may be required for some particular enzymes which aid in attaining maximum growth. a number of substances potentiate the growth-promoting properties of iron porphins. these substances include reducing agents and agents which destroy h(2)o(2). e. influenzae turner appears to require heme for anaerobic as well as aerobic growth. the possibility of an essential heme enzyme functioning under anaerobic conditions must therefore be considered.
