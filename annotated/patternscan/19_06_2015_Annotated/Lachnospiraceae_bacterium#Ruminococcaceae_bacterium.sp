TI  == diversity of the intestinal bacteria of cattle fed on diets with different doses  of gelatinized starch-urea.
AB  == gelatinized starch-urea (starea, su) is an effective and economical source of urea for ruminants. here we assessed the influence of dietary supplementation with gelatinized starch-urea on the diversity of intestinal bacteria in finishing cattle. fifty steers were randomly allotted to five treatments with diets supplemented with different doses of starea [0 % (su0), 8 % (su8), 16 % (su16), 24 % (su24), and 32 % (su32) of urea-n in total nitrogen]. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes was used to examine the effect of dietary supplementation of starea on intestinal bacterial flora. shannon-weaver and simpson diversity indices consistently showed the lowest bacterial diversity  in the su0 treatment. increasing doses of starea increased the diversity up to su24 after which, diversity decreased. cluster analysis of 16s rrna gene dgge profiles indicates that the intestinal bacterial communities associated with cattle that were not supplemented with starea in feed differed in composition and structure from those supplemented with starea. the amount of starea supplemented  in cattle diets influenced the abundance of several key species affiliated with lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, peptostreptococcaceae, comamonadaceae and moraxellaceae. these results suggest that starea influences the composition and structure of intestinal bacteria which may play a role in promoting ruminant health and production performance.

TI  == gut microbiota: its role in hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == ammonia, a key factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (he), is predominantly derived from urea breakdown by urease producing large intestinal bacteria and from small intestine and kidneys, where the enzyme glutaminases releases ammonia from circulating glutamine. non-culture techniques like pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid are used to characterize fecal microbiota. fecal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis have been shown to alter with increasing child-turcotte-pugh (ctp) and model for end stage liver disease (meld) scores, and with development of covert or overt he. cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (cdr), the ratio of autochthonous/good bacteria (e.g. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae and clostridiales) to non-autochthonous/pathogenic bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae and streptococcaceae), is significantly higher in controls and patients with compensated cirrhosis than patients with decompensated cirrhosis. although their  stool microbiota do not differ, sigmoid colonic mucosal microbiota in liver cirrhosis patients with and without he, are different. linkage of pathogenic colonic mucosal bacteria with poor cognition and inflammation suggests that important processes at the mucosal interface, such as bacterial translocation and immune dysfunction, are involved in the pathogenesis of he. fecal microbiome composition does not change significantly when he is treated with lactulose or when he recurs after lactulose withdrawal. despite improving cognition and endotoxemia as well as shifting positive correlation of pathogenic bacteria with  metabolites, linked to ammonia, aromatic amino acids and oxidative stress, to a negative correlation, rifaximin changes gut microbiome composition only modestly. these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of lactulose and rifaximin could be associated with a change in microbial metabolic function as well as an improvement in dysbiosis.

TI  == gut metabolites and bacterial community networks during a pilot intervention study with flaxseeds in healthy adult men.
AB  == scope: flaxseeds contain the phytoestrogens lignans that must be activated to enterolignans by intestinal bacteria. we investigated the impact of flaxseeds on  fecal bacterial communities and their associations with fecal and blood metabolites. methods and results: nine healthy male adult subjects ingested 0.3 g/kg/day flaxseeds during 1 week. gut bacteria as well as blood and fecal metabolites were analyzed. ingestion of flaxseeds triggered a significant increase in the blood concentration of enterolignans, accompanied by fecal excretion of propionate and glycerol. overall diversity and composition of dominant fecal bacteria remained individual specific throughout the study. enterolactone production was linked to the abundance of two molecular species identified as ruminococcus bromii and ruminococcus lactaris. most dominant species of the order bacteroidales were positively associated with fecal concentrations of either acetic, isovaleric, or isobutyric acid, the latter being negatively correlated with blood levels of triglycerides. the relative sequence abundance of one gemmiger species (ruminococcaceae) and of coprococcus comes (lachnospiraceae) correlated positively with blood levels of ldl cholesterol and  triglycerides, respectively. conclusion: flaxseeds increase enterolignan production but do not markedly alter fecal metabolome and dominant bacterial communities. the data underline the possible role of members of the family ruminococcaceae in the regulation of enterolignan production and blood lipids.

TI  == a novel microbial source tracking microarray for pathogen detection and fecal source identification in environmental systems.
AB  == pathogen detection and the identification of fecal contamination sources are challenging in environmental waters. factors including pathogen diversity and ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria hamper risk assessment and remediation of contamination sources. a custom microarray targeting pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), microbial source tracking (mst) markers, and antibiotic resistance genes was tested against dna obtained from whole genome amplification  (wga) of rna and dna from sewage and animal (avian, cattle, poultry, and swine) feces. perfect and mismatch probes established the specificity of the microarray  in sewage, and fluorescence decrease of positive probes over a 1:10 dilution series demonstrated semiquantitative measurement. pathogens, including norovirus, campylobacter fetus, helicobacter pylori, salmonella enterica, and giardia lamblia were detected in sewage, as well as mst markers and resistance genes to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and tetracycline. sensitivity (percentage true positives) of mst results in sewage and animal waste samples (21-33%) was lower than specificity (83-90%, percentage of true negatives). next generation dna sequencing revealed two dominant bacterial families that were common to all sample types: ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae. five dominant phyla and 15 dominant families comprised 97% and 74%, respectively, of sequences from all fecal sources. phyla and families not represented on the microarray are possible  candidates for inclusion in subsequent array designs.

TI  == essential oils affect populations of some rumen bacteria in vitro as revealed by  microarray (rumenbactarray) analysis.
AB  == in a previous study origanum oil (oro), garlic oil (gao), and peppermint oil (peo) were shown to effectively lower methane production, decrease abundance of methanogens, and change abundances of several bacterial populations important to  feed digestion in vitro. in this study, the impact of these essential oils (eos,  at 0.50 g/l) on the rumen bacterial community composition and population was further examined using the recently developed rumenbactarray. species richness (expressed as number of operational taxonomic units, otus) in the phylum firmicutes, especially those in the class clostridia, was decreased by oro and gao, but increased by peo, while that in the phylum bacteroidetes was increased by oro and peo. species richness in the genus butyrivibrio was lowered by all the eos. increases of bacteroidetes otus mainly resulted from increases of prevotella otus. overall, 67 individual otus showed significant differences (p </= 0.05) in  relative abundance across the eo treatments. the predominant otus affected by eos were diverse, including those related to syntrophococcus sucromutans, succiniclasticum ruminis, and lachnobacterium bovis, and those classified to prevotella, clostridium, roseburia, pseudobutyrivibrio, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, prevotellaceae, bacteroidales, and clostridiales. in total, 60 otus were found significantly (p </= 0.05) correlated with feed degradability, ammonia concentration, and molar percentage of volatile fatty acids. taken together, this study demonstrated extensive impact of eos on rumen bacterial communities in an eo type-dependent manner, especially those in the predominant families prevotellaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae. the information from this study may aid in understanding the effect of eos on feed digestion and  fermentation by rumen bacteria.

TI  == sewage reflects the microbiomes of human populations.
AB  == molecular characterizations of the gut microbiome from individual human stool samples have identified community patterns that correlate with age, disease, diet, and other human characteristics, but resources for marker gene studies that consider microbiome trends among human populations scale with the number of individuals sampled from each population. as an alternative strategy for sampling populations, we examined whether sewage accurately reflects the microbial community of a mixture of stool samples. we used oligotyping of high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequence data to compare the bacterial distribution in a stool data set to a sewage influent data set from 71 u.s. cities. on average, only 15% of sewage sample sequence reads were attributed to human fecal origin, but sewage recaptured most (97%) human fecal oligotypes. the most common oligotypes in stool matched the most common and abundant in sewage. after informatically separating sequences of human fecal origin, sewage samples exhibited ~3x greater diversity than stool samples. comparisons among municipal sewage communities revealed the ubiquitous and abundant occurrence of 27 human fecal oligotypes, representing an  apparent core set of organisms in u.s. populations. the fecal community variability among u.s. populations was significantly lower than among individuals. it clustered into three primary community structures distinguished by oligotypes from either: bacteroidaceae, prevotellaceae, or lachnospiraceae/ruminococcaceae. these distribution patterns reflected human population variation and predicted whether samples represented lean or obese populations with 81 to 89% accuracy. our findings demonstrate that sewage represents the fecal microbial community of human populations and captures population-level traits of the human microbiome. importance: the gut microbiota serves important functions in healthy humans. numerous projects aim to define a healthy gut microbiome and its association with health states. however, financial considerations and privacy concerns limit the number of individuals who can be screened. by analyzing sewage from 71 cities, we demonstrate that geographically  distributed u.s. populations share a small set of bacteria whose members represent various common community states within u.s. adults. cities were differentiated by their sewage bacterial communities, and the community structures were good predictors of a city's estimated level of obesity. our approach demonstrates the use of sewage as a means to sample the fecal microbiota from millions of people and its potential to elucidate microbiome patterns associated with human demographics.

TI  == intestinal microbial dysbiosis and colonic epithelial cell hyperproliferation by  dietary alpha-mangostin is independent of mouse strain.
AB  == beverages and supplements prepared from mangosteen fruit are claimed to support gut health and immunity, despite the absence of supporting evidence from clinical trials. we recently reported that alpha-mangostin (alpha-mg), the most abundant xanthone in mangosteen fruit, altered the intestinal microbiome, promoted dysbiosis, and exacerbated colitis in c57bl/6j mice. the objective of this study  was to determine whether induction of dysbiosis by dietary alpha-mg is limited to the c57bl/6j strain or represents a more generic response to chronic intake of the xanthone on the gut microbiota of mice. c3h, balb/c, nude foxn1nu, and c57bl/6j mice, each demonstrating unique microbiomes, were fed standard diet or diet containing 0.1% alpha-mg for four weeks. dietary alpha-mg significantly altered the cecal and colonic microbiota in all four strains of mice, promoting a reduction in generally assumed beneficial bacterial groups while increasing the abundance of pathogenic bacteria. consumption of alpha-mg was associated with reduced abundance of firmicutes and increased abundance of proteobacteria. the abundance of lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and lactobacillaceae was reduced in alpha-mg-fed mice, while that of enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae was increased. dietary alpha-mg also was associated with increased proliferation of colonic epithelial cells, infiltration of immune cells, infiltration of immune cells and increased fluid content in stool. these results suggest that ingestion  of pharmacologic doses of xanthones in mangosteen-containing supplements may adversely alter the gut microbiota and should be used with caution.

TI  == methanogenic food web in the gut contents of methane-emitting earthworm eudrilus  eugeniae from brazil.
AB  == the anoxic saccharide-rich conditions of the earthworm gut provide an ideal transient habitat for ingested microbes capable of anaerobiosis. it was recently  discovered that the earthworm eudrilus eugeniae from brazil can emit methane (ch4) and that ingested methanogens might be associated with this emission. the objective of this study was to resolve trophic interactions of bacteria and methanogens in the methanogenic food web in the gut contents of e. eugeniae. rna-based stable isotope probing of bacterial 16s rrna as well as mcra and mrta (the alpha subunit of methyl-com reductase and its isoenzyme, respectively) of methanogens was performed with [13c]-glucose as a model saccharide in the gut contents. concomitant fermentations were augmented by the rapid consumption of glucose, yielding numerous products, including molecular hydrogen (h2), carbon dioxide (co2), formate, acetate, ethanol, lactate, succinate and propionate. aeromonadaceae-affiliated facultative aerobes, and obligate anaerobes affiliated  to lachnospiraceae, veillonellaceae and ruminococcaceae were associated with the  diverse fermentations. methanogenesis was ongoing during incubations, and 13c-labeling of ch4 verified that supplemental [13c]-glucose derived carbon was dissimilated to ch4. hydrogenotrophic methanogens affiliated with methanobacteriaceae and methanoregulaceae were linked to methanogenesis, and acetogens related to peptostreptoccocaceae were likewise found to be participants in the methanogenic food web. h2 rather than acetate stimulated methanogenesis in the methanogenic gut content enrichments, and acetogens appeared to dissimilate supplemental h2 to acetate in methanogenic enrichments. these findings provide insight on the processes and associated taxa potentially linked to methanogenesis and the turnover of organic carbon in the alimentary canal of methane-emitting e. eugeniae.the isme journal advance online publication, 23 january 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2014.262.

TI  == effect of oral administration of metronidazole or prednisolone on fecal microbiota in dogs.
AB  == gastrointestinal microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various gastrointestinal disorders in dogs, including acute diarrhea and chronic enteropathy. metronidazole and prednisolone are commonly prescribed for the treatment of these diseases; however, their effects on gastrointestinal microbiota have not been investigated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs. metronidazole was administered twice daily at 12.5 mg/kg to a group of five healthy dogs, and prednisolone at 1.0 mg/kg daily to a second group of five healthy dogs for 14 days. fecal samples were collected before and after administration (day 0 and 14), and 14 and 28 days after cessation (day 28 and 42). dna was extracted, and the bacterial diversity and composition of each sample were determined based on 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences using next-generation sequencing (illumina miseq). in the group administered metronidazole, bacterial diversity indices significantly decreased at day 14, and recovered after the cessation. principal coordinates analysis and hierarchical dendrogram construction based on unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices revealed that bacterial composition was also significantly altered by metronidazole at day 14 compared with the other time points. the proportions of bacteroidaceae, clostridiaceae, fusobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, turicibacteraceae, and veillonellaceae decreased, while bifidobacteriaceae, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcaceae, and streptococcaceae increased at day 14 and returned to their initial proportions by day 42. conversely, no effect of prednisolone was observed on either the bacterial diversity or composition. reducing pathogenic bacteria such as fusobacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium through the administration of metronidazole may be beneficial for promoting gastrointestinal health; however, further investigations into the effects on diseased dogs are needed.

TI  == the bacterial microbiota of stolotermes ruficeps (stolotermitidae), a phylogenetically basal termite endemic to new zealand.
AB  == stolotermes ruficeps is a widespread, primitive, lower termite occupying dead and decaying wood of many tree species in new zealand's temperate forests. we identified core bacterial taxa involved in gut processes through combined dna- and rna (cdna)-based pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s nucleotide sequence from  five s. ruficeps colonies. most family and many genus-level taxa were common to s. ruficeps colonies despite being sampled from different tree species. major taxa identified were spirochaetaceae, elusimicrobiaceae and porphyromonadaceae. others less well known in termite guts were synergistaceae, desulfobacteraceae, rhodocyclaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. synergistaceae, lachnospiraceae and spirochaetaceae were well represented in the rna data set, indicating a high-protein synthesis potential. using 130,800 sequences from nine  s. ruficeps dna and rna data sets, we estimated a high level of bacterial richness (4024 phylotypes at 3% genetic distance). very few abundant phylotypes were site-specific; almost all (95%) abundant phylotypes, representing 97% of data set sequences, were detected in at least two s. ruficeps colonies. this study of a little-researched phylogenetically basal termite identifies core bacteria taxa. these findings will extend inventories of termite gut microbiota and contribute to the understanding of the specificity of termite gut microbiota.

TI  == diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the diversity of the butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (go) supplementation as revealed by  molecular analysis of cloned 16s rrna genes. six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with go ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). ruminal contents were used for dna extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. a total bacterial clone  library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16s rrna gene cloned sequences using universal primers. the resulting plasmids selected by butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and go group, respectively. in libraries, clones were classified to the genus pseudobutyrivibrio, butyrivibrio and others within the family lachnospiraceae. additionally, some specific clones were observed in go group, being classified to the genus ruminococcus and others within the family ruminococcaceae. based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. b. proteoclasticus and ps. ruminis) in control and go groups, respectively. further clones identified as b. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and r. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and go groups, respectively. the majority of clones resembled ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and go group 2.91). our results indicated that the  butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.

TI  == metabolomics analysis identifies intestinal microbiota-derived biomarkers of colonization resistance in clindamycin-treated mice.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota protect the host against enteric pathogens  through a defense mechanism termed colonization resistance. antibiotics excreted  into the intestinal tract may disrupt colonization resistance and alter normal metabolic functions of the microbiota. we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that alterations in levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal specimens could provide useful biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment. methods: to assess in vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with oral vancomycin-resistant enterococcus or clostridium difficile spores at varying time points after treatment with the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin. for concurrent groups of antibiotic-treated mice, stool samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in the microbiota and using non-targeted metabolic profiling. to assess whether the findings were applicable to another antibiotic class that suppresses intestinal anaerobes, similar experiments were conducted with piperacillin/tazobactam. results: colonization resistance began to recover within 5 days and was intact by 12 days after clindamycin treatment, coinciding with the recovery bacteria from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, both part of the phylum firmicutes. clindamycin treatment caused marked changes in metabolites present in fecal specimens. of 484 compounds analyzed, 146 (30%) exhibited a significant increase or decrease in concentration during clindamycin  treatment followed by recovery to baseline that coincided with restoration of in  vivo colonization resistance. identified as potential biomarkers of colonization  resistance, these compounds included intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that increased (pentitols, gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites) or decreased (pentoses, dipeptides) with clindamycin treatment. piperacillin/tazobactam treatment caused similar alterations in the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolites. conclusions: recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. these metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.

TI  == microbiota and metabolome associated with immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan).
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the fecal microbiota, and the fecal and urinary metabolome of non progressor (np) and progressor (p) patients with immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan). three groups of volunteers were included in the study: (i)  sixteen igan np patients; (ii) sixteen igan p patients; and (iii) sixteen healthy control (hc) subjects, without known diseases. selective media were used to determine the main cultivable bacterial groups. bacterial tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna and 16s rrna was carried out to determine total and metabolically active bacteria, respectively. biochrom 30 series amino acid analyzer and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry/solid-phase microextraction (gc-ms/spme) analyses were mainly carried out for metabolomic analyses. as estimated by rarefaction, chao and shannon diversity index, the lowest microbial diversity was found in p patients. firmicutes increased in the fecal samples of np and, especially, p patients due to the higher percentages of  some genera/species of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, eubacteriaceae and streptococcaeae. with a few exceptions, species of clostridium, enterococcus and  lactobacillus genera were found at the highest levels in hc. bacteroidaceae, porphyromonadaceae, prevotellaceae and rikenellaceae families differed among np,  p and hc subjects. sutterellaceae and enterobacteriaceae species were almost the  highest in the fecal samples of np and/or p patients. compared to hc subjects, bifidobacterium species decreased in the fecal samples of np and p. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of metabolites (free amino acids and organic volatile compounds) from fecal and urinary samples markedly differentiated np and, especially, p patients.

TI  == microbiome data distinguish patients with clostridium difficile infection and non-c. difficile-associated diarrhea from healthy controls.
AB  == antibiotic usage is the most commonly cited risk factor for hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infections (cdi). the increased risk is due to disruption of the indigenous microbiome and a subsequent decrease in colonization resistance by the perturbed bacterial community; however, the specific changes in the microbiome that lead to increased risk are poorly understood. we developed statistical models that incorporated microbiome data with clinical and demographic data to better understand why individuals develop cdi. the 16s rrna genes were sequenced from the feces of 338 individuals, including cases, diarrheal controls, and nondiarrheal controls. we modeled cdi and diarrheal status using multiple clinical variables, including age, antibiotic use, antacid  use, and other known risk factors using logit regression. this base model was compared to models that incorporated microbiome data, using diversity metrics, community types, or specific bacterial populations, to identify characteristics of the microbiome associated with cdi susceptibility or resistance. the addition  of microbiome data significantly improved our ability to distinguish cdi status when comparing cases or diarrheal controls to nondiarrheal controls. however, only when we assigned samples to community types was it possible to differentiate cases from diarrheal controls. several bacterial species within the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, bacteroides, and porphyromonadaceae were largely absent in cases and highly associated with nondiarrheal controls. the improved discriminatory ability of our microbiome-based models confirms the theory that factors affecting the microbiome influence cdi. importance the gut microbiome, composed of the trillions of bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, is responsible for a number of critical functions within  the host. these include digestion, immune system stimulation, and colonization resistance. the microbiome's role in colonization resistance, which is the ability to prevent and limit pathogen colonization and growth, is key for protection against clostridium difficile infections. however, the bacteria that are important for colonization resistance have not yet been elucidated. using statistical modeling techniques and different representations of the microbiome,  we demonstrated that several community types and the loss of several bacterial populations, including bacteroides, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae, are associated with cdi. our results emphasize the importance of considering the microbiome in mediating colonization resistance and may also direct the design of future multispecies probiotic therapies.

TI  == towards molecular biomarkers for biogas production from lignocellulose-rich substrates.
AB  == biogas production from lignocellulose-rich agricultural residues is gaining increasingly importance in sustainable energy production. hydrolysis/acidogenesis (h/a) of lignocellulose as the initial rate-limiting step deserves particular optimization. a mixture of straw/hay was methanized applying two-phase digester systems with an initial h/a reactor and a one-stage system at different, meso- and thermophilic temperatures. h/a was intensified with increasing ph values and  increasing temperature. h/a fermenters, however, were prone to switch to methanogenic systems at these conditions. substrate turnover was accelerated in the bi-phasic process but did not reach the methanation efficiency of the single-stage digestion. there was no indication that two different cellulolytic inocula could establish in the given process. bacterial communities were analyzed applying conventional amplicon clone sequencing targeting the hypervariable 16s rrna gene region v6-v8 and by metagenome analyses applying direct dna pyrosequencing without a pcr step. corresponding results suggested that pcr did not introduce a bias but offered better phylogenetic resolution. certain clostridium iv and prevotella members were most abundant in the h/a system operated at 38 degrees c, certain clostridium iii and lachnospiraceae bacteria in the 45 degrees c, and certain clostridium iv and thermohydrogenium/thermoanaerobacterium members in the 55 degrees c h/a system. clostridium iii representatives, lachnospiraceae and thermotogae dominated in the thermophilic single-stage system, in which also a higher portion of known syntrophic acetate oxidizers was found. specific (rt-)qpcr systems were designed  and applied for the most significant and abundant populations to assess their activity in the different digestion systems. the rt-qpcr results agreed with the  dna based community profiles obtained at the different temperatures. up to 10(12) 16s rrna copies ml(-1) were determined in h/a fermenters with prevalence of rrna  of a ruminococcaceae subgroup. besides, thermohydrogenium/thermoanaerobacterium rrna prevailed at thermophilic and prevotellaceae rrna at mesophilic conditions.  the developed (rt)-qpcr systems can be used as biomarkers to optimize biogas production from straw/hay and possibly other lignocellulosic substrates.

TI  == impact of diet and individual variation on intestinal microbiota composition and  fermentation products in obese men.
AB  == there is growing interest in understanding how diet affects the intestinal microbiota, including its possible associations with systemic diseases such as metabolic syndrome. here we report a comprehensive and deep microbiota analysis of 14 obese males consuming fully controlled diets supplemented with resistant starch (rs) or non-starch polysaccharides (nsps) and a weight-loss (wl) diet. we  analyzed the composition, diversity and dynamics of the fecal microbiota on each  dietary regime by phylogenetic microarray and quantitative pcr (qpcr) analysis. in addition, we analyzed fecal short chain fatty acids (scfas) as a proxy of colonic fermentation, and indices of insulin sensitivity from blood samples. the  diet explained around 10% of the total variance in microbiota composition, which  was substantially less than the inter-individual variance. yet, each of the study diets induced clear and distinct changes in the microbiota. multiple ruminococcaceae phylotypes increased on the rs diet, whereas mostly lachnospiraceae phylotypes increased on the nsp diet. bifidobacteria decreased significantly on the wl diet. the rs diet decreased the diversity of the microbiota significantly. the total 16s ribosomal rna gene signal estimated by qpcr correlated positively with the three major scfas, while the amount of propionate specifically correlated with the bacteroidetes. the dietary responsiveness of the individual's microbiota varied substantially and associated inversely with its diversity, suggesting that individuals can be stratified into  responders and non-responders based on the features of their intestinal microbiota.

TI  == revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type ii diabetes. this guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16s rrna gene sequencing. consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. however, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. we undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3,184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the integrated microbial genome database. genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. the majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from  actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, spirochaetes, and thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. the established gene catalogue (3,055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the hmp (human microbiome project) consortium. a high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1%;  range, 3.2% to 39.4%), where the acetyl-coenzyme a (coa) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7% of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2%). diversity analysis for the acetyl-coa pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with bacteroidetes. importance microbiome research has revealed new, important roles of our gut microbiota for maintaining health, but an understanding of effects of specific microbial functions on the host is in its infancy, partly because in-depth functional microbial analyses are rare and publicly available databases are often incomplete/misannotated. in this study, we focused on production of butyrate, the main energy source for colonocytes, which  plays a critical role in health and disease. we have provided a complete database of genes from major known butyrate-producing pathways, using in-depth genomic analysis of publicly available genomes, filling an important gap to accurately assess the butyrate-producing potential of complex microbial communities from "-omics"-derived data. furthermore, a reference data set containing the abundance and diversity of butyrate synthesis pathways from the healthy gut microbiota was  established through a metagenomics-based assessment. this study will help in understanding the role of butyrate producers in health and disease and may assist the development of treatments for functional dysbiosis.

TI  == discordance between changes in the gut microbiota and pathogenicity in a mouse model of spontaneous colitis.
AB  == under conventional conditions, mice deficient in core 1-derived o-glycans (tm-iec c1galt1(-/-)), which have a defective mucus layer, experienced spontaneous inflammation of the colon. analysis of fecal bacterial populations by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene showed that disease in conventional tm-iec c1galt1(-/-) was associated with shifts in the microbiota manifested by increases in lactobacillus and clostridium species, and decreases in unclassified ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae. under germ-free (gf) conditions, tm-iec c1galt1(-/-) presented decreased goblet cells, but did not develop inflammation.  monoassociation of gf tm-iec c1galt1(-/-) revealed that bacterial species differ  significantly in their ability to induce inflammatory changes. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron caused inflammation, while lactobacillus johnsonii (enriched during colitis) did not. these observations demonstrate that not all microbiota shifts that correlate with disease contribute to pathogenesis.

AB  == it is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following clostridium perfringens infection. however, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. we analysed caecal microbiota  of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16s rdna amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed  and eimeria infected chicks. we found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of c. perfringens infection. we noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable lactobacillus counts remained stable. the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, unknown clostridiales and lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (otus) that had previously been linked to crohn's disease and reductions in otus known to be butyrate producers. eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown clostridium species were increased in abundance. additionally, eimeria did not significantly influence changes in ph, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. both fishmeal feeding and eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.

TI  == doenjang, a fermented korean soybean paste, inhibits lipopolysaccharide production of gut microbiota in mice.
AB  == doenjang has been reported to exhibit antioxidant, fibrinolytic, antimutagenic, anticancer, and antiobesity effects. in our preliminary study, doenjang decreased fecal lipopolysaccharide (lps) levels in mice. therefore, we investigated the effect of doenjang on the composition of gut microbiota in mice. treatment with doenjang significantly increased the number of bifidobacteria cultured in bl media, compared with mice not treated with doenjang. however, doenjang decreased  the number of enterobacteriaceae cultured in dhl media. doenjang significantly suppressed the beta-glucuronidase activity, but did not influence alpha-/beta-glucosaminidase and alpha-/beta-glucosidase activities. when gut microbiota in mice treated with or without doenjang was analyzed by pyrosequencing, doenjang induced a significant modulation of the populations of the dominant gut microbiota. at the phylum level, doenjang treatment resulted in  a significant decrease of firmicutes and an increase of bacteroidetes, which led  to a decrease in the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio in gut microbiota. at the  family level, the number of ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae were significantly decreased, while the number of odoribacter_f was increased in doenjang-treated mice. of colonic tight junction proteins, occludin, zo-1, and claudin-1 in mice, occludin alone was significantly increased by treatment with doenjang. although treatment with doenjang seemed to suppress nf-kappab activation, it was not significant. doenjang significantly suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression, whereas it did not influence interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6 expression. however, doenjang increased il-10 expression. based on these findings, doenjang may promote gut health by regulating gut microbiota and its lps concentrations and suppressing harmful enzyme production.

TI  == coprophagous behavior of rabbit pups affects implantation of cecal microbiota and health status.
AB  == during the first few weeks after delivery, female rabbits excrete fecal pellets,  which are ingested by their pups. we hypothesized that maternal excretion of hard fecal pellets and the coprophagous behavior of their pups were involved in cecal  microbiota implantation. four groups were compared: in 1 group (fm), pups had free access to maternal fecal pellets; in a second group, ingestion of feces was  prevented (nf); and in 2 additional groups, pups had access only to fecal pellets excreted by foreign females receiving either no antibiotic (ff) or tiamulin and tetracycline (ffab). a total of 109 litters in 3 batches were used to quantify excretion and ingestion of feces and mortality. bacterial composition was assessed by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 to v4 region of 16s rna genes and fermentative measurements in 128 rabbits of 1 batch at age 14, 35, 49, and 80 d with 8 rabbits per group for each age with 2 rabbits per litter. the number of fecal pellets excreted by does from 2 to 20 d after delivery ranged widely, but was similar among groups (16.1 +/- 12.6 fecal pellets/doe). the excretion peaked  during the first 6 d after delivery. foreign fecal ingestion (ff and ffab groups) was 3 times greater (p < 0.001) than ingestion of maternal feces (9.9 +/- 7.8). ingestion of feces in the ff group was greater than in the ffab groups (35.6 +/-  9.3 vs. 29.5 +/- 9.7; p < 0.05). compared with the fm group, ingestion of feces in the ff and ffab groups began later (6 to 7 d vs. 2 to 3 d after birth) and peaked at 14 to 17 d (4.0 +/- 1.8 hard fecal pellets.litter(-1) . d(-1)) and 13 to 15 d (3.5 +/- 1.7 hard fecal pellets litter(-1) d(-1)), respectively. during the 36 to 49 d period, the ff and nf groups exhibited the least (2.8%) and greatest (9.5%) mortality, respectively (p = 0.03). at age 14 d, the cecal bacterial community was dominated by bacteroidetes phyla (63.3 +/- 15.1%), bacteroidaceae family (36.0 +/- 18.8%), and bacteriodes genus (36.0 +/- 2.3%). with increasing age, firmicutes phyla, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae families became the dominant taxa (92.0 +/- 4.7, 44.0 +/- 13.7, 37.9 +/- 11.6% at age 80 d, respectively). impairment of fecal ingestion delayed this ecological succession, with greater and lower relative abundance of bacteroidaceae and ruminococcaceae, respectively, than in the other 3 groups at age 35 d (p < 0.10). in conclusion, although excretion of hard fecal pellets by does ranged widely, the coprophagous behavior of their pups affected the implantation of cecal bacterial microbiota.

TI  == investigation of bacterial diversity in the feces of cattle fed different diets.
AB  == the objective of this study is to investigate individual animal variation of bovine fecal microbiota including as affected by diets. fecal samples were collected from 426 cattle fed 1 of 3 diets typically fed to feedlot cattle: 1) 143 steers fed finishing diet (83% dry-rolled corn, 13% corn silage, and 4% supplement), 2) 147 steers fed late growing diet (66% dry-rolled corn, 26% corn silage, and 8% supplement), and 3) 136 heifers fed early growing diet (70% corn silage and 30% alfalfa haylage). bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were determined from individual fecal samples using next-generation pyrosequencing technology. a total of 2,149,008 16s rrna gene sequences from 333 cattle with at  least 2,000 sequences were analyzed. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were dominant phyla in all fecal samples. at the genus level, oscillibacter, turicibacter, roseburia, fecalibacterium, coprococcus, clostridium, prevotella, and succinivibrio were represented by more than 1% of total sequences. however, numerous sequences could not be assigned to a known genus. dominant unclassified  groups were unclassified ruminococcaceae and unclassified lachnospiraceae that could be classified to a family but not to a genus. these dominant genera and unclassified groups differed (p < 0.001) with diets. a total of 176,692 operational taxonomic units (otu) were identified in combination across all the 333 cattle. only 2,359 otu were shared across 3 diet groups. unifrac analysis showed that bacterial communities in cattle feces were greatly affected by dietary differences. this study indicates that the community structure of fecal microbiota in cattle is greatly affected by diet, particularly between forage- and concentrate-based diets.

TI  == microbiota dynamics in patients treated with fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembraneous colitis and is responsible for a large and increasing fraction of hospital-acquired infections. fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is an alternate treatment option for recurrent c. difficile infection (rcdi) refractory to antibiotic therapy. it has recently been discussed favorably in the clinical and scientific communities and is receiving increasing public attention. however, short- and long-term health consequences of fmt remain a concern, as the effects  of the transplanted microbiota on the patient remain unknown. to shed light on microbial events associated with rcdi and treatment by fmt, we performed fecal microbiota analysis by 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing of 14 pairs of healthy donors and rcdi patients treated successfully by fmt. post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples collected up to one year after fmt were studied longitudinally, including one post-fmt patient with antibiotic-associated relapse three months after fmt. this analysis allowed us not only to confirm prior reports that rcdi is associated with reduced diversity and compositional changes  in the fecal microbiota, but also to characterize previously undocumented post-fmt microbiota dynamics. members of the streptococcaceae, enterococcaceae, or enterobacteriaceae were significantly increased and putative butyrate producers, such as lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were significantly reduced in samples from rcdi patients before fmt as compared to post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples. rcdi patient samples showed more case-specific variations  than post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples. however, none of the bacterial groups were invariably associated with rcdi or successful treatment by fmt. overall microbiota compositions in post-fmt patients, specifically abundances of  the above-mentioned firmicutes, continued to change for at least 16 weeks after fmt, suggesting that full microbiota recovery from rcdi may take much longer than expected based on the disappearance of diarrheal symptoms immediately after fmt.

TI  == newly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous  culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides.
AB  == one of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. in ruminant animals, the majority of  their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can  be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. a total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16s rrna gene sequencing. six phyla were represented: firmicutes (51.9%), bacteroidetes (30.9%), proteobacteria (11.1%), actinobacteria (3.5%), synergistetes (1.5%), and fusobacteria (1.1%). the majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with  sequences in the ribosomal database project and thus represent new species and/or genera. within the firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and clostridiaceae i. the  majority of the bacteroidetes were most closely related to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, and b. xylanisolvens and members of the porphyromonadaceae family. many of the firmicutes and bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall  components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. the microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. with over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured,  there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.

TI  == association of dietary type with fecal microbiota in vegetarians and omnivores in slovenia.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to discover differences in the human fecal microbiota composition driven by long-term omnivore versus vegan/lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern. in addition, the possible association of demographic characteristics and dietary habits such as consumption of particular foods with the fecal microbiota was examined. methods: this study was conducted on a slovenian population comprising 31 vegetarian participants (11 lacto-vegetarians  and 20 vegans) and 29 omnivore participants. bacterial dna was extracted from the frozen fecal samples by maxwell 16 tissue dna purification kit (promega). relative quantification of selected bacterial groups was performed by real-time pcr. differences in fecal microbiota composition were evaluated by pcr-dgge fingerprinting of the v3 16s rrna region. participants' demographic characteristics, dietary habits and health status information were collected through a questionnaire. results: vegetarian diet was associated with higher ratio (% of group-specific dna in relation to all bacterial dna) of bacteroides-prevotella, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium clostridioforme and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but with lower ratio (%) of clostridium cluster xiva. real-time pcr also showed a higher concentration and ratio of enterobacteriaceae (16s rdna copies/g and %) in female participants (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and decrease in bifidobacterium with age (p < 0.01). dgge analysis of the 16s rrna v3 region showed that relative quantity of dgge bands from certain bacterial groups was lower (bifidobacterium, streptococus, collinsella and lachnospiraceae) or higher (subdoligranulum) among vegetarians, indicating the association of dietary type with bacterial community composition. sequencing of selected dgge bands revealed the presence of common representatives of fecal microbiota: bacteroides, eubacterium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcaceae, bifidobacterium and lachnospiraceae. up to 4 % of variance in microbial community analyzed by dgge could be explained by the vegetarian type of diet. conclusions:  long-term vegetarian diet contributed to quantity and associated bacterial community shifts in fecal microbiota composition. consumption of foods of animal  origin (eggs, red meat, white meat, milk, yoghurt, other dairy products, fish and seafood) and vegetarian type of diet explained the largest share of variance in microbial community structure. fecal microbiota composition was also associated with participants' age, gender and body mass.

TI  == fecal protease activity is associated with compositional alterations in the intestinal microbiota.
AB  == objective: intestinal proteases carry out a variety of functions in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. studies have reported that elevated enteric proteases in patients with gi disease can alter intestinal physiology, however the origin (human vs. microbial) of elevated proteases in patients with gi disease is unclear. aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the association between protease activity and the microbiota in human fecal samples. design: in order to capture a wide range of fecal protease (fp) activity stool samples were  collected from 30 ibs patients and 24 healthy controls. the intestinal microbiota was characterized using 454 high throughput pyro-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the composition and diversity of microbial communities were determined and compared using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (qiime) pipeline. fp activity levels were determined using an elisa-based method. fp activity was ranked and top and bottom quartiles (n=13 per quartile) were identified as having high and low fp activity, respectively. results: the overall diversity of the intestinal microbiota displayed significant clustering separation (p = 0.001) between samples with high vs. low fp activity. the lactobacillales, lachnospiraceae, and streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with fp activity across the entire study population, whilst the ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fp activity. conclusions: these data demonstrate significant associations between specific intestinal bacterial groups and fecal protease activity and provide a basis for further causative studies investigating the role of enteric microbes and gi diseases.

TI  == high-fat diet alters gut microbiota physiology in mice.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota is known to regulate host energy homeostasis and can be influenced by high-calorie diets. however, changes affecting the ecosystem at the functional level are still not well characterized. we measured shifts in cecal bacterial communities in mice fed a carbohydrate or high-fat (hf) diet for 12 weeks at the level of the following: (i) diversity and taxa distribution by high-throughput 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing; (ii) bulk and single-cell chemical composition by fourier-transform infrared- (ft-ir) and raman micro-spectroscopy and (iii) metaproteome and metabolome via high-resolution mass spectrometry. high-fat diet caused shifts in the diversity of dominant gut bacteria and altered the proportion of ruminococcaceae (decrease) and rikenellaceae (increase). ft-ir spectroscopy revealed that the impact of the diet on cecal chemical fingerprints is greater than the impact of microbiota composition. diet-driven changes in biochemical fingerprints of members of the bacteroidales and lachnospiraceae were also observed at the level of single cells, indicating that there were distinct differences in cellular composition of dominant phylotypes under different diets. metaproteome and metabolome analyses based on the occurrence of 1760 bacterial proteins and 86 annotated metabolites revealed distinct hf diet-specific profiles. alteration of hormonal and anti-microbial networks, bile acid and bilirubin metabolism and shifts towards amino acid and simple sugars metabolism were observed. we conclude that a hf diet markedly affects the gut bacterial ecosystem at the functional level.

TI  == infection with the carcinogenic liver fluke opisthorchis viverrini modifies intestinal and biliary microbiome.
AB  == opisthorchis viverrini is a fish-borne trematode endemic in east asia. following  ingestion, the flukes locate to the biliary tre where chronic infection frequently leads to cholangiocarcinoma (cca). the mechanisms by which o. viverrini infection culminates in cca remain unknown. an unexplored aspect is its influence on the host microbiome. in the hamster, infection with this pathogen reliably leads to cca. genomic dnas of microbiota from colorectal contents and bile of hamsters and from whole o. viverrini were examined in this model of fluke-induced cca. microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of variable regions 7-9 of prokaryotic 16s ribosomal dna. of approximately 1 million sequences, 536,009 with useable reads were assignable to  29,776 operational taxonomy units (otus) and, in turn, to 20 phyla and 273 genera of bacteria or archaea. microbial community analyses revealed that fluke infection perturbed the gastrointestinal tract microbiome, increasing lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and lactobacillaceae, while decreasing porphyromonadaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and eubacteriaceae (p</=0.05). more than 60 otus were detected in the biliary system, which confirmed bacteriobilia and a  noteworthy community of microbes associated with the parasites. the fluke-associated microorganisms included potential pathogens from the enterobacteriaceae and listeriaceae and others, including cyanobacteria and deinococci, usually found in external environments. given that opisthorchiasis is distinguished from other helminth infections by a robust inflammatory phenotype with conspicuously elevated il-6, and that inflammation of the biliary system leads to periductal fibrosis, which is a precursor of cca, the flukes and their microbiota may together drive this distinctive immune response.

TI  == the microbial community in the feces of the white rhinoceros (ceratotherium simum) as determined by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis.
AB  == as a non-ruminant herbivore, the white rhinoceros has the ability to utilize fibrous plant matter through microbial fermentation in the hindgut. so far, there has been no report using molecular techniques to study the gut microbiota of the  white rhinoceros. we used barcoded pyrosequencing to characterize 105,651 sequences of 16s rrna genes obtained from fecal samples from five white rhinoceroses. results showed that firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla in the samples, which were comprised largely of unclassified bacteria. the microbiota of one animal treated with drug therapy differed from those in other healthy animals, and was dominated by aerococcus -related bacteria. the core microbiota in the healthy rhinoceros were dominated by phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, represented by the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, rikenellaceae and prevotellaceae families. the present work provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the complex microbial community of the rhinoceros; however, further studies are required to link the distinctive microbiota with their digestive role in the hindgut of the white rhinoceros.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == influence of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection on the composition of chicken cecal microbiota.
AB  == background: infection of newly hatched chicks with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis) results in an inflammatory response in the intestinal tract which may influence the composition of gut microbiota. in this study we were therefore interested whether s. enteritidis induced inflammation results in changes in the cecal microbiota. to reach this aim, we compared the cecal microbiota of non-infected chickens and those infected by s. enteritidis by pyrosequencing the v3/v4 variable regions of genes coding for 16s rrna. results:  cecal microbiota of chickens up to 19 days of life was dominated by representatives of enterobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, followed by lactobacillaceae. the presence of lachnospiraceae did not change after s. enteritidis infection. enterobacteriaceae increased and ruminococcaceae  decreased after s. enteritidis infection in two independent experiments although  these results were not significant. a significant increase in both experiments was observed only for the representatives of lactobacillaceae which may correlate with their microaerophilic growth characteristic compared to the obligate anaerobes from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. conclusions: we  conclude that s. enteritidis infection influences the composition of the cecal microbiota in chickens but these changes are minor in nature and should be understood more as an indirect consequence of infection and inflammation rather than a positively selected evolutionary trait.

TI  == modulation of post-antibiotic bacterial community reassembly and host response by candida albicans.
AB  == the introduction of candida albicans into cefoperazone-treated mice results in changes in bacterial community reassembly. our objective was to use high-throughput sequencing to characterize at much greater depth the specific changes in the bacterial microbiome. the colonization of c. albicans significantly altered bacterial community reassembly that was evident at multiple taxonomic levels of resolution. there were marked changes in the levels of bacteriodetes and lactobacillaceae. lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, the two  most abundant bacterial families, did not change in relative proportions after antibiotics, but there were marked genera-level shifts within these two bacterial families. the microbiome shifts occurred in the absence of overt intestinal inflammation. overall, these experiments demonstrate that the introduction of a single new microbe in numerically inferior numbers into the bacterial microbiome  during a broad community disturbance has the potential to significantly alter the subsequent reassembly of the bacterial community as it recovers from that disturbance.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and depletion of butyrogenic bacteria in clostridium difficile infection and nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nearly half a million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the united states each year. although the importance of the gut microbiota in c. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. culture-independent high-density roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the  distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with cdi, 36 subjects with c. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (cdn), and 40 healthy control subjects. a  total of 526,071 partial 16s rrna sequence reads of the v1 to v3 regions were aligned with 16s databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the cdi and cdn groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the firmicutes phylum. normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing c2 to c4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in  the cdi and cdn groups. these data demonstrate associations between the depletion of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including c. difficile infection. mechanistic studies focusing on the functional roles of these organisms in diarrheal diseases and resistance against c. difficile colonization are warranted.

AB  == the rebirth of bacterial culture has been highlighted successively by environmental microbiologists, the design of axenic culture for intracellular bacteria in clinical microbiology, and, more recently, by human gut microbiota studies. indeed, microbial culturomics (large scale of culture conditions with the identification of colonies by maldi-tof or 16s rrna) allowed to culture 32 new bacterial species from only four stool samples studied. we performed culturomics in comparison with pyrosequencing 16s rrna targeting the v6 region on an anorexia nervosa stool sample because this clinical condition has never been explored before by culture, while its composition has been observed to be atypical by metagenomics. we tested 88 culture conditions generating 12,700 different colonies identifying 133 bacterial species, with 19 bacterial species never isolated from the human gut before, including 11 new bacterial species for  which the genome has been sequenced. these 11 new bacterial species isolated from a single stool sample allow to extend more significantly the repertoire in comparison to the bacterial species validated by the rest of the world during the last 2 years. pyrosequencing indicated a dramatic discrepancy with the culturomics results, with only 23 otus assigned to the species level overlapping  (17 % of the culturomics results). most of the sequences assigned to bacteria detected only by pyrosequencing belonged to ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and erysipelotrichaceae constituted by strictly anaerobic species, indicating the future route for culturomics. this study revealed new bacterial species participating significantly to the extension of the gut microbiota repertoire, which is the first step before being able to connect the bacterial composition with the geographic or clinical status.

TI  == a microbial signature approach to identify fecal pollution in the waters off an urbanized coast of lake michigan.
AB  == urban coasts receive watershed drainage from ecosystems that include highly developed lands with sewer and stormwater infrastructure. in these complex ecosystems, coastal waters are often contaminated with fecal pollution, where multiple delivery mechanisms that often contain multiple fecal sources make it difficult to mitigate the pollution. here, we exploit bacterial community sequencing of the v6 and v6v4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene to identify bacterial distributions that signal the presence of sewer, fecal, and human fecal pollution. the sequences classified to three sewer infrastructure-associated bacterial genera, acinetobacter, arcobacter, and trichococcus, and five fecal-associated bacterial families, bacteroidaceae, porphyromonadaceae, clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae, served  as signatures of sewer and fecal contamination, respectively. the human fecal signature was determined with the bayesian source estimation program sourcetracker, which we applied to a set of 40 sewage influent samples collected  in milwaukee, wi, usa to identify operational taxonomic units (>/= 97 % identity) that were most likely of human fecal origin. during periods of dry weather, the magnitudes of all three signatures were relatively low in milwaukee's urban rivers and harbor and nearly zero in lake michigan. however, the relative contribution of the sewer and fecal signature frequently increased to > 2 % of the measured surface water communities following sewer overflows. also during combined sewer overflows, the ratio of the human fecal pollution signature to the fecal pollution signature in surface waters was generally close to that of sewage, but this ratio decreased dramatically during dry weather and rain events, suggesting that nonhuman fecal pollution was the dominant source during these weather-driven scenarios. the qpcr detection of two human fecal indicators, human bacteroides and lachno2, confirmed the urban fecal footprint in this ecosystem extends to at least 8 km offshore.

AB  == the ruminal microbiome of cattle plays an important role not only in animal health and productivity but also in food safety and environment. microbial profiles of rumen fluid obtained from dairy cows fed on three different fiber/starch diet compositions were characterized. tagged 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and statistical analysis revealed that the dominant ruminal bacteria shared by all three sample groups belonged to phyla bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. however, the relative abundance of these bacterial groups was markedly affected by diet composition. in animals fed with a high fiber diet, the fibrolytic and cellulolytic bacteria lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and fibrobacteraceae were found in highest abundance compared with animals fed other diets with lower fiber content. the polysaccharide-degrading prevotellaceae and flavobacteriaceae bacteria were most  abundant in the rumen of cows fed on diet with the highest starch content. these  data highlight the ruminal microbiome's ability to adapt to feed composition and  also provide a basis for the development of feed formulation systems designed to  improve livestock productivity.

AB  == background & aims: the histopathology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is similar to that of alcoholic liver disease. colonic bacteria are a source of many metabolic products, including ethanol and other volatile organic compounds (voc) that may have toxic effects on the human host after intestinal absorption and delivery to the liver via the portal vein. recent data suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota in obese human beings is different from that of healthy-weight individuals. the aim of this study was to compare the colonic microbiome and voc metabolome of obese nafld patients (n = 30) with healthy controls (n = 30). methods: multitag pyrosequencing was used to characterize the  fecal microbiota. fecal voc profiles were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. results: there were statistically significant differences in liver  biochemistry and metabolic parameters in nafld. deep sequencing of the fecal microbiome revealed over-representation of lactobacillus species and selected members of phylum firmicutes (lachnospiraceae; genera, dorea, robinsoniella, and  roseburia) in nafld patients, which was statistically significant. one member of  phylum firmicutes was under-represented significantly in the fecal microbiome of  nafld patients (ruminococcaceae; genus, oscillibacter). fecal voc profiles of the 2 patient groups were different, with a significant increase in fecal ester compounds observed in nafld patients. conclusions: a significant increase in fecal ester voc is associated with compositional shifts in the microbiome of obese nafld patients. these novel bacterial metabolomic and metagenomic factors are implicated in the etiology and complications of obesity.

TI  == sewage reflects the distribution of human faecal lachnospiraceae.
AB  == faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional  enterococci and escherichia coli faecal indicators. we used massively parallel sequencing (mps) of the 16s rrna gene to characterize microbial communities from  wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the usa. we examined members of the clostridiales, which included the families clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. clone libraries targeting clostridium coccoides (c. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that lachnospiraceae-annotated v6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported c. coccoides group. we used oligotyping to profile the genus  blautia within lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. these findings suggest that  indicators based on blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

TI  == the impact of environmental heterogeneity and life stage on the hindgut microbiota of holotrichia parallela larvae (coleoptera: scarabaeidae).
AB  == gut microbiota has diverse ecological and evolutionary effects on its hosts. however, the ways in which it responds to environmental heterogeneity and host physiology remain poorly understood. to this end, we surveyed intestinal microbiota of holotrichia parallela larvae at different instars and from different geographic regions. bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed and clones were subsequently screened by dgge and sequenced. firmicutes and proteobacteria were the major phyla, and bacteria belonging to ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, enterobacteriaceae, desulfovibrionaceae and rhodocyclaceae families were commonly found in all natural populations. however,  bacterial diversity (chao1 and shannon indices) and community structure varied across host populations, and the observed variation can be explained by soil ph,  organic carbon and total nitrogen, and the climate factors (e.g., mean annual temperature) of the locations where the populations were sampled. furthermore, increases in the species richness and diversity of gut microbiota were observed during larval growth. bacteroidetes comprised the dominant group in the first instar; however, firmicutes composed the majority of the hindgut microbiota during the second and third instars. our results suggest that the gut's bacterial community changes in response to environmental heterogeneity and host's physiology, possibly to meet the host's ecological needs or physiological demands.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.
AB  == fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is becoming a more widely used technology  for treatment of recurrent clostridum difficile infection (cdi). while previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for fmt, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat cdi. here we report that high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following fmt using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. post fmt samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. proteobacteria and actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to fmt. post fmt samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of  members of the families bacteroidaceae, rikenellaceae and porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of bacteroides, alistipes and parabacteroides genera. members of the phylum firmicutes were represented by ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified clostridiales and members of the firmicutes. one patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal proteobacteria, primarily enterobacteriaceae. our results demonstrate that frozen fecal microbiota from a healthy donor can be used to effectively treat recurrent cdi resulting in restoration of the structure of gut microbiota and clearing of clostridum difficile.

TI  == the nonfermentable dietary fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose modulates intestinal microbiota.
AB  == diet influences host metabolism and intestinal microbiota; however, detailed understanding of this tripartite interaction is limited. to determine whether the nonfermentable fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) could alter the intestinal microbiota and whether such changes correlated with metabolic improvements, c57b/l6 mice were normalized to a high-fat diet (hfd), then either  maintained on hfd (control), or switched to hfd supplemented with 10% hpmc, or a  low-fat diet (lfd). compared to control treatment, both lfd and hpmc reduced weight gain (11.8 and 5.7 g, respectively), plasma cholesterol (23.1 and 19.6%),  and liver triglycerides (73.1 and 44.6%), and, as revealed by 454-pyrosequencing  of the microbial 16s rrna gene, decreased microbial alpha-diversity and differentially altered intestinal microbiota. both lfd and hpmc increased intestinal erysipelotrichaceae (7.3- and 12.4-fold) and decreased lachnospiraceae (2.0- and 2.7-fold), while only hpmc increased peptostreptococcaceae (3.4-fold) and decreased ruminococcaceae (2.7-fold). specific microorganisms were directly linked with weight change and metabolic parameters in hpmc and hfd mice, but not  in lfd mice, indicating that the intestinal microbiota may play differing roles during the two dietary modulations. this work indicates that hpmc is a potential  prebiotic fiber that influences intestinal microbiota and improves host metabolism.

TI  == microbial ecology of the rumen evaluated by 454 gs flx pyrosequencing is affected by starch and oil supplementation of diets.
AB  == to provide a comprehensive examination of the bacterial diversity in the rumen content of cows fed different diets, high-throughput 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing was used. four rumen fistulated nonlactating holstein cows received 12 kg of dry matter per day of four diets based on maize silage during four periods: the low-starch diet (22% starch, 3% fat); the high-starch diet, supplemented with wheat plus barley (35% starch, 3% fat); the low-starch plus oil diet, supplemented with 5% of sunflower oil (20% starch, 7.6% fat) and the high-starch plus oil diet (33% starch, 7.3% fat). samples were taken after 12 days of adaptation, 5 h postfeeding. whatever the diet, bacterial community of sieved rumen contents was dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, prevotellaceae, and rikenellaceae families were highly present and were clearly affected by cow diet. the highest abundance of prevotellaceae and the lowest abundance of ruminococcaceae and rikenellaceae were found with the high-starch plus oil diet. dietary starch increased the relative abundance of only three genera: barnesiella, oribacterium and olsenella, but decreased the relative abundances of several genera, with very significant effects for rikenellaceae_rc9 and butyrivibrio-pseudobutyrivibrio. oil alone had  a limited effect, but interestingly, starch plus oil addition differently affected the bacterial populations compared to starch addition without oil.

TI  == the gut microbiome of kittens is affected by dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio and associated with blood metabolite and hormone concentrations.
AB  == high-protein, low-carbohydrate (hplc) diets are common in cats, but their effect  on the gut microbiome has been ignored. the present study was conducted to test the effects of dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio on the gut microbiota of growing kittens. male domestic shorthair kittens were raised by mothers fed moderate-protein, moderate-carbohydrate (mpmc; n 7) or hplc (n 7) diets, and then weaned at 8 weeks onto the same diet. fresh faeces were collected at 8, 12 and 16 weeks; dna was extracted, followed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s rrna gene using 454 pyrosequencing. a total of 384 588 sequences (average of  9374 per sample) were generated. dual hierarchical clustering indicated distinct  clustering based on the protein:carbohydrate ratio regardless of age. the protein:carbohydrate ratio affected faecal bacteria. faecal actinobacteria were greater (p< 0.05) and fusobacteria were lower (p< 0.05) in mpmc-fed kittens. faecal clostridium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcus, blautia and eubacterium were  greater (p< 0.05) in hplc-fed kittens, while dialister, acidaminococcus, bifidobacterium, megasphaera and mitsuokella were greater (p< 0.05) in mpmc-fed kittens. principal component analysis of faecal bacteria and blood metabolites and hormones resulted in distinct clusters. of particular interest was the clustering of blood tag with faecal clostridiaceae, eubacteriaceae, ruminococcaceae, fusobacteriaceae and lachnospiraceae; blood ghrelin with faecal  coriobacteriaceae, bifidobacteriaceae and veillonellaceae; and blood glucose, cholesterol and leptin with faecal lactobacillaceae. the present results demonstrate that the protein:carbohydrate ratio affects the faecal microbiome, and highlight the associations between faecal microbes and circulating hormones and metabolites that may be important in terms of satiety and host metabolism.

TI  == phylotype-level 16s rrna analysis reveals new bacterial indicators of health state in acute murine colitis.
AB  == human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis models in mice are associated with shifts in intestinal microbiota composition, but it is unclear at what taxonomic/phylogenetic level such microbiota dynamics can be indicative for  health or disease. here, we report that dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis is accompanied by major shifts in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota of stat1(-/-) and wild-type mice, as determined by 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s rrna (gene) amplicons, metatranscriptomics and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of selected phylotypes. the bacterial families ruminococcaceae, bacteroidaceae, enterobacteriaceae, deferribacteraceae and verrucomicrobiaceae increased in relative abundance in dss-treated mice. comparative 16s rrna sequence analysis at maximum possible phylogenetic resolution identified several indicator phylotypes for dss treatment, including the putative mucin degraders akkermansia and mucispirillum.  the analysis additionally revealed strongly contrasting abundance changes among phylotypes of the same family, particularly within the lachnospiraceae. these extensive phylotype-level dynamics were hidden when reads were grouped at higher  taxonomic levels. metatranscriptomic analysis provided insights into functional shifts in the murine intestinal microbiota, with increased transcription of genes associated with regulation and cell signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and respiration and decreased transcription of flagellin genes during inflammation. these findings (i) establish the first in-depth inventory of the mouse gut microbiota and its metatranscriptome in the dss colitis model, (ii) reveal that family-level microbial community analyses are insufficient to reveal important colitis-associated microbiota shifts and (iii) support a scenario of shifting intra-family structure and function in the phylotype-rich and phylogenetically diverse lachnospiraceae in dss-treated mice.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of the bacterial content of stool from patients with chronic pouchitis, normal pouches, or familial adenomatous polyposis pouches.
AB  == background: chronic pouchitis is an important long-term complication following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. antibiotic administration reduces symptoms of pouchitis, indicating that bacteria have a role in pathogenesis. the aim of the research was to investigate the bacterial content of pouches using nucleic acid-based methods. methods: stool microbiota of 17 patients with normal pouches (np), 17 patients with pouchitis (cp) utilizing samples collected from each patient when antibiotic-treated (cp-on, asymptomatic) and when untreated (cp-off, symptomatic), and 14 familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) patients were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, fluorescence in situ  hybridization technologies, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results: fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed an expanded phylogenetic gap in np and cp-off patients relative to fap. antibiotic treatment  reduced the gap in cp stool. the phylogenetic gap of cp-off patients was due to members of the bacterial families caulobacteriaceae, sphingomonadaceae, comamonadaceae, peptostreptococcaceae, and clostridiaceae. there was a greater diversity of phylotypes of clostridiaceae in cp-off subjects. the phylogenetic gap of np stool was enriched by ruminococcaceae and bifidobacteriaceae. cp stool  microbiota had reduced diversity relative to np and fap stool due largely to a reduction in lachnospiraceae/insertae sedis xiv/clostridial cluster iv groups. conclusions: bacterial groups within the expanded phylogenetic gap of pouch patients may have roles in the pathogenesis of pouchitis. further research concerning the physiology of cultured members of these groups will be necessary to explain their specific roles. members of the lachnospiraceae, incertae sedis xiv, and clostridial cluster iv could be useful biomarkers of pouch health.

TI  == linkage of gut microbiome with cognition in hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == hepatic encephalopathy (he) has been related to gut bacteria and inflammation in  the setting of intestinal barrier dysfunction. we aimed to link the gut microbiome with cognition and inflammation in he using a systems biology approach. multitag pyrosequencing (mtps) was performed on stool of cirrhotics and age-matched controls. cirrhotics with/without he underwent cognitive testing, inflammatory cytokines, and endotoxin analysis. patients with he were compared with those without he using a correlation-network analysis. a select group of patients with he (n = 7) on lactulose underwent stool mtps before and after lactulose withdrawal over 14 days. twenty-five patients [17 he (all on lactulose, 6 also on rifaximin) and 8 without he, age 56 +/- 6 yr, model for end-stage liver disease score 16 +/- 6] and ten controls were included. fecal microbiota in cirrhotics were significantly different (higher enterobacteriaceae, alcaligeneceae, and fusobacteriaceae and lower ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae) compared with controls. we found altered flora (higher veillonellaceae), poor cognition, endotoxemia, and inflammation (il-6, tnf-alpha, il-2, and il-13) in he compared with cirrhotics without he. in the cirrhosis group, alcaligeneceae and porphyromonadaceae were positively correlated with cognitive impairment. fusobacteriaceae, veillonellaceae, and enterobacteriaceae were positively and ruminococcaceae negatively related to inflammation. network-analysis comparison showed robust correlations (all p < 1e-5) only in the he group between the microbiome, cognition, and il-23, il-2, and il-13. lactulose withdrawal did not change the microbiome significantly beyond fecalibacterium reduction. we concluded that cirrhosis, especially when complicated with he, is associated with significant alterations in the stool microbiome compared with healthy individuals. specific bacterial families (alcaligeneceae, porphyromonadaceae, enterobacteriaceae) are strongly associated with cognition and inflammation in he.

TI  == alterations in microbiota and fermentation products in equine large intestine in  response to dietary variation and intestinal disease.
AB  == we aimed to determine the effects of variations in dietary composition on equine  gut microbiota and their fermentation products, and proposed that dietary modifications profoundly affect microbial ecosystems and their metabolites. bacterial communities within the large intestine of three groups of horses were compared using oligonucleotide-rna hybridisation methodology. each group consisting of six horses was maintained on (1) a grass-only diet, (2) a concentrate diet (i.e. supplemented with hydrolysable carbohydrates) and (3) a concentrate diet but horses were affected by simple colonic obstruction and distension (scod), a prevalent form of dietary-induced intestinal disease. we show that in response to dietary change and intestinal disease, there is a progressive and significant increase in lachnospiraceae, the bacteroidetes assemblage and the lactic acid-producing, bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus (bls) group. in contrast, there is a corresponding decrease in the proportion of  obligate fibrolytic, acid-intolerant bacteria, fibrobacter and ruminococcaceae. assessment of monocarboxylic acids indicated that there are significantly higher  concentrations of lactic acid in the colonic contents of horses maintained on a concentrate diet and those suffering from scod, correlating with the observed increase in the population abundance of the bls group. however, the population size of the veillonellaceae (lactate utilisers) remained constant in each study group. the inability of this group to respond to increased lactic acid may be a contributory factor to the build-up of lactic acid observed in horses fed a concentrate diet and those suffering from scod.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == twin study indicates loss of interaction between microbiota and mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background & aims: interactions between genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved in onset and initiation of inflammatory bowel disease. we analyzed the interaction between gastrointestinal mucosal microbiota and host genes in twin pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis (uc) to study the functional interaction between microbiota and mucosal epithelium. methods: biopsy were collected from sigmoid colon of uc patients and their healthy twins (discordant twin pairs) and from twins without uc. microbiota profiles were determined from analysis of 16s ribosomal dna libraries; messenger rna profiles were determined by microarray analysis. results: patients with uc had dysbiotic microbiota, characterized by less bacterial diversity and more actinobacteria and proteobacteria than that of their healthy siblings; healthy siblings from discordant twins had more bacteria from the lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae families than twins who were both healthy. in twins who were both healthy, 34 mucosal transcripts correlated with bacterial genera, whereas only 25 and 11 correlated with bacteria genera in healthy individuals and their twins with uc, respectively. transcripts related to oxidative and immune responses were differentially expressed between patients with uc and their healthy twins. conclusions: the transcriptional profile of the mucosa appears to interact with the colonic microbiota; this interaction appears to be lost in colon of patients  with uc. bacterial functions, such as butyrate production, might affect mucosal gene expression. patients with uc had different gene expression profiles and lower levels of biodiversity than their healthy twins, as well as unusual aerobic bacteria. patients with uc had lower percentages of potentially protective bacterial species than their healthy twins.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of the fecal microbial community in herbivorous land and marine iguanas of the galapagos islands using 16s rrna-based pyrosequencing.
AB  == herbivorous reptiles depend on complex gut microbial communities to effectively degrade dietary polysaccharides. the composition of these fermentative communities may vary based on dietary differences. to explore the role of diet in shaping gut microbial communities, we evaluated the fecal samples from two related host species--the algae-consuming marine iguana (amblyrhynchus cristatus) and land iguanas (li) (genus conolophus) that consume terrestrial vegetation. marine and li fecal samples were collected from different islands in the galapagos archipelago. high-throughput 16s rrna-based pyrosequencing was used to  provide a comparative analysis of fecal microbial diversity. at the phylum level, the fecal microbial community in iguanas was predominated by firmicutes (69.5+/-7.9%) and bacteroidetes (6.2+/-2.8%), as well as unclassified bacteria (20.6+/-8.6%), suggesting that a large portion of iguana fecal microbiota is novel and could be involved in currently unknown functions. host species differed in the abundance of specific bacterial groups. bacteroides spp., lachnospiraceae  and clostridiaceae were significantly more abundant in the marine iguanas (mi) (p-value>1e-9). in contrast, ruminococcaceae were present at >5-fold higher abundance in the li than mi (p-value>6e-14). archaea were only detected in the li. the number of operational taxonomic units (otus) in the li (356-896 otus) was >2-fold higher than in the mi (112-567 otus), and this increase in otu diversity  could be related to the complexity of the resident bacterial population and their gene repertoire required to breakdown the recalcitrant polysaccharides prevalent  in terrestrial plants. our findings suggest that dietary differences contribute to gut microbial community differentiation in herbivorous lizards. most importantly, this study provides a better understanding of the microbial diversity in the iguana gut; therefore facilitating future efforts to discover novel bacterial-associated enzymes that can effectively breakdown a wide variety  of complex polysaccharides.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

AB  == microbial biohydrogenation of dietary poly-unsaturated fatty acids (pufa) to saturated fatty acids (sfa) in the rumen results in the high ratio of sfa/pufa in ruminant products, such as meat and milk. in vitro, butyrivibrio proteoclasticus-related bacteria extensively biohydrogenate pufa to sfa, yet their contribution in the rumen has not been confirmed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group bacteria in ruminal biohydrogenation and to assess the possible role of other bacteria. fish oil at 0%, 1.5% and 3% dry matter intake was fed to eight holstein x friesian steers, in order to elicit changes in the extent of pufa biohydrogenation. fatty acid and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentrations in rumen digesta were determined. correlation between digesta 18:0 concentration and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentration was low. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) coupled with multivariate statistics revealed that many terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) and dgge bands were linked to cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla), 18:1 trans-11 and 18:0 ruminal concentrations. mica t-rf predictive identification software showed that these linked t-rfs were likely to originate from as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and ruminococcaceae. sequencing of linked dgge bands also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, anaerovoax (member of the lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified clostridiales and ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation.

AB  == the human gut is the natural habitat for a large and dynamic bacterial community  that has a great relevance for health. metagenomics is increasing our knowledge of gene content as well as of functional and genetic variability in this microbiome. however, little is known about the active bacteria and their function(s) in the gastrointestinal tract. we performed a metatranscriptomic study on ten healthy volunteers to elucidate the active members of the gut microbiome and their functionality under conditions of health. first, the microbial cdnas obtained from each sample were sequenced using 454 technology. the analysis of 16s transcripts showed the phylogenetic structure of the active microbial community. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, bacteroidaceae, prevotellaceae, and rickenellaceae were the predominant families detected in the  active microbiota. the characterization of mrnas revealed a uniform functional pattern in healthy individuals. the main functional roles of the gut microbiota were carbohydrate metabolism, energy production and synthesis of cellular components. in contrast, housekeeping activities such as amino acid and lipid metabolism were underrepresented in the metatranscriptome. our results provide new insights into the functionality of the complex gut microbiota in healthy individuals. in this rna-based survey, we also detected small rnas, which are important regulatory elements in prokaryotic physiology and pathogenicity.

TI  == spatial organization of intestinal microbiota in the mouse ascending colon.
AB  == complex microbial populations are organized in relation to their environment. in  the intestine, the inner lining (mucosa) is a potential focal point for such organization. the proximal murine colon contains mucosal folds that are known to  be associated with morphologically distinct microbes. to identify these microbes, we used the technique of laser capture microdissection (lcm) to sample microbes associated with these folds (interfold region) and within the central lumen (digesta region). using 16s rrna gene tag pyrosequencing, we found that microbes  in the interfold region were highly enriched for the phylum firmicutes and, more  specifically, for the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. other families such as bacteroidaceae, enterococcaceae and lactobacillaceae were all enriched in the digesta region. this high-resolution system to capture and examine spatial organization of intestinal microbes should facilitate microbial analysis in other mouse models, furthering our understanding of host-microbial interactions.

AB  == at present there is little quantitative information on the identity and composition of bacterial populations in the rumen microbial community. quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization using newly designed oligonucleotide probes was applied to identify the microbial populations in liquid and solid fractions of rumen digesta from cows fed barley silage or grass  hay diets with or without flaxseed. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria were abundant in both fractions, constituting 31.8 to 87.3% of the total cell numbers. they belong mainly to the order bacteroidales (0.1 to 19.2%), hybridizing with probe bac1080; the families lachnospiraceae (9.3 to 25.5%) and ruminococcaceae (5.5 to 23.8%), hybridizing with lac435 and rum831, respectively; and the classes deltaproteobacteria (5.8 to 28.3%) and gammaproteobacteria (1.2 to 8.2%). all were more abundant in the rumen communities of cows fed diets containing silage (75.2 to 87.3%) than in those of cows fed diets containing hay  (31.8 to 49.5%). the addition of flaxseed reduced their abundance in the rumens of cows fed silage-based diets (to 45.2 to 58.7%) but did not change markedly their abundance in the rumens of cows fed hay-based diets (31.8 to 49.5%). fibrolytic species, including fibrobacter succinogenes and ruminococcus spp., and archaeal methanogens accounted for only a small proportion (0.4 to 2.1% and 0.2 to 0.6%, respectively) of total cell numbers. depending on diet, between 37.0 and 91.6% of microbial cells specifically hybridized with the probes used in this study, allowing them to be identified in situ. the identities of other microbial  populations (8.4 to 63.0%) remain unknown.

TI  == a metagenomic beta-glucuronidase uncovers a core adaptive function of the human intestinal microbiome.
AB  == in the human gastrointestinal tract, bacterial beta-d-glucuronidases (bg; e.c. 3.2.1.31) are involved both in xenobiotic metabolism and in some of the beneficial effects of dietary compounds. despite their biological significance, investigations are hampered by the fact that only a few bgs have so far been studied. a functional metagenomic approach was therefore performed on intestinal  metagenomic libraries using chromogenic glucuronides as probes. using this strategy, 19 positive metagenomic clones were identified but only one exhibited strong beta-d-glucuronidase activity when subcloned into an expression vector. the cloned gene encoded a beta-d-glucuronidase (called h11g11-bg) that had distant amino acid sequence homologies and an additional c terminus domain compared with known beta-d-glucuronidases. fifteen homologs were identified in public bacterial genome databases (38-57% identity with h11g11-bg) in the firmicutes phylum. the genomes identified derived from strains from ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and clostridiaceae. the genetic context diversity, with closely related symporters and gene duplication, argued for functional diversity and contribution to adaptive mechanisms. in contrast to the  previously known beta-d-glucuronidases, this previously undescribed type was present in the published microbiome of each healthy adult/child investigated (n = 11) and was specific to the human gut ecosystem. in conclusion, our functional metagenomic approach revealed a class of bgs that may be part of a functional core specifically evolved to adapt to the human gut environment with major health implications. we propose consensus motifs for this unique firmicutes beta-d-glucuronidase subfamily and for the glycosyl hydrolase family 2.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences reveals distal gut bacterial diversity in wild wolves (canis lupus).
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the microbial communities in the distal gut of wild wolves (canis lupus). fecal samples were collected from three healthy unrelated adult wolves captured at the nearby of dalai lake nature reserve in inner mongolia of china. the diversity of fecal bacteria was investigated by constructing pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene clone libraries using the universal bacterial primers 27 f and 1493 r. a total of 307 non-chimeric near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed and 65 non-redundant bacteria phylotypes (operational taxonomical units, otus) were identified. seventeen otus (26%) showed less than 98% sequence similarity to 16s rrna gene sequences were reported previously. five different bacterial phyla were identified, with the majority of  otus being classified within the phylum firmicutes (60%), followed by bacteroidetes (16.9%), proteobacteria (9.2%), fusobacteria (9.2%) and actinobacteria (4.6%). the majority of clones fell within the order clostridiales (53.8% of otus). it was predominantly affiliated with five families: lachnospiraceae was the most diverse bacterial family in this order, followed by  ruminococcaceae, clostridiaceae, peptococcaceae and peptostreptococcaceae.

TI  == exposure of different bacterial inocula to newborn chicken affects gut microbiota development and ileum gene expression.
AB  == the transition from a sterile gut environment to the development of microbiota in the newborns is not fully understood. the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of exposure to bacterial communities on the development of gut microbiota in the newly hatched chicken. a total of 90 as-hatched chicks were divided into three groups. groups a and b were treated with inocula of the cecal  origin, whereas group c was fed with sterile water. the major bacteria in inoculum-i to treat group a included bacteroides (20.7%), lachnospiraceae (17.2%) and unclassified ruminococcaceae (16.1%), whereas group b was introduced with inoculum-ii composed of prevotella (37.9%), acidaminococcus (16.1%) and dorea (12.6%). analyses of the ileal and cecal contents over a period of 15 days showed that inoculum-i resulted in a higher rate of colonization than inoculum-ii, but the colonization was predominantly in the cecum. the influence of inoculum-ii on  group b was similar to that of water on group c, showing only a marginal effect on colonization. microarray analysis showed that each group presented a distinct  pattern of gene expression in the ileum. in group a, the most obvious changes were noted in genes controlling the function of ion transport, cell cycle and chromosome maintenance, suggesting that the inocula influenced gene expression. our findings indicate that initial exposure to different bacterial communities could lead to the development of distinct microbiota and gene expression in the gut. it is possible to manipulate the gut microbiota by feeding to a proper bacterial composition at an early age.

TI  == diversity and population structure of sewage-derived microorganisms in wastewater treatment plant influent.
AB  == the release of untreated sewage introduces non-indigenous microbial populations of uncertain composition into surface waters. we used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing of hypervariable regions in rrna genes to profile microbial communities from eight untreated sewage influent samples of two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) in metropolitan milwaukee. the sewage profiles included  a discernible human faecal signature made up of several taxonomic groups including multiple bifidobacteriaceae, coriobacteriaceae, bacteroidaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae genera. the faecal signature made up a small  fraction of the taxa present in sewage but the relative abundance of these sequence tags mirrored the population structures of human faecal samples. these genera were much more prevalent in the sewage influent than standard indicators species. high-abundance sequences from taxonomic groups within the beta- and gammaproteobacteria dominated the sewage samples but occurred at very low levels  in faecal and surface water samples, suggesting that these organisms proliferate  within the sewer system. samples from jones island (ji--servicing residential plus a combined sewer system) and south shore (ss--servicing a residential area)  wwtps had very consistent community profiles, with greater similarity between wwtps on a given collection day than the same plant collected on different days.  rainfall increased influent flows at ss and ji wwtps, and this corresponded to greater diversity in the community at both plants. overall, the sewer system appears to be a defined environment with both infiltration of rainwater and stormwater inputs modulating community composition. microbial sewage communities  represent a combination of inputs from human faecal microbes and enrichment of specific microbes from the environment to form a unique population structure.
