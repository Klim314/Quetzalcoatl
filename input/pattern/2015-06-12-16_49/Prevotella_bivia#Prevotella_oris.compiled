TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
TI  - Genetic relationships within the genus Prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - The genetic diversity and relationships within the genus Prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and DNA-DNA hybridization. MLEE revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ETs) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. The index of association described by Maynard Smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus Prevotella. A dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ETs showed that species like P. bivia, P. buccae, P. oris, P. oralis, P. nigrescens, and P. denticola form clusters that are consistent with DNA homologies. However, strains identified as P. melaninogenica or P. loescheii by DNA-DNA hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in MLEE. MLEE analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. It provides an alternative to 16S rRNA analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus Prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high DNA homology or high rRNA homology.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - Fibronectin and laminin binding of urogenital and oral prevotella species.
AB  - 88 strains of five Prevotella species--P. bivia, P. buccae, P. disiens, P. oralis, and P. oris--were examined for their fibronectin and laminin binding properties with the aid of latex particle agglutination assays. Beside single protein binding activities, all species showed strains that adhered to both fibronectin and laminin. The oral species, P. buccae, P. oralis, and P. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. The urogenital species, P. bivia and P. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with P. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than P. disiens. Within the oral species group, P. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did P. buccae and P. oris. The finding of species-related different binding properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, P. bivia and P. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, P. buccae, P. oralis, and P. oris. Moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of Prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.
TI  - A pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented Prevotella species.
AB  - Collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as Prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (CTRPs) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. PMS and CTRP classifications were compared with a previous classification based on visual analysis of SDS-PAGE patterns. Although the order of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. Cluster membership in the PMS classification correlated particularly well with SDS-PAGE results. CTRP clusters corresponded largely to the recognised species of Prevotella, but PMS and SDS-PAGE divided two species into sub-groups: two in P. buccae and five in P. veroralis. The latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in CTRPs. An undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of P. buccae strains in PMS and CTRPs. B. (P.) capillus could not be distinguished from P. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. Strains of P. zoogleoformans and B. (P.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in PMS. A complex comprising clusters of P. disiens, P. oralis, P. veroralis, P. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to P. melaninogenica was well differentiated from P. buccae and P. oris in PMS; clusters corresponding to P. bivia, P. corporis, P. intermedia and P. denticola formed another complex.
TI  - Characterisation of non-pigmented species of the genus Prevotella by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of Bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, Prevotella. The non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. A polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. Reference strains of P. oralis, P. veroralis, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. buccae, P. zoogleoformans, P. bivia, P. disiens, P. oulora, B. (P.) capillus and B. (P.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by SDS-PAGE. There was close correlation between patterns of results in biochemical and GLC tests and the SDS-PAGE profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in SDS-PAGE. The periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by SDS-PAGE; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. By SDS-PAGE, clinical isolates of P. buccae (42 isolates) and P. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. However, for P. veroralis (15), P. oris (7), P. bivia (4), P. zoogleoformans (2) and P. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. Twelve isolates remained undesignated in SDS-PAGE analysis. Variant SDS-PAGE profiles divided clinical isolates of P. buccae into two subgroups and those of P. veroralis into five subgroups.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
