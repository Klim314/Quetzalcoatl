TI  - Prevotella histicola sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - Three strains of anaerobic, variably pigmenting, Gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral mucosal tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the genus Prevotella, being most closely related to Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella veroralis. A novel species, Prevotella histicola sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. Prevotella histicola is saccharolytic and produces acetic acid and succinic acid as major end products of fermentation and trace to minor amounts of isovaleric acid and lactic acid. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 43 mol%. The type strain of Prevotella histicola is T05-04T (=DSM 19854T=CCUG 55407T).
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  - AIM: Compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a UK population using culture-independent techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Halitosis patients were screened according to our recently developed recruitment protocol. Scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The predominant species found in the control samples were Lysobacter-type species, Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Atopobium parvulum and Veillonella atypica. In the halitosis samples, Lysobacter-type species, S. salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. For the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). In the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. CONCLUSIONS: The microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.
TI  - Identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  - Gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. The confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular species within this group of organisms. This investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. Clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16S rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Forty-three reference strains of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. The phenotypic screen easily differentiated Porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. The screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. Commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of Porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to species level with the kits. Neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate Pr. intermedia and Pr. nigrescens. With the PCR method, Pr. intermedia and Pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and Porph. gingivalis was readily identified. Because of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. veroralis could not be separated by the PCR method.
TI  - A hemagglutinating variant of Prevotella melaninogenica isolated from the oral cavity.
AB  - Strains resembling Prevotella melaninogenica were isolated from healthy subjects  and patients with periodontal disease and were identified using: a 5-test phenotypic screen; commercial identification kits; and a 16S rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Eleven clinical isolates closely resembling P. melaninogenica, and all from patients with periodontitis, were able to agglutinate erythrocytes. In the electron microscope, hemagglutinating isolates showed fimbria-like structures, that were not seen on non-hemagglutinating isolates. Some strains were further classified with PCR-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes. Amplified 16S rDNA was digested using five different endonucleases, separated with agarose gel electrophoresis, stained and photographed. Photographs were then scanned, digitized and a distance matrix calculated using Dice coefficient, where the presence or absence of a band was used as a character. The distance matrix was plotted as a phenogram. At 70% similarity six clusters were seen. Type strains of separate Prevotella species did not fall into any cluster. Hemagglutinating isolates fell into three clusters: four clustered with the type strains of P. melaninogenica and Prevotella veroralis; four with other P. melaninogenica isolates and two hemagglutinating isolates clustered together Prevotella loescheii. The PCR-RFLP results showed that the hemagglutinating strains did not form a homogenous group inside the Prevotella genus.
TI  - The tet(Q) gene in bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontal disease.
AB  - Twenty-two tetracycline-resistant (tetr) anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from periodontal pockets of 12 patients with refractory periodontitis were examined for the presence of the Tet Q determinant by DNA-DNA hybridization. Dot blots of bacterial DNA were tested with an intragenic digoxigenin-labelled tet(Q) probe consisting of a 1.45 kb EcoRI/PvuII fragment from plasmid pNFD13-2. Southern blots of chromosomal DNA digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI were also examined. The tet(Q) probe hybridized with DNA from 8 of the 22 tetr strains, including 2 Prevotella intermedia strains and one strain each of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella melaninogenica. The tetr strains of Mitsuokella dentalis and Capnocytophaga ochracea also hybridized with the probe. The lack of discernible plasmid DNA in all the probe-positive isolates suggests that these tetracycline-resistance genes were chromosomally encoded. The probe hybridized with a different size fragment in all the isolates. This study extends the number of species that carry the tet(Q) gene to include several outside the genera Prevotella and Bacteroides.
TI  - Effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before treatment. Bacteroides ureolyticus, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including Capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci, staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. Root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which P. intermedia, P. asaccharolytica, the P. veroralis/buccalis complex and C. ochracea were isolated. Regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.
