TI  == shifts in microbiota species and fermentation products in a dietary model enriched in fat and sucrose.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract harbours a 'superorganism' called the gut microbiota,  which is known to play a crucial role in the onset and development of diverse diseases. this internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (hfs) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of western societies. the aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male wistar rats fed a hfs diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. for this purpose, dna extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. short-chain fatty  acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. at the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria) and class level (erisypelotrichi, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidia and bacilli). interestingly, the class clostridia showed a significant decrease after hfs diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. of particular interest, clostridium cluster xiva species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (mitsuokella jalaludinii, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridium sp. fcb90-3, prevotella nanceiensis, clostridium fusiformis, clostridium sp. bnl1100 and eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. these results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able  to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == microbial community diversity of organically rich cassava sago factory waste waters and their ability to use nitrate and n2o added as external n-sources for enhancing biomethanation and the purification efficiency.
AB  == water shortage necessitated south indian sago factory owners, extracting starch out of cassava tubers, to install biogas plants where a starch utilizing microbial community multiplies and reduces the biological oxygen demand (bod) of  the waste waters by presently about 30%. the purification efficiency of sago factory waste waters, rich in solid particles and having wide c/n ratios, around  250, through unstirred biogas plants needs to be improved. our approach was to apply instead of animal slurry nitrate (no3(-)) and nitrous oxide (n2o) as external n-sources anticipating a better n-distribution in the unstirred biogas plants. estimated cell numbers, bacterial community changes, on the basis of 16s  rrna gene clone libraries and changing co2-, ch4-, n2o releases due to the presence of nitrate or n2o suggest that acid tolerant lactobacillus spp. dominate the biogas plant inflows (ph 3.5). they were very less or not found in the outflows (ph 7.3). assumingly, the phyla bacteroidetes (prevotella spp.), proteobacteria (rhizobium spp., defluvibacter sp.), firmicutes (megasphaera spp., dialister spp., clostridium spp.) and synergistetes (thermanaerovibrio spp.), not-detectable in the biogas plant inflows, replaced them. anaerobes, about 400cellsml(-1) in the inflows, increased to about 10(6)cellsml(-1) in the outflows. the methane formation, as confirmed by the incubation experiments, suggests that methanogens must have been present among the anaerobes. in the biogas plant in- and outflows also about 300cellsml(-1) denitrifying bacteria and up to 10(4)cfu fungi were found. despite the low number of denitrifying bacteria  nitrate added to the biogas plant in- and outflows was widely consumed and added  n2o decreased considerably. thus, wide c/n ratios substrates like sago factory waste waters keep the n2o emissions low by using n2o either as electron acceptor  or by incorporating it into the growing biomass what needs to be confirmed. the biogas plant inflow samples have emitted tentatively more co2 and the outflow samples released more ch4.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), yaks (bos  grunniens) and yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in gayals, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle were investigated using pcr-dgge approach. the analysis of dgge profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16s rdna sequences in  dgge profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. dgge profiles revealed that gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of  intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. a total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. according to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen  dominant bacteria of gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the  genera lachnospiraceae bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium celerecrescens. moreover, the dominant bacteria of yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, schwartzia succinivorans and clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. in addition, the dominant bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing prevotella sp., staphylococci lentus, staphylococcus xylosus and corynebacterium casei. present study first detected staphylococcus lentus and staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == analysis of human and animal fecal microbiota for microbial source tracking.
AB  == microbial compositions of human and animal feces from south korea were analyzed and characterized. in total, 38 fecal samples (14 healthy adult humans, 6 chickens, 6 cows, 6 pigs and 6 geese) were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing of the  v2 region of the 16s rrna gene. four major phyla, actinobacteria, proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroidetes, were identified in the samples. principal coordinate analysis suggested that microbiota from the same host species generally clustered, with the exception of those from humans, which exhibited sample-specific compositions. a network-based analysis revealed that several operational taxonomic units (otus), such as lactobacillus sp., clostridium sp. and prevotella sp., were commonly identified in all fecal sources. other otus were present only in fecal samples from a single organism. for example, yania sp. and bifidobacterium sp. were identified specifically in chicken and human fecal samples, respectively. these specific otus or their respective biological markers could be useful for identifying the sources of fecal contamination in water by microbial source tracking.

TI  == diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (lama pacos) and sheep (ovis aries).
AB  == two bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. after the amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers, equal quantities of pcr products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. sequence analysis showed that the  60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with eubacterium sp. f1. the 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). clones closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, eubacterium sp. f1, clostridium cellobioparum, mogibacterium neglectum, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridiaceae bacterium wn011, clostridium coccoides, clostridium orbiscindens, eubacterium sp. f1, cytophaga sp. dex80-37, treponema bryantii and pelotomaculum sp. fp were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to anaerovorax odorimutans, treponema zioleckii, bifidobacterium indicum, paludibacter propionicigenes, paraprevotella clara, eubacterium siraeum, desulfotomaculum sp. cyp1, clostridium bolteae, clostridium termitidis and clostridiaceae bacterium djf_ls40 only in the rumen of sheep. quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16s rrna gene copies (6.89 [log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71,  p<0.01). the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == the effect of decreasing alkalinity on microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor as analyzed by pcr-sscp.
AB  == pcr-single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and southern blotting techniques were adopted to investigate microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor caused by decreasing influent alkalinity. experimental results indicated that the sulfate-removal rate approached 87% in 25 d under the conditions of influent alkalinity of 4000 mg/l (as caco3) and sulfate-loading rate of 4.8 g/(l*d), which indicated that the bioreactor started  up successfully. the analysis of microbial community structure in this stage showed that lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. were dominant populations. it was found that when influent alkalinity reduced to 1000 mg/l, sulfate-removal rate decreased rapidly to 35% in 3 d. then influent alkalinity was increased to 3000 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to 55%. under these conditions, the populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacte sp., obesumbacterium  sp. and clostridium sp. got to rich, which predominated in the community together with lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. however, when the alkalinity was decreased to 1500 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to and kept  stable at 70% and populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacter sp. and obesumbacterium sp. died out, while some strains of desulfovibrio sp. and clostridium sp. increased in concentration. in order to determine the minimum alkalinity value that the system could tolerate, the influent alkalinity was decreased from 1500 to 400 mg/l secondly. this resulted in the sulfate-removal rate, ph value and effluent alkalinity dropping quickly. the amount of petrotoga  sp., prevotella sp., kluyvera sp. and neisseria sp. reduced obviously. the result data from southern blotting indicated that the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srbs) decreased with influent alkalinity dropping. analysis of the microbial community structure and diversity showed that the srbs populations were very abundant in the inoculated activated sludge and the alkalinity decrease caused the reduction of the populations noted. most of resident populations in the bioreactor were fermentative acidogenic bacteria (fabs), among which the phylum firmicute was in the majority, but srbs were very few. this community structure demonstrates the cooperation between srbs and fabs, which sustains the  system's high sulfate-removal and operation stability.

TI  == prevotella massiliensis sp. nov. isolated from human blood.
AB  == we report a bacterial isolate (marseille isolate) recovered from the blood of a patient hospitalized in an intensive care unit, presenting with severe trauma, fever and mechanical ventilation. colonies appeared at 37 degrees c on blood agar after 72 h incubation. this isolate was a strictly anaerobic, gram-negative rod phenotypically related to other prevotella species described to date: non-motile, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, non-glucose fermenting, resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to kanamycin. cells exhibited a trilamellar membrane under electron microscopy. the fatty acid methyl ester profile was marginally related to that of clostridium botulinum group a (distance: 26.27%) and bifidobacterium bifidum gc subgroup b (distance: 26.38%). 16s rrna gene sequence  similarity was 90.0% with that of prevotella oris and 89.1% with that of prevotella melaninogenica. partial rpob gene sequence similarity was 84.5 and 86.4% with p. oris and p. melaninogenica, respectively. according to current standards, phenotypic traits, 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analyses indicated  that the marseille isolate belonged to a previously unrecognized species of the genus prevotella, and we propose classifying it in the new taxon "prevotella massiliensis" sp. nov.

TI  == urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. the types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include  para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. the anaerobes  recovered in these studies were gram-negative bacilli (including bacteroides fragilis and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp.), clostridium sp., anaerobic gram-positive cocci and actinomyces sp. in many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. the recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. these antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.

TI  == the effect of condensed tannins from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods (bacteroides sp., prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. the pathogenicity of bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium, and afgpc was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and afgpc-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. as determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative  cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and also between most afgpc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
