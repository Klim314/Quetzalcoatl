TI  == impacts of infection with different toxigenic clostridium difficile strains on faecal microbiota in children.
AB  == increasing evidence suggests that altered intestinal microbial composition and function result in an increased risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad); however, the specific changes of intestinal microbiota in children suffering from cdad and their associations with c. difficile strain toxigenicity are poorly understood. high-throughput pyrosequencing showed that reduced faecal bacterial diversity and dramatic shifts of microbial composition were found in children with cdad. the firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio was increased significantly in patients with cdad, which indicated that dysbiosis of  faecal microbiota was closely associated with cdad. c. difficile infection resulted in an increase in lactate-producing phylotypes, with a corresponding decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria. the decrease in butyrate and lactate buildup impaired intestinal colonisation resistance, which increased the susceptibility to c. difficile colonisation. strains of c. difficile which were positive for both toxin a and toxin b reduced faecal bacterial diversity to a greater degree than strains that were only toxin b-positive, and were associated  with unusually abundant enterococcus, which implies that the c. difficile toxins  have different impacts on the faecal microbiota of children. greater understanding of the relationships between disruption of the normal faecal microbiota and colonisation with c. difficile that produces different toxins might lead to improved treatment.

TI  == reset of a critically disturbed microbial ecosystem: faecal transplant in recurrent clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == recurrent clostridium difficile infection (cdi) can be effectively treated by infusion of a healthy donor faeces suspension. however, it is unclear what factors determine treatment efficacy. by using a phylogenetic microarray platform, we assessed composition, diversity and dynamics of faecal microbiota before, after and during follow-up of the transplantation from a healthy donor to different patients, to elucidate the mechanism of action of faecal infusion. global composition and network analysis of the microbiota was performed in faecal samples from nine patients with recurrent cdi. analyses were performed before and after duodenal donor faeces infusion, and during a follow-up of 10 weeks. the microbiota data were compared with that of the healthy donors. all patients successfully recovered. their intestinal microbiota changed from a low-diversity  diseased state, dominated by proteobacteria and bacilli, to a more diverse ecosystem resembling that of healthy donors, dominated by bacteroidetes and clostridium groups, including butyrate-producing bacteria. we identified specific multi-species networks and signature microbial groups that were either depleted or restored as a result of the treatment. the changes persisted over time. comprehensive and deep analyses of the microbiota of patients before and after treatment exposed a therapeutic reset from a diseased state towards a healthy profile. the identification of microbial groups that constitute a niche for c. difficile overgrowth, as well as those driving the reinstallation of a healthy intestinal microbiota, could contribute to the development of biomarkers predicting recurrence and treatment outcome, identifying an optimal microbiota composition that could lead to targeted treatment strategies.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and depletion of butyrogenic bacteria in clostridium difficile infection and nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nearly half a million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the united states each year. although the importance of the gut microbiota in c. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. culture-independent high-density roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the  distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with cdi, 36 subjects with c. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (cdn), and 40 healthy control subjects. a  total of 526,071 partial 16s rrna sequence reads of the v1 to v3 regions were aligned with 16s databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the cdi and cdn groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the firmicutes phylum. normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing c2 to c4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in  the cdi and cdn groups. these data demonstrate associations between the depletion of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including c. difficile infection. mechanistic studies focusing on the functional roles of these organisms in diarrheal diseases and resistance against c. difficile colonization are warranted.

TI  == changes in the composition of the human fecal microbiome after bacteriotherapy for recurrent clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad) is the major known cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea and colitis, and the disease is thought to result from persistent disruption of commensal gut microbiota. bacteriotherapy by way of fecal transplantation can be used to treat recurrent cdad, which is thought to reestablish the normal colonic microflora. however, limitations of conventional microbiologic techniques have, until recently, precluded testing of this idea. in this study, we used terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16s rrna gene sequencing approaches to characterize the bacterial composition of the  colonic microflora in a patient suffering from recurrent cdad before and after treatment by fecal transplantation from a healthy donor. although the patient's residual colonic microbiota, prior to therapy was deficient in members of the bacterial divisions-firmicutes and bacteriodetes, transplantation had a dramatic  impact on the composition of the patient's gut microbiota. by 14 days posttransplantation, the fecal bacterial composition of the recipient was highly  similar to that of the donor and was dominated by bacteroides spp. strains and an uncharacterized butyrate producing bacterium. the change in bacterial composition was accompanied by resolution of the patient's symptoms. the striking similarity  of the recipient's and donor's intestinal microbiota following after bacteriotherapy suggests that the donor's bacteria quickly occupied their requisite niches resulting in restoration of both the structure and function of the microbial communities present.

TI  == genes encoding homologues of three consecutive enzymes in the butyrate/butanol-producing pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum are clustered on the clostridium difficile chromosome.
AB  == screening of a clostridium difficile lambda embl3 gene library with antisera raised against c. difficile culture supernatant identified several clones expressing a 31-kda protein. a 1.8-kb hindiii fragment subcloned from one of the  clones was sufficient for expression of the 31-kda polypeptide. southern blot analysis showed a region homologous to this fragment to be present in all of 13 different c. difficile strains tested. sequence analysis of the 1.8-kb fragment revealed three adjacent open reading frames. a database search showed that these  three open reading frames appeared to encode homologues of three consecutive enzymes in the butanol/butyrate-producing pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum (crotonase, beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a dehydrogenase and thiolase).
