screening of indigenous oxalate degrading lactic acid bacteria from human faeces  and south indian fermented foods: assessment of probiotic potential.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) have the potential to degrade intestinal oxalate and this is increasingly being studied as a promising probiotic solution to manage kidney stone disease. in this study, oxalate degrading lab were isolated from human faeces and south indian fermented foods, subsequently assessed for potential probiotic property in vitro and in vivo. based on preliminary characteristics, 251 out of 673 bacterial isolates were identified as lab. a total of 17 strains were found to degrade oxalate significantly between 40.38% and 62.90% and were subjected to acid and bile tolerance test. among them, nine strains exhibited considerable tolerance up to ph 3.0 and at 0.3% bile. these were identified as lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius using 16s rdna sequencing. three strains, lactobacillus fermentum ty5, lactobacillus fermentum ab1, and lactobacillus salivarius ab11, exhibited good adhesion to ht-29 cells and strong antimicrobial activity. they also conferred resistance to kanamycin, rifampicin, and ampicillin, but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and erythromycin. the faecal recovery rate of these strains was observed as 15.16% (ty5), 6.71% (ab1), and 9.3% (ab11) which indicates the colonization ability. in conclusion, three efficient oxalate degrading lab were identified and their safety assessments suggest that they may serve as good probiotic candidates for preventing hyperoxaluria.
in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera. lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
lactic acid bacteria isolated from canine faeces.
aims: lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated and sequenced from the faeces of healthy dogs. five of these strains were selected and further characterized to clarify the potential of these strains as probiotics for canine. methods and results: lab were found in 67% (14/21) of the canine faeces samples when plated on lactobacilli selective media without acetic acid. out of 13 species identified with partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, l. mucosae lab12, l. rhamnosus lab11, l. salivarius lab9 and weissella confusa lab10 were selected as candidate probiotic strains based on their frequency, quantity in faeces, growth density, acid tolerance and antimicrobial activity. the minimal inhibitory concentration values of these isolates were determined for 14 antibiotics. l. salivarius lab9, w. confusa lab10 and l. mucosae lab12 were viable in ph 2 for 4 h (mlbs), indicating tolerance to acidity and thus the potential to survive in gastrointestinal tract of the canine. the lab8-lab12 strains showed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus a1 ncimb86166. conclusions: thirteen different lab species were found from the faecal microbiota of the healthy canines. five acid tolerant and antimicrobially active lab strains with the capacity to grow to high densities both aerobically and anaerobically were chosen to serve as candidate probiotics. significance and impact of the study: the selected lab strains are among the first host-specific lab with antimicrobial activity isolated from canines that could serve as potential probiotics for canine use.
antimicrobial potential of four lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
aims: the antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius  cect5713, lactobacillus gasseri cect5714, l. gasseri cect5715 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. methods and results: agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. the antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using a murine infection model with salmonella choleraesuis. the results revealed that all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. however, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, l. salivarius cect5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a salmonella strain in the murine infection model. conclusion: the four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly l. salivarius cect5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against s. choleraesuis cect4155 in a mouse infection model. significance and impact of the study: these results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.
lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of salmonella enteritidis (se) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. all samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. the means +/- sd of total lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. in the cloaca, lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. in the vagina, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. in the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of se. there was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. no difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. the present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against se colonization.
coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
the ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus crista and tufted streptococcus sanguis ii strains. lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with s. gordonii and s. sanguis. the coaggregation between l. salivarius and s. salivarius, s. gordonii or tufted s. sanguis ii strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. the coaggregation between l. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
