lactobacillus fermentum attenuates the proinflammatory effect of yersinia enterocolitica on human epithelial cells.
background: lactobacilli represent a major component of the human microbiota. in  this study we investigated whether and how lactobacillus fermentum inhibits the proinflammatory responses of human epithelial cells on yersinia enterocolitica infection. methods: human epithelial cells were exposed to y. enterocolitica pyv(-) or l. fermentum or to both strains, combinations of heat-killed l. fermentum or supernatant of l. fermentum cultures and y. enterocolitica. the modulation of y. enterocolitica induced il-8 levels in the culture supernatants was determined and activation of rac, p38, and nf-kappab was investigated. results: exposure of human epithelial cells to l. fermentum does not induce nf-kappab activation and subsequent il-8 secretion in hela cells, whereas y. enterocolitica induces nf-kappab activation and high levels of il-8. viable l. fermentum, supernatant of l. fermentum cultures, but not heat-killed l. fermentum, inhibited il-8 secretion of hela cells triggered by y. enterocolitica. lactobacillus fermentum-exposed hela cells showed decreased rac, p38, and nf-kappab activation after y. enterocolitica infection. treatment of l. fermentum supernatants with phospholipase c abolished the inhibitory effect, indicating that a secreted phospholipid mediates the antiinflammatory properties of l. fermentum. adhesion to or invasion of y. enterocolitica into epithelial cells was not altered by coincubation with l. fermentum. conclusion: our results lead to the conclusion that l. fermentum inhibits the y. enterocolitica-induced il-8 production by a possibly secreted phospholipid of <10 kda molecular weight. these data suggest that l. fermentum may have probiotic properties modulating intestinal inflammatory responses and might offer new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory diseases.
