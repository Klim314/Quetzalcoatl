TI  == [effects of mono-, poly- and composite probiotics on the ulceration caused by restraint stress].
AB  == it was studied the effect of probiotic strains of bifidobacterium animalis vkl, bifidobacterium animalis vkb and lactobacillus casei imvb-7280, and their mixtures on erosive and ulcerative lesions of the gastric mucosa (gm) of rats. gm was induced by water-immersion restraint stress. it was found that investigated probiotics did not have gastroprotective properties under a single and seven-day  prophylactic administration. however, multiprobiotics (polyprobiotic bifidobacterium animalis vkl and bifidobacterium animalis vkb and composite probiotic bifidobacterium animalis vkl, bifidobacterium animalis vkb and lactobacillus casei imvb-7280) reduced the erosive and ulcerative lesions and the intensity of bleeding in rat gm when given within 14 days. it was shown that one  of the mechanisms of antiulcer preventive effect of the multistrain probiotics is the restoration of pro/antioxidant balance in the gm under the stress action. the obtained results show the effectiveness of poly- and composite probiotics in the  gastric ulcer prevention.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == selenite-stress selected mutant strains of probiotic bacteria for se source production.
AB  == selenium deficiency is a major health problem worldwide for about 1 billion people. bacterial cells usually possess low tolerance to selenite stress and also low ability to reduce high concentrations of toxic selenite. here, high tolerance to selenite and selenium bioaccumulation capability were developed in mutated clones of probiotic and starter bacteria including enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis by food-level strain development process and clone selection. all mutant clones possessed increased glutathione concentration and glutathione reductase activity. the selenite treatment increased further these values in l. casei mutant strain pointing at a different selenite reduction pathway and/or stress response in this organism. considerable conversion of selenite to cell bound selenium forms with a concomitant high biomass production was detected in e. faecium and b. animalis ssp. lactis cultures. possible application of these strains as food and feed supplements is under investigation.

TI  == evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to test the suitability of transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (tos-mup) and mrs-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (mrs-cc) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab)  species commonly used to make fermented milks. pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. tos-mup agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and b. breve m-16 v. mrs-cc agar showed relatively good selectivity for lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of lb. casei strains. for this reason, mrs-cc agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of lb. acidophilus if lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of lb. acidophilus.  unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped lab, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in mrs ph 5.4 agar incubated under  anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for 72 h. therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == immunoreactivity of lactic acid-treated mare's milk after simulated digestion.
AB  == the similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. the aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid  fermentation with lactobacillus casei lcy, streptococcus thermophilus mk10 and bifidobacterium animalis bi30. simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. the immunoreactivity of the milk proteins  was assessed by competitive elisa. the separation of proteins was studied using a tricine sds-page method. it has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein,  kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. the level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. the simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. the results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. however, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.

TI  == [the effect of probiotic therapy on development of experimental obesity in rats caused by monosodium glutamate].
AB  == the effect of a mixture of probiotic strains (2:1:1 lactobacillus casei imvb-7280, bifidobacterium animalis vkl, bifidobacterium animalis vkb) on the development of experimental obesity in rats induced by neonatal administration of monosodium glutamate has been studied. it was shown that in rats of 4 months age, the injection of monosodium glutamate (4 mg/g) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 days after birth elicited abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome. an intermittent administration of a probiotic mixture to rats treated with monosodium prevented the development  of obesity. in the group of rats treated with probiotics, anthropometric parameters (weight and body length, lee index, body mass index) did not differ from the level of intact rats. visceral fat mass was decreased by probiotics by 38.5% (p < 0.05) compared to rats treated with water. probiotics improved lipid metabolism: reduced the level of vldl by 32.2% (p < 0,05), the level of ldl by 30.6% (p < 0.05), increased hdl by 25.7% (p <0,05) compared to obese control rats. probiotic strains restored the secretion of adipocytes hormones (leptin and adiponectin) to the normal level of intact animals. the results show the effectiveness of probiotics for the prevention of obesity.

TI  == probiotic bacteria survive in cheddar cheese and modify populations of other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: starter lactic acid bacteria in cheddar cheese face physico-chemical stresses during manufacture and ageing that alter their abilities to survive and  to interact with other bacterial populations. nonstarter bacteria are derived from milk handling, cheese equipment and human contact during manufacture. probiotic bacteria are added to foods for human health benefits that also encounter physiological stresses and microbial competition that may mitigate their survival during ageing. we added probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei and bifidobacterium animalis subsp.  lactis to full-fat, reduced-fat and low-fat cheddar cheeses, aiming to study their survival over 270 days of ageing and to determine the role of the cheese matrix in their survival. methods and results: probiotic and other lactic acid bacterial populations were enumerated by quantitative pcr using primers specifically targeting the different bacterial genera or species of interest. bifidobacteria were initially added at 10(6) cfu g(-1) cheese and survived variably in the different cheeses over the 270-day ageing process. probiotic lactobacilli that were added at 10(7) cfu g(-1) cheese and incident nonstarter lactobacilli (initially at 10(8) cfu g(-1) cheese) increased by 10- to 100-fold over 270 days. viable bacterial populations were differentiated using propidium monoazide followed by species-specific qpcr assays, which demonstrated that the starter and probiotic microbes survived over ageing, independent of cheese type.  addition of probiotic bacteria, at levels 100-fold below that of starter bacteria, modified starter and nonstarter bacterial levels. conclusions: we demonstrated that starter lactococci, nonstarter lactobacilli and probiotic bacteria are capable of surviving throughout the cheesemaking and ageing process, indicating that delivery via hard cheeses is possible. probiotic addition at lower levels may also alter starter and nonstarter bacterial survival. significance and impact of the study: we applied qpcr to study multispecies survival and viability and distinctly enumerated bacterial species in commercial-scale cheddar cheese manufacture.

TI  == thermopressurized diluted phosphoric acid pretreatment of ligno(hemi)cellulose to make free sugars and nutraceutical oligosaccharides.
AB  == ligno(hemi)cellulosics (l(h)cs) as sugarcane bagasse and loblolly pine sawdust are currently being used to produce biofuels such as bioethanol and biobutanol through fermentation of free sugars that are often obtained enzymatically. however, this bioconversion requires a pretreatment to solubilize the hemicellulose fractions, thus facilitating the action of the cellulolytic enzymes. instead of the main free monosaccharides used in these current models, the modulation of thermopressurized orthophosphoric acid as a pretreatment, in the ranges of 3-12 atm and ph 1.5-2.5, can produce nondigestible oligosaccharides (ndos) such as xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) because heteroxylan is present in both types of hardwood and softwood hemicelluloses. a comparative thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the hydrolytic products showed the best conditions for ndos production to be 7 atm/water, ph 2.25 and 2.50, and 8.5 atm/water for both sources. particular hydrolysates from 7 atm (171 degrees c) at phs 2.25 and  2.50 both for cane bagasse and pine sawdust, with respective oligosaccharide contents of 57 and 59 %, once mixed in a proportion of 1:1 for each plant source, were used in vitro as carbon sources for bifidobacterium or lactobacillus. once both bacteria attained the stationary phase of growth, an unforeseen feature emerged: the preference of b. animalis for bagasse hydrolysates and, conversely,  the preference of l. casei for pine hydrolysates. considering the fact that nutraceutical oligosaccharides from both hemicelluloses correspond to higher value-added byproducts, the technology using a much diluted thermopressurized orthophosphoric acid pretreatment becomes an attractive choice for l(h)cs.

TI  == immune system stimulation by probiotic microorganisms.
AB  == probiotic organisms are claimed to offer several functional properties including  stimulation of immune system. this review is presented to provide detailed informations about how probiotics stimulate our immune system. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, bifidobacterium lactis dr10, and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii are the most investigated probiotic cultures for their immunomodulation properties. probiotics can enhance nonspecific cellular immune response characterized by activation of macrophages, natural killer (nk) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in strain-specific and dose-dependent manner. mixture and type (gram-positive and gram-negative) of probiotic organisms may induce different cytokine responses. supplementation of probiotic organisms in infancy could help prevent immune-mediated diseases in childhood, whereas their intervention in pregnancy could affect fetal immune parameters, such as cord blood interferon (ifn)-gamma levels, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 levels, and breast milk immunoglobulin (ig)a. probiotics that can be delivered via fermented milk or yogurt could improve the gut mucosal immune system by increasing the number of iga(+) cells and cytokine-producing cells in the effector site of the intestine.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == assessment of the effect of stress-tolerance acquisition on some basic characteristics of specific probiotics.
AB  == the production of viable functional probiotics presupposes stability of strain features in the final product. we evaluated the impact of acquisition of heat-tolerance and subsequent freeze-drying on the adhesion properties of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and bifidobacterium animalis if20/1 and on their ability to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens in a mucus model. both fresh and freeze-dried cultures were evaluated. significant differences were observed between fresh, freeze dried, fresh heat-tolerant and freeze dried heat-tolerant strains, especially in the ability of the freeze dried probiotics to exclude, displace or outcompete pathogens. based on our study characterizing probiotic properties such as adhesion and competitive exclusion, it seems possible to adapt probiotics to processing stresses, such as heat, without significantly changing the probiotic properties of the strains assessed. this may provide new options for future probiotic production technology. however, our results also emphasize that the properties of the stress-adapted strains, as well as the effect of the production processes should always be assessed as these are strain-specific.

TI  == bioactivity of probiotic whey cheese: characterization of the content of peptides and organic acids.
AB  == background: probiotic whey cheeses have been produced for several years. it is recognized that several bacterium-mediated metabolic activities contribute differently to the final sensory and nutritional profiles of dairy products. hence the metabolic activity of probiotic strains in a whey cheese and their contribution to the bioactivity of such matrices were investigated here, including in particular bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei. results: both l. casei and b. animalis produce lactic and acetic acids, whereas l. acidophilus produce mainly lactic acid; these metabolites may be considered bioprotection factors. water-soluble extracts (wse) obtained from these cheese matrices were subjected to ultrafiltration through a 3 kda cut-off membrane, and the eluted peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. different qualitative and quantitative profiles were obtained, depending on the strain. wse were further assayed for their ability to  inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme; the <3 kda fraction exhibited higher activities in the case of l. casei and b. animalis than the control and l. acidophilus. conclusion: whey cheeses with higher nutritional value were those inoculated with l. casei.

TI  == gut balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  == synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. a double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of gut balance, which contains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (l. casei 431(r)), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12(r)), lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5(r)), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg(r)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain  fatty acids (scfa), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. all subjects randomized were included in the analysis. there was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal l. paracasei numbers with gut balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. gut balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum il-16 in comparison to acacia gum  from pre- to post-study. no substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal scfa concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or gi permeability. clinical studies are now required to determine whether gut balance may exert beneficial gi health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal l. paracasei. both supplements had little effect on immunity. twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.

AB  == for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == probiotic cheddar cheese: influence of ripening temperatures on proteolysis and sensory characteristics of cheddar cheeses.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum 1941, b. animalis subsp. lactis lafti b94, lactobacillus casei 279, lb. casei lafti l26, lb. acidophilus 4962, or lb. acidophilus lafti l10 were used as an adjunct in the production of cheddar cheeses, which were ripened at 4 and 8 degrees c for 24 wk. effects of ripening temperatures and probiotic adjuncts on proteolysis and sensory evaluation of the cheeses were examined. higher ripening temperature increased the level of proteolysis in the cheeses. product of proteolysis and organic acids released during ripening were shown to be important for the flavor of cheddar cheeses. there were positive and  significant correlations between the levels of soluble nitrogen, lactic, acetic,  and butyric acids, percentage hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-cn and beta-cn to the scores of cheddary flavor (p < 0.05). scores for sour-acid and vinegary flavors were higher in cheeses with the addition of bifidobacterium sp. or lb. casei 279  ripened at 8 degrees c. the scores were positively and significantly correlated to the level of lactic, acetic, and free amino acids in the cheeses (p < 0.05). the results show that both 4 and 8 degrees c have potential for use in the ripening of probiotic cheddar cheeses.

TI  == comparative study of bifidobacterium animalis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii probiotic properties.
AB  == the present work investigates some probiotic properties of four different microorganisms (bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb-12, escherichia coli emo, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii). in vitro and in vivo tests were carried out to compare cell wall hydrophobicity, production of antagonistic substances, survival capacity in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice without pathological consequence, and immune modulation by stimulation of kupffer cells, intestinal siga and il-10 levels. in vitro antagonism against pathogenic bacteria and yeast was only observed for the probiotic bacteria b. animalis and l. casei. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was higher for b. animalis and e. coli emo, and this property could be responsible for a better ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice. higher levels of siga were observed mainly for s. boulardii, followed by e. coli emo and b. animalis, and only s. boulardii induced a significant higher level of il-10. in conclusion, for a probiotic use, s. boulardii presented better characteristics in terms of immunomodulation, and b. animalis and l. casei for antagonistic substance production. the knowledge of the different probiotic properties could be used to  choice the better microorganism depending on the therapeutic or prophylactic application.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == endogenous beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities from selected probiotic micro-organisms and their role in isoflavone biotransformation in soymilk.
AB  == aim: to compare endogenous beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases for hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glycosides into isoflavone aglycones in  order to improve biological activity of soymilk. methods and results: beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities of probiotic organisms including lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4461, lactobacillus casei 2607 and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 in soymilk were evaluated and correlated with the increase in concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. the concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a varian model high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with an amperometric electrochemical detector. in all micro-organisms, beta-glucosidase activity was found greater than that of beta-galactosidase. there was an increase in the aglycone concentration with incubation time because  of the apparent hydrolytic action on isoflavone glycosides. aglycone concentration in the soymilk with l. acidophilus 4461, l. casei 2607 and b. animalis ssp. lactis bb12, increased by 5.37-, 5.52- and 6.10-fold, respectively, after 15 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the maximum hydrolytic potential was  also observed at 15 h of fermentation for the three micro-organims coinciding with peak activities of the two enzymes. conclusions: beta-glucosidase activity was more than 15 times higher than beta-galactosidase activity in soymilk for each of the micro-organisms during fermentation. beta-glucosidase played a greater role in isoflavone glycoside hydrolysis. significance and impact of the study: screening for beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities among probiotics in soymilk is important for the improvement of biological activity of  soymilk and in the selection of micro-organisms for use in the growing industry of functional foods and beverages.

TI  == a comparison of changes in the transformation of isoflavones in soymilk using varying concentrations of exogenous and probiotic-derived endogenous beta-glucosidases.
AB  == aims: to compare endogenous and exogenous beta-glucosidases for the hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glucosides in soymilk in order to improve the biological activity. methods and results: beta-glucosidase activity of probiotic  organisms, including bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4461 and lactobacillus casei 2607 in soymilk, was evaluated and  was related to the increase in the concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. the concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a varian model hplc with an amperometric electrochemical detector. the aglycone composition, also known as aglycone equivalent ratio, has  been considered to be important for the delivery of health benefits of isoflavones, and was monitored during the fermentation of soymilk. comparison of  the hydrolytic effectiveness of both exogenous and endogenous enzyme during 4-h incubation in soymilk was conducted using the otieno-shah (o-s) index. results showed that exogenous enzyme exhibited faster rate of isoflavone glucoside hydrolysis than that by endogenous enzyme. highest o-s indices were obtained after 4, 3 and 2 h of incubation with enzyme solution having beta-glucosidase activity of 0.288 u ml(-1), 0.359 u ml(-1) and 0.575 u ml(-1), resulting into aglycone concentration increments of 5.87-, 6.07- and 5.94-fold, respectively. conversely, aglycone concentration in the soymilk with b. animalis ssp. lactis bb12, l. casei 2607 and l. acidophilus 4461 increased by 3.43-, 2.72- and 3.03-fold, respectively, after 4 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. in addition,  the o-s index of endogenous enzyme was much lower than that of the exogenous enzyme over the same 4-h incubation period. optimum aglycone equivalent ratios coincided with highest o-s indices and highest aglycone concentrations in soymilk hydrolysed with exogenous enzyme. the same correlation of o-s indices and highest aglycone concentrations occurred for endogenous enzyme during the 24 h of fermentation. conclusions: obtaining highest aglycone concentration and optimum aglycone equivalent ratio could provide a critical beginning point in clinical trials for the realization of unique health benefits of soy isoflavones. significance and impact of the study: screening for beta-glucosidase activities of probiotics in soymilk and comparing their hydrolytic potentials with that of exogenous beta-glucosidase could find wide applications in the development of different aglycone-rich functional soy beverages.

TI  == selected prebiotics support the growth of probiotic mono-cultures in vitro.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to identify suitable prebiotics for synergistic  combinations with representative probiotics from the lactobacilli and bifidobacterium genera. eleven different types of commercially available carbohydrates and compounds were screened in basal media for their effects on the growth of the probiotic cultures lactobacillus acidophilus lafti l10 (l10), bifidobacterium animalis lactis lafti b94 (b94) and lactobacillus casei lafti l26 (l26). growth of these probiotics was investigated by measuring optical density (od) levels over a period of 48 h. the results of this study showed that all three probiotic strains were able to utilize a range of carbohydrates. maximal growth of l10 was observed in basal medium supplemented with soybean oligosaccharide (sos), followed by fructooligosaccharide (fos) and inulin, while  maximal growth of b94 was observed in basal medium supplemented with sos, followed by raffinose, fos, beta-glucan hydrolysate, inulin and fibregum tan. l26 was shown to exhibit maximal growth in basal medium supplemented with fos followed by inulin, sos, beta-glucan hydrolysate and beta-glucan concentrate. the results of this study indicate that several carbohydrates/compounds can enhance the growth of these representative probiotic strains in vitro.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == effect of a probiotic food as an adjuvant to triple therapy for eradication of helicobacter pylori infection in children.
AB  == objective: current recommendations for treatment of helicobacter pylori infection include a proton pump inhibitor in combination with two antibiotics. we evaluated the potential activity of a probiotic food as an adjuvant to antibiotic triple therapy for eradication of h. pylori infection in children from buenos aires, argentina. methods: sixty-five children who tested positive for h. pylori, as diagnosed by (13)c-urea breath test and endoscopy, were included in this study. patients were randomized to receive 1-wk triple therapy plus probiotic food (treated group) or milk placebo (control) that was administered for 3 mo. probiotic food consisted of 250 ml of a commercial yogurt containing bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei (10(7) colony-forming units/ml). post-treatment urea breath test controls were performed 1 and 3 mo after the end  of triple therapy. results: we found no significant differences in h. pylori eradication rates (ers) at 1 and 3 mo between the treated group (er = 45.5% and 42.4%) and the control group (er = 37.5% and 40.6%). relative risks between groups were 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.58-1.32, p = 0.345) in the first month and 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.64-1.46, p = 0.542) in the third month. conclusions: we could not demonstrate an adjuvant effect of the studied probiotic food to triple therapy in the eradication of h. pylori infection in children in buenos aires, argentina. however, we found lower ers than those reported for the  same therapeutic scheme in developed countries, indicating that bacterial resistance and alternative therapeutic strategies should be studied.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  == four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. each bacterial species and candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. the presence of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, or bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with c. albicans alone. the incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. the numbers of c. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by l. casei gg and b. animalis. none of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but b. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to c. albicans. the prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of c. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.

TI  == colonization of congenitally immunodeficient mice with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == we assessed the capacity of four probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, and bifidobacterium animalis) to colonize, infect, stimulate immune responses in, and affect the growth and survival of congenitally immunodeficient gnotobiotic beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu)  and beige-euthymic (bg/bg-nu/+) mice. the bacteria colonized and persisted, in pure culture, in the alimentary tracts of both mouse strains for the entire study period (12 weeks). although all adult and neonatal beige-euthymic mice survived probiotic colonization, some infant mortality occurred in beige-athymic pups born to mothers colonized with pure cultures of l. reuteri or l. casei gg. the probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required.
