TI  == fermentable non-starch polysaccharides increases the abundance of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas in ileal microbial community of growing pigs.
AB  == most plant-origin fiber sources used in pig production contains a mixture of soluble and insoluble non-starch polysaccharides (nsp). the knowledge about effects of these sources of nsp on the gut microbiota and its fermentation products is still scarce. the aim of this study was to investigate effects of feeding diets with native sources of nsp on the ileal and fecal microbial composition and the dietary impact on the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and lactic acid. the experiment comprised four diets and four periods in a change-over design with seven post valve t-cecum cannulated growing  pigs. the four diets were balanced to be similar in nsp content and included one  of four fiber sources, two diets were rich in pectins, through inclusion of chicory forage (cfo) and sugar beet pulp, and two were rich in arabinoxylan, through inclusion of wheat bran (wb) and grass meal. the gut microbial composition was assessed with terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and the abundance of lactobacillus spp., enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas and the beta-xylosidase gene, xynb, were assessed with quantitative pcr. the gut microbiota did not cluster based on nsp structure (arabinoxylan or pectin) rather, the effect was to a high degree ingredient specific. in pigs fed diet cfo, three trfs related to prevotellaceae together consisted of more than 25% of the fecal microbiota, which is about 3 to  23 times higher (p<0.05) than in pigs fed the other diets. whereas pigs fed diet  wb had about 2 to 22 times higher abundance (p<0.05) of megasphaera elsdenii in feces and about six times higher abundance (p<0.05) of lactobacillus reuteri in ileal digesta than pigs fed the other diets. the total amount of digested nsp (r=0.57; p=0.002), xylose (r=0.53; p=0.004) and dietary fiber (r=0.60; p=0.001) in ileal digesta were positively correlated with an increased abundance of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas. the effect on scfa was correlated to specific neutral sugars where xylose increased the ileal butyric acid proportion, whereas arabinose increased the fecal butyric acid proportion. moreover, chicory  pectin increased the acetic acid proportion in both ileal digesta and feces.

TI  == stimulation of butyrate production by gluconic acid in batch culture of pig cecal digesta and identification of butyrate-producing bacteria.
AB  == gluconic acid reaches the large intestine to stimulate lactic acid bacteria. however, the fermentation pattern of gluconic acid has yet to be elucidated. accordingly, we examined the fermentation properties induced by gluconic acid in  the pig cecal digesta in vitro. we also tested sorbitol and glucose, substrates for which the fermentation rate and patterns are known. the gluconic acid-utilizing bacteria were further isolated from pig cecal digesta and identified to examine the effect of gluconic acid on hind gut fermentation. gluconic acid was fermented more slowly than were the other two substrates. gluconic acid stimulated butyrate production; the butyrate molar percentage reached 26%, which is considered a high butyrate production. the majority of gluconic acid fermenters were identified as lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacillus reuteri and l. mucosae, and acid-utilizing bacteria, such as megasphaera elsdenii and mitsuokella multiacida. the gluconic acid fermented by lactic acid bacteria, and the lactate and acetate that were produced were used to form butyrate by acid-utilizing bacteria, such as m. elsdenii. gluconic acid may  be useful as a prebiotic to stimulate butyrate production in the large intestine.
