exogenous lactobacilli fed to man - their fate and ability to prevent diarrheal disease.
clinical and microbiologic studies were conducted to evaluate the capability of exogenous lactobacilli to implant in the upper small intestine, the ability of exogenous lactobacilli to prevent enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) diarrhea, and the effect of lactobacillus therapy in reduction of diarrhea due to neomycin.
microbiologic studies of jejunal aspirates indicated that orally ingested lactobacillus acidophilus and l. bulgaricus in lactinexr and l. acidophilus in infloran bernar survived passage through the stomach and remained viable in the proximal small bowel for three to six hours in most, not all, individuals.
challenge studies with etec revealed that despite the ability of lactobacilli in lactinexr to persist in the upper small intestine for several hours, the lactobacillus preparation did not prevent or alter the course of etec diarrhea in adults.
lactobacillus therapy with one lot of lactinexr reduced the volume and duration of neomycin-associated diarrhea, whereas another lot of lactinexr had no therapeutic effect.
thus, lot to lot variations in lactobacillus preparations may account for some conflicting results observed with lactobacillus therapy for intestinal disorders.
