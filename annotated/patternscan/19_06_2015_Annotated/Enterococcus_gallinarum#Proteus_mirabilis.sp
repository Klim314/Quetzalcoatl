TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == proteolytic bacteria in the lower digestive tract of poultry may affect avian influenza virus pathogenicity.
AB  == proteolytic cleavage of hemagglutinin is required for cell entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis and plays a key role in pathogenicity of the influenza virus. despite several studies describing relationships between bacterial proteases and influenza a viral activation in mammals, very little is known about the role of the normal bacterial flora of birds on hemagglutinin activation. we examined the indigenous intestinal microflora of 100 mixed-sex, 27-d-old ross chickens from a commercial poultry facility for protease-secreting  bacteria. protease-secreting bacteria were isolated from 82 of 100 chickens with  50 birds exhibiting 2 or more protease-secreting bacterial species. a total of 20 protease-secreting bacterial species were identified: 17 gram-positive cocci, 2 gram-positive rods, and 1 gram-negative rod. enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  gallinarum, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequently observed protease-secreting bacterial species. the presence of proteolytic bacteria in the intestinal tract of poultry in this study suggests the possibility of yet-to-be-described role(s) in cleavage of hemagglutinin that may alter the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == chronic inflammatory state and chronic infections appear to be one of the most important risk factors of morbidity and mortality in patients (pts) on dialysis.  the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of urinary tract infections (uti) in clinically asymptomatic patients on capd. the study included 43 (22f, 21m) clinically stable asymptomatic capd patients with diuresis ranged from 300 to 2500 ml per 24 h. clean catch urine specimen, was cultured and identified by standard technique. urine from 31 patients had no significant organism growth, from 12 patients grew over 100,000 colonies per ml; 8 patients had been infected  with e. coli, 2 pts with proteus mirabilis, one with enterococcus gallinarum, one with klebsiella oxytocea. 7/12 infected pts were diabetic, 67% infected and 13% not infected pts had pyuria. conclusions: immune system disturbance and renal failure can predispose to common asymptomatic uti in capd pts. e. coli is the most common bacterial strain found in infected dialysis pts. diabetes mellitus is and additional predisposing factor for uti in patients on capd. pyuria is a valuable parameter of uti in capd patients.

TI  == a survey of sixty turkey flocks exhibiting hepatic foci taken at time of processing.
AB  == fifty turkey flocks including 24 16-week-old male flocks and 26 20-week-old male  flocks were sampled at time of processing. hepatic foci were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the majority of these did not have any bacteria recovered from the lesions. of the bacteria that were recovered, most were facultative anaerobes, with escherichia coli and salmonella sp. comprising the most common isolates. all of the birds examined (300 total) for parasites were infected with  varying levels of ascaridia dissimilis. the highest average worm burden was found in the 20-week-old flocks. heterakis gallinarum were found in only a few of the younger turkeys (16 weeks old) and not in any of the older birds. an analysis of  the spatial distribution of the hepatic foci performed in an additional 10 turkey flocks (500 birds) revealed that, although present on the surface of all regions  of the liver, 56.12% of the lesions were found on the left hepatic lobe and 43.88% were found on the right hepatic lobe.
