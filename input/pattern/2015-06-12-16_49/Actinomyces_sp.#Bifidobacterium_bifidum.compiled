TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - Phylogenetic evidence for the transfer of Eubacterium suis to the genus Actinomyces as Actinomyces suis comb. nov.
AB  - The 16S rRNA primary structures of Eubacterium suis DSM 20639T (T = type strain)  and Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20456T were determined by sequencing in vitro amplified rDNA. Sequence comparisons indicated that B. bifidum is moderately related to representatives of the genera Actinomyces and Mobiluncus. The closest relative of E. suis is Actinomyces pyogenes. E. suis and A. pyogenes are more closely related phylogenetically to one another than to the other Actinomyces species that have been investigated by using comparative 16S rRNA analysis. Therefore, we propose that E. suis should be transferred to the genus Actinomyces as Actinomyces suis comb. nov.
TI  - Partial 16S rRNA primary structure of five Actinomyces species: phylogenetic implications and development of an Actinomyces israelii-specific oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - The intra- and intergeneric relationships of the genus Actinomyces were determined by comparing long 16S rRNA sequences, generated by reverse transcriptase. All species formed a phylogenetically coherent cluster in which Actinomyces bovis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus and A. israelii constituted genetically well defined species. A. israelii DSM 43322 (serotype 2) was not closely related to three other strains of this species (serotype 1) and, as judged from phylogenetic distances, could be accommodated within A. naeslundii, or represent a new species. In contrast to previous findings, members of the genus Actinomyces appear to be related to Bifidobacterium bifidum. Sequence information was used to develop an oligonucleotide probe for the A. israelii serotype 1 strains, which did not react with the serotype 2 strain or with rRNA from strains of eight Actinomyces species.
TI  - Lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  - The respiratory quinones of 73 strains of Gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. Menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (MK-7) were the main quinone type found in representatives of the genus Bacillus and in Sporolactobacillus inulinus. However, a strain of B. thuringiensis produced MK-8 in addition to MK-7, and strains of B. lentus and B. pantothenticus appeared to produce MK-9 and MK-8, respectively, with no MK-7. In the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in Pediococcus cerevisiae NCTC 8066 and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, which contained menaquinones, and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 and HIM 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. Menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes (except Actinomyces odontolyticus and Bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in Protaminobacter alboflavus ATCC 8458, the so-called Actinobacillus actinoides ATCC 15900 and Noguchia granulosis NCTC 10559.
TI  - Antibacterial sensitivity of Bifidobacterium (Lactobacillus bifidus).
AB  - The antibacterial sensitivity patterns of gram-positive, nonsporeforming, anaerobic bacilli variously classed as Lactobacillus bifidus, Actinomyces bifidus, or Bifidobacterium were studied by the plate dilution method. A total of 34 strains, mostly from human feces, was studied. Three species, B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum, were represented with 11, 11, and 6 strains, respectively. The other six strains fell into four other species. Most strains of all types resisted 100 mug/ml or more of neomycin, polymyxin B, and nalidixic acid. They were somewhat less resistant to kanamycin and still less so to streptomycin. All strains were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml of penicillin G and erythromycin, by 3.1 units or less per ml of bacitracin, by 3.1 mug/ml or less of chloramphenicol, and by 6.2 mug/ml or less of tetracycline and lincomycin. Most strains were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml of vancomycin. Results were very variable with cephalothin and nitrofurantoin, with some strains quite resistant. With half of the drugs tested, there were moderate differences in sensitivity between different species. These data are discussed in relation to the effect of antimicrobial agents on bifid bacilli in the normal human fecal flora, in relation to the implications thereof, and in relation to the usefulness of several agents (particularly neomycin, nalidixic acid, and polymyxin B) in selective media for Bifidobacterium.
