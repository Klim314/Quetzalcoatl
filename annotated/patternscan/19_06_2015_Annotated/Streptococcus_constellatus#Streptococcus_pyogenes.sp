TI  == identification of beta-haemolysin-encoding genes in streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is an emerging pathogen, but little is known about its virulence factors. to detect the genes responsible for beta-haemolysis we performed genomic mutagenesis of the beta-haemolytic s. anginosus type strain atcc 12395 using the vector pghost9:iss1. integration site analysis of 15 non-haemolytic mutants identified a gene cluster with high homology to the genes  of the streptolysin s (sls) encoding sag gene cluster of s. pyogenes. the gene cluster harbours 10 open reading frames displaying significant similarities to the s. pyogenes genes saga-sagi, with the identities on protein level ranging from 38 to 87%. complementation assays of s. anginosus sagb and sagd integration  mutants with the respective genes confirmed their importance for beta-haemolysin  production and suggest the presence of post-translational modifications in s. anginosus sls similar to sls of s. pyogenes. characterization of the s. anginosus haemolysin in comparison to the s. pyogenes sls showed that the haemolysin is surface bound, but in contrast to s. pyogenes neither fetal calf serum nor rna was able to stabilize the haemolysin of s. anginosus in culture supernatants. inhibition of beta-haemolysis by polyethylene glycol of different sizes was carried out, giving no evidence of a pore-forming haemolytic mechanism. analysis  of a whole genome shotgun sequence of streptococcus constellatus, a closely related streptococcal species that belongs to the s. anginosus group, revealed a  similar sag gene cluster. employing a genomic mutagenesis strategy we were able to determine an sls encoding gene cluster in s. anginosus and demonstrate its importance for beta-haemolysin production in s. anginosus.

TI  == [problems with identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcus resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis].
AB  == introduction: the genus streptococcus comprises a number of species characterized by a differential pathogenic potential. these bacteria can be considered as members of microbial physiological flora but they can also cause mild infections  or severe, life threatening conditions. the majority of infections of streptococcal etiology are caused by beta-hemolysing species. the predominant causative agent of bacterial pharyngitis is streptococcus pyogenes. this species  usually doesn't give rise to any identification difficulties due to the introduction the well determined diagnostic schemes. problems concerning laboratory identification can be, however, associated with other species of beta-hemolysing streptococci isolated from patients with pharyngitis. these streptococci can demonstrate features similar to those of s. pyogenes and share the group antygen a, such as some strains of streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the determination of sensitivity to bacitracin, which is a feature typical of s. pyogenes, is the basic test useful for its preliminary identification. nevertheless, the identification of some strains by this test can give rise to incompatibility. the aim of the study  was characterisation of beta-hemolysing streptococci resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis. the examined bacterial strains caused identification problems by the use of routine diagnostic methods. methods: the material included 14 streptococcal strains resistant to bacitracin which were isolated from adult patients suffering from pharyngitis. the bacteria were cultured on media dedicated for the species. the following routine diagnostic tests were used for the bacterial identification: sensitivity to bacitracin (0.04 u/disc), camp test, determination of the group antigens a, b, c, d, f and g (slidex strepto-kit), and determination of biochemical features by the api 20 strep test (biomerieux). the sensitivity of streptococcal isolates to antibiotics (penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, ofloxacin) and  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was determined by the disc diffusion method on the mueller-hinton agar with 5% sheep blood (the inoculum-0.5 mcfarland). results: among the 14 isolates resistant to bacitracin, 6 isolates of s. pyogenes, 6 isolates of s. constellatus, and 2 isolates of s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were identified. all isolates were sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin. one isolate ofs. pyogenes demonstrated constitutive mlsb resistance mechanism. seven  isolates were resistant to tetracycline: s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (3 isolates), s. constellatus (3), and s. pyogenes (1). the number of isolates resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was as follows: s. pyogenes (6) and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (1), whereas four isolates were resistant to ofloxacin. conclusions: the bacitracin test cannot be used as the only test for the laboratory identification of s. pyogenes even if it is combined with the determination of the lancefield group antigen due to the existence of bacitracin  resistant s. pyogenes strains. therefore, it is necessary to perform biochemical  commercial tests in addition to routine phenotypic tests. isolation of beta-hemolysing streptococci other than s. pyogenes from patients with pharyngitis confirms their role in the etiology of this infection. taken into account the significance of determination of sensitivity to bacitracin for the preliminary identification of s. pyogenes, it is necessary to standardize this test, which will make obtaining of the comparability of results possible.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == acute glomerulonephritis associated with streptococcus pyogenes with concomitant  spread of streptococcus constellatus in four rural families.
AB  == we studied history, renal histopathology and microbiology of an epidemic of acute glomerulonephritis associated with throat infections and uncommon culture results in four neighbour families. a 40-year-old man (index patient) was referred to a university hospital for dialysis and kidney biopsy due to a suspected acute glomerulonephritis. an acute tonsillitis had preceded the condition. penicillin treatment had been started four days before the discovery of renal failure. throat swabs were positive for beta-hemolytic streptococci, group c (gcs). gcs were also found in throat cultures from his wife and two of their children. the bacteria were typed as streptococcus constellatus. a third child had s. constellatus expressing lancefield antigen group g. a neighbour and two of his children fell ill the following week with renal involvement. throat swabs from both these children were positive for s. constellatus. his third child had erythema multiforme and s. constellatus in the throat while a fourth child had beta-hemolytic streptococci group a; streptococcus pyogenes. kidney biopsies on the index patient and his neighbour showed an acute diffuse prolipherative glomerulonephritis compatible with acute post-streptococcal nephritis and microbiological analysis of renal tissue revealed in both cases s. pyogenes and s. constellatus. the families had had much contact and had consumed unpasteurized milk from our index patient's farm. in four of seven persons in two additional neighbouring families s. constellatus was found in throat swabs during the same month while two persons carried streptococcus anginosus expressing the lancefield c antigen. in conclusion spread of s. constellatus coincided with the occurrence  of four cases of acute glomerulonephritis. the two biopsied patients had both s.  pyogenes and s. constellatus present in renal tissue. the epidemic either suggested that the outbreak of glomerulonephritis was due to s. pyogenes but coincided with the transmission and colonization of s. constellatus or that the s. constellatus strains were highly pathogenic or nephritogenic and that this organism can be transmitted in such cases.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == cross-reactivity between human sialyl lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.
