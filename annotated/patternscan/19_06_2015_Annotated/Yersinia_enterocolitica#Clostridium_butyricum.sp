TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food
