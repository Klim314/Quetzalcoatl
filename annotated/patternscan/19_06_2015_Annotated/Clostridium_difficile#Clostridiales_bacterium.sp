TI  == identification, immunogenicity, and cross-reactivity of type iv pilin and pilin-like proteins from clostridium difficile.
AB  == the gram-positive anaerobe clostridium difficile is the major cause of nosocomial diarrhea; manifestations of infection include diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and death. genes for type iv pili, a bacterial nanofiber often involved in colonization and until relatively recently described only in gram-negatives, are  present in all members of the clostridiales. we hypothesized that any pilins encoded in the c. difficile genome would be immunogenic, as has been shown with pilins from gram-negative organisms. we describe nine pilin or pilin-like protein genes, for which we introduce a coherent nomenclature, in the c. difficile r20291 genome. the nine predicted pilin or pilin-like proteins have relatively conserved n-terminal hydrophobic regions, but diverge at their c-termini. analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions revealed evidence of diversifying selective pressure in two pilin genes. six of the nine identified proteins were purified and used to immunize mice. immunization of mice with each individual protein generated antibody responses that varied in titer and cross-reactivity, a notable result given the low amino acid sequence identity among the pilins. further studies in other small mammals mirrored our results in mice. our results  illuminate components of the c. difficile type iv pilus and help identify targets for an anti-c. difficile vaccine.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.
AB  == fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is becoming a more widely used technology  for treatment of recurrent clostridum difficile infection (cdi). while previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for fmt, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat cdi. here we report that high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following fmt using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. post fmt samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. proteobacteria and actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to fmt. post fmt samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of  members of the families bacteroidaceae, rikenellaceae and porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of bacteroides, alistipes and parabacteroides genera. members of the phylum firmicutes were represented by ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified clostridiales and members of the firmicutes. one patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal proteobacteria, primarily enterobacteriaceae. our results demonstrate that frozen fecal microbiota from a healthy donor can be used to effectively treat recurrent cdi resulting in restoration of the structure of gut microbiota and clearing of clostridum difficile.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.
