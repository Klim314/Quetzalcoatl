TI  == root-associated bacterial endophytes from ralstonia solanacearum resistant and susceptible tomato cultivars and their pathogen antagonistic effects.
AB  == this study was undertaken to assess if the root-associated native bacterial endophytes in tomato have any bearing in governing the host resistance to the wilt pathogen ralstonia solanacearum. internal colonization of roots by bacterial endophytes was confirmed through confocal imaging after syto-9 staining. endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized roots of 4-weeks-old seedlings of known wilt resistant (r) tomato cultivar arka abha and susceptible (s) cv. arka vikas on nutrient agar after plating the tissue homogenate. arka abha displayed more diversity with nine distinct organisms while arka vikas showed five species with two common organisms (pseudomonas oleovorans and agrobacterium  tumefaciens). screening for general indicators of biocontrol potential showed more isolates from arka abha positive for siderophore, hcn and antibiotic biosynthesis than from arka vikas. direct challenge against the pathogen indicated strong antagonism by three arka abha isolates (p. oleovorans, pantoea ananatis, and enterobacter cloacae) and moderate activity by three others, while  just one isolate from arka vikas (p. oleovorans) showed strong antagonism. validation for the presence of bacterial endophytes on three r cultivars (arka alok, arka ananya, arka samrat) showed 8-9 antagonistic bacteria in them in comparison with four species in the three s cultivars (arka ashish, arka meghali, arka saurabhav). altogether 34 isolates belonging to five classes, 16 genera and  27 species with 23 of them exhibiting pathogen antagonism were isolated from the  four r cultivars against 17 isolates under three classes, seven genera and 13 species from the four s cultivars with eight isolates displaying antagonistic effects. the prevalence of higher endophytic bacterial diversity and more antagonistic organisms associated with the seedling roots of resistant cultivars  over susceptible genotypes suggest a possible role by the root-associated endophytes in natural defense against the pathogen.

TI  == oem--a new medium for rapid isolation of onion-pathogenic and onion-associated bacteria.
AB  == onions (allium cepa l.) are plagued by a number of bacterial pathogens including  pantoea ananatis, p. agglomerans, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter cloacae, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. axonopodis and several pseudomonas spp. we developed a semi-selective medium, termed onion extract medium (oem), to selectively and rapidly isolate bacteria pathogenic to and associated with onions and onion-related samples including bulbs, seeds, sets, transplant seedlings, soil and water. most strains of interest grow sufficiently on oem in 24h at 28 degrees c for tentative identification based on colony morphology, facilitating further characterization  by microbiological and/or molecular means.

TI  == papaya shoot tip associated endophytic bacteria isolated from in vitro cultures and host-endophyte interaction in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == fourteen distinct bacterial clones were isolated from surface-sterilized shoot tips (approximately 1 cm) of papaya (carica papaya l. 'surya') planted on murashige and skoog (ms)-based papaya culture medium (23/50 nos.) during the 2-4  week period following in vitro culturing. these isolates were ascribed to six gram-negative genera, namely pantoea (p. ananatis), enterobacter (e. cloacae), brevundimonas (b. aurantiaca), sphingomonas, methylobacterium (m. rhodesianum), and agrobacterium (a. tumefaciens) or two gram-positive genera, microbacterium (m. esteraromaticum) and bacillus (b. benzoevorans) based on 16s rdna sequence analysis. pantoea ananatis was the most frequently isolated organism (70% of the  cultures) followed by b. benzoevorans (13%), while others were isolated from single stocks. bacteria-harboring in vitro cultures often showed a single organism. pantoea, enterobacter, and agrobacterium spp. grew actively on ms-based normal papaya medium, while microbacterium, brevundimonas, bacillus, sphingomonas, and methylobacterium spp. failed to grow in the absence of host tissue. supplying ms medium with tissue extract enhanced the growth of all the organisms in a dose-dependent manner, indicating reliance of the endophyte on its host. inoculation of papaya seeds with the endophytes (20 h at od550=0.5) led to  delayed germination or slow seedling growth initially. however, the inhibition was overcome by 3 months and the seedlings inoculated with pantoea, microbacterium, or sphingomonas spp. displayed significantly better root and shoot growths.

TI  == biological control of an insect pest by gut-colonizing enterobacter cloacae transformed with ice nucleation gene.
AB  == the ice nucleation (in) gene inaa of epiphytic erwinia (pantoea) ananas in10 was  transformed into enterobacter cloacae wbmh-3-cmr originated from the faeces of silkworms. the transformant designated as ent. cloacae wbmh-3-cmr(pice6s13) exhibited in activity, unlike the parent strain. the transgenic strain was ingested by mulberry pyralid larvae, fed on detached mulberry leaves, and the supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of these larvae were examined. the mean  supercooling point (scp) of the larvae ingesting the transgenic strain was - 3.3  degrees c, 8 degrees c higher than that of larvae treated with distilled water (control) and 1.5 c higher than an ice nucleation active (ina) strain of erw. ananas. the scps of the larvae were stably maintained over the 9 d after ingestion. the maintenance of these high scps was due to transgenic ent. cloacae  having a more stable and efficient gut colonization than erw. ananas, which is identified by the distribution of a narrower range of scps (-2 to -5 degrees c) in larvae treated with the transgenic stain. furthermore, most of the larvae ingesting the transgenic strain froze and died when they were exposed to cold conditions of -5 degrees c for 18 h, 3 or 7 d after ingestion. in contrast, most  of the larvae ingesting no bacterium did not die under similar conditions. on the other hand, the growth ability of ent. cloacae wbmh-3-cmr on mulberry leaves tended to be lower than that of epiphytic erw. ananas, as assayed by pot tests. these findings would expand the possibility of biological control using ina bacteria since ent. cloacae would harbour a broader host (insect) range for gut colonization and a smaller affinity to plants to benefit from prevention of plant frost injury.
