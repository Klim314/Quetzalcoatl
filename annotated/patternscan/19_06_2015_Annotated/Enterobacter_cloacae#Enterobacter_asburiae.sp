TI  == plant growth promoting bacteria enterobacter asburiae jas5 and enterobacter cloacae jas7 in mineralization of endosulfan.
AB  == endosulfan and their metabolites can be detected in soils with a history of endosulfan application. microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove toxicants, and in this study, enterobacter asburiae jas5 and enterobacter  cloacae jas7 were isolated through enrichment technique. the biodegradation of endosulfan and its metabolites rate constant (k) and dt50 were determined through first-order kinetic models. e. asburiae jas5 degraded the endosulfan, and its metabolites in liquid medium was characterized by the k which was 0.382 day(-1) (alpha-endosulfan), 0.284 day(-1) (beta-endosulfan) and 0.228 day(-1) (endosulfan sulphate), and dt50 was 1.8 day (alpha-endosulfan), 2.4 days (beta-endosulfan) and 3.0 days (endosulfan sulphate). the alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate metabolites were present in the liquid medium that was degraded by e. cloacae jas7 which was characterized by the k of 0.391, 0.297 day(-1) and 0.273 day(-1), and dt50 was 1.7, 2.3 and 2.5 days, respectively. the  infrared spectrum of endosulfan degraded sample in the aqueous medium by e. asburiae jas5 and e. cloacae jas7 showed a band at 1402 cm(-1) which is the characteristics of cooh group. e. asburiae jas5 and e. cloacae jas7 strains also  showed the ability of plant growth promoting traits such as indole-3-acetic acid  (iaa) production, organic acids production and solubilization of various inorganic phosphates. e. asburiae jas5 solubilized 324 +/- 2 mug ml(-1) of tricalcium phosphate, 296 +/- 6 mug ml(-1) of dicalcium phosphate and 248 +/- 5 mug ml(-1) of zinc phosphate, whereas e. cloacae jas7 solubilized 338 +/- 5, 306  +/- 4 and 268 +/- 3 mug ml(-1) of tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate and zinc phosphate, respectively. the iaa production by jas5 and jas7 strains were estimated to be 38.6 +/- 0.3 and 46.6 +/- 0.5 mug ml(-1), respectively. these bacterial strains form a potential candidate for bioremediation of pesticide-contaminated agricultural fields. in addition, it has been demonstrated that the development of powder formulation has several advantages including high  cell count, longer shelf life, greater protection against environmental stresses  and increased field efficacy.

TI  == biomineralization and formulation of endosulfan degrading bacterial and fungal consortiums.
AB  == microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove toxicants and in this study, a microbial consortium consisting of bacterial strains and fungal strains were originally obtained from endosulfan contaminated agricultural soils. identification of the bacterial isolates by 16s rrna sequences revealed the isolates to be halophilic bacterium jas4, klebsiella pneumoniae jas8, enterobacter asburiae jas5, and enterobacter cloacae jas7, whereas the fungal isolates were identified by 18s rrna sequences and the isolates were botryosphaeria laricina jas6, aspergillus tamarii jas9 and lasiodiplodia sp. jas12. the biodegradation of endosulfan was monitored by using hplc and ftir analysis. the bacterial and fungal consortium could degrade 1000 mg l(-1) of endosulfan efficiently in aqueous medium and in soil. the infrared spectrum of endosulfan degraded samples in the aqueous medium by bacterial and fungal consortium showed bands at 1400 and 950 cm(-1) which are the characteristics of cooh group and acid dimer band respectively. in the present investigation, low cost solid materials such as sawdust, soil, fly ash, molasses and nutrients were  used for the formulation of microbial consortium and to achieve greater multiplication and survival of the microbial strains.

TI  == expansion of esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (st15, st147, st336) and epidemic plasmids (incr, incfiik).
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == enterobacter cloacae complex: clinical impact and emerging antibiotic resistance.
AB  == species of the enterobacter cloacae complex are widely encountered in nature, but they can act as pathogens. the biochemical and molecular studies on e. cloacae have shown genomic heterogeneity, comprising six species: enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterobacter kobei, enterobacter  ludwigii and enterobacter nimipressuralis, e. cloacae and e. hormaechei are the most frequently isolated in human clinical specimens. phenotypic identification of all species belonging to this taxon is usually difficult and not always reliable; therefore, molecular methods are often used. although the e. cloacae complex strains are among the most common enterobacter spp. causing nosocomial bloodstream infections in the last decade, little is known about their virulence-associated properties. by contrast, much has been published on the antibiotic-resistance features of these microorganisms. in fact, they are capable of overproducing ampc beta-lactamases by derepression of a chromosomal gene or by the acquisition of a transferable ampc gene on plasmids conferring the antibiotic resistance. many other resistance determinants that are able to render ineffective almost all antibiotic families have been recently acquired. most studies on antimicrobial susceptibility are focused on e. cloacae, e. hormaechei  and e. asburiae; these studies reported small variations between the species, and the only significant differences had no discriminating features.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == a dual approach employing maldi-tof ms and real-time pcr for fast species identification within the enterobacter cloacae complex.
AB  == a real-time pcr procedure targeting the gene of the molecular cochaperon dnaj (dnaj) was developed for specific detection of strains belonging to the enterobacter cloacae group. the inclusivity and exclusivity of the real-time pcr  assay were assessed with seven reference strains of e. cloacae, 12 other enterobacter species and 41 non-enterobacter strains. inclusivity as well as exclusivity of the duplex real-time pcr was 100%. in contrast, resolution of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) was inadequate for delineation of enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterobacter kobei and enterobacter ludwigii from e. cloacae. eleven of 56 (20%) clinical isolates of the e. cloacae group could not be clearly identified as a certain species using maldi-tof ms. in summary, the combination of maldi-tof ms with the e. cloacae-specific duplex real-time pcr is  an appropriate method for identification of the six species of the e. cloacae complex.

TI  == enterobacter mori sp. nov., associated with bacterial wilt on morus alba l.
AB  == two isolates of mulberry-pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased mulberry roots were investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis combined with rpob gene sequence analysis allocated strains r18-2(t) and r3-3 to the genus enterobacter, with enterobacter asburiae,  e. amnigenus, e. cancerogenus, e. cloacae subsp. cloacae, e. cloacae subsp. dissolvens and e. nimipressuralis as their closest relatives. cells of the isolates were gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods, 0.3-1.0 microm wide and 0.8-2.0 microm long, with peritrichous flagella, showing a dna g+c content of 55.1 +/- 0.5 mol%. calculation of a similarity index based on phenotypic features and fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analysis suggested that these isolates are members of e. cancerogenus or e. asburiae or a closely related species. biochemical data revealed that the isolates could be differentiated from their nearest neighbours by the presence of lysine decarboxylase activity and their ability to utilize d-arabitol. dna-dna relatedness also distinguished the two isolates from phylogenetically closely related enterobacter strains. based on these data, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus enterobacter, named enterobacter mori sp. nov. the type strain is r18-2(t)  ( = cgmcc 1.10322(t) = lmg 25706(t)).

TI  == isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting bacteria from non-rhizospheric soil and their effect on cowpea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp.) seedling growth.
AB  == the efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing enterobacter isolated from  non-rhizospheric soil in western ghat forest in india. plant growth promoting ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. all are gram negative, rod shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees c (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees c). all isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of ph 6-12, optimum at ph 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16s rrna gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to enterobacter aerogenes sp. (nii-0907 and nii-0929), enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (nii-0931) and enterobacter asburiae sp. (nii-0934) with which they share >99% sequence similarity. under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates  were found to produce indole acetic acid, p-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide.  the p-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in ph of the medium (ph 7.0-<3.0). the plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a cow pea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

TI  == molecular identification of coliform bacteria isolated from drinking water reservoirs with traditional methods and the colilert-18 system.
AB  == the accuracy of a traditional method (lactose utilization with acid and gas production) for the detection of coliform bacteria and e. coli was tested in comparison with method iso 9308-1 (based on acid formation from lactose) and the  colilert-18 system (detection of beta-galactosidase). a total of 345 isolates were identified after isolation from water samples using api 20e strips. the colilert-18 led to the highest number of positive findings (95% of the isolates were assigned to coliforms), whereas the iso-9308-1 method resulted only in 29% coliform findings. with the traditional method only 15% were rated positive. most of the isolates were identified by the api 20e system as enterobacter spp. (species of the enterobacter cloacae complex), serratia spp., citrobacter spp.and klebsiella spp.; but species identification remained vague in several cases. a more detailed identification of 126 pure cultures by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and analysis of the hsp60 gene resulted in the identification of enterobacter nimipressuralis, e. amnigenus, e. asburiae, e. hormaechei, and serratia fonticola as predominat coliforms. these species are beta-galactosidase  positive, but show acid formation from lactose often after a prolonged incubation time. they are often not of fecal origin and may interfere with the ability to accurately detect coliforms of fecal origin.

TI  == reassignment of enterobacter dissolvens to enterobacter cloacae as e. cloacae subspecies dissolvens comb. nov. and emended description of enterobacter asburiae and enterobacter kobei.
AB  == the taxonomic position of enterobacter dissolvens was re-evaluated based on the analysis of the type strain atcc 23373t and three clinical isolates. the strains  were assigned to the genetic cluster of the species by phylogenetic sequence analysis in the frame of a recent population genetic study. the relatedness of e. dissolves to the other species of the e. cloacae complex was analyzed by dna-dna  hybridization studies based on melting profiles in microplates. the genetic cluster of e. dissolvens fell into the same dna-relatedness group like e. cloacae with mean deltatm-values of 3.9 degrees c confirming the hybridization results of three former studies. phenotypic analysis of the e. cloacae and e. dissolvens strains, respectively, based on 115 biochemical reactions yielded the esculin test as the only one differentiating between them by being positive for e. dissolvens and negative for e. cloacae strains. the name e. cloacae subsp. dissolvens comb. nov. is proposed for the group of organisms formerly referred to as e. dissolvens, and the name e. cloacae subsp. cloacae comb. nov. for the group of organisms formerly referred to as e. cloacae. the species descriptions of enterobacter kobei and enterobacter asburiae were emended based on the data collected on 17 and 15 strains, respectively. the strains were assigned to the respective species by a combination of phylogenetic sequence analyzes and dna-dna hybridizations. phenotypic analyzes of 115 reactions gave detailed species profiles with new differentiating phenotypic properties.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae, u.s. rivers.
AB  == our study was initiated by previous isolation of 30 imipenem-resistant, gram-negative rods from 7 of 16 u.s. rivers sampled from 1999 to 2001. imipenem hydrolysis was detected in 22 of those isolates identified as enterobacter asburiae. random amplified polymorphism dna analysis showed that these e. asburiae isolates were genetically indistinguishable. an identical clavulanic acid-inhibited beta-lactamase imi-2 was identified from each isolate that shared  99% and 97% amino acid identity with the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases imi-1 and nmca, respectively, from e. cloacae clinical isolates. the blaimi-2 gene was  located on a self-transferable 66-kb plasmid. sequence analysis of a cloned 5.5-kb dna fragment obtained from 1 of the imipenem-resistant e. asburiae isolates identified an upstream lysr-type regulator gene that explained inducibility of imi-2 expression. beta-lactamase imi-2 is the first inducible and plasmid-encoded carbapenemase. identification of clonally related e. asburiae isolates from distant rivers indicates an environmental and enterobacterial reservoir for carbapenemase genes.

TI  == incidence of antibiotic-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter species  in freshwater wetlands.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to assess the incidence of enterobacteriaceae (potential human and animal pathogens) in wetlands. methods: enterobacteriaceae,  selected from the sediments and rhizosphere of wetland plant juncus effusus l., were analysed using classical microbiological methods, api20e, api20ne, fatty acid analyses, and 16s rrna sequencing. assessed virulence factors include antibiotic resistance, presence of plasmids and capsules. results: klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter asburiae, known human pathogens, were identified. k. pneumoniae 16s rrna gene sequence showed the significant hit (e < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from faeces of elderly individuals (accession number ab099804) when genbank database was used. ent. asburiae 16s rrna gene sequence showed the significant hit with (e < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from the pig gastrointestinal tract (accession number af371852). the rate of antibiotic resistance (<50 microg  ml(-1)) was high for ampicillin and cephalosporins for the most strains (75.7%) yet low (>10 to 20 microg ml(-1)) for kanamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol for all strains tested. capsules were detected in all investigated strains. pcr detected membrane protein but not chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase. significance and impact of the study: the antibiotic resistance of tested strains and presence of capsules (protect micro-organisms from phagocytosis) suggest that wetland sediments and rhizosphere present a potential reservoirs for enteric human and animal pathogens.

TI  == identification of enterobacter bacteria as saxitoxin producers in cattle's rumen  and surface water from venezuelan savannahs.
AB  == we have previously shown that a paralytic toxin able to block sodium channels in  nerve is associated with a cattle disease known as bovine paraplegic syndrome (bps) [toxicon. 31 (1993) 1581]. we have now identified this as saxitoxin (stx) using hplc by either the methods of [toxicon. 31 (1993) 1581], or [toxicon. 25 (1987) 1105]. in recent experiments we were able to collect and cultivate facultative anaerobic bacteria growing on rumen, grass and ponds of corrals with  high incidence of bps; the cultured bacteria produce compounds indistinguishable  from stx under both hplc procedures described above. two species of the enterobacter genus (e. asburiae and e. cloacae) and a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, were identified using standard biochemical criteria as well as gas chromatography of bacterial lipids. all these bacteria produced stx in aerobic cultures.

TI  == population genetics of the nomenspecies enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the genetic heterogeneity of the nomenspecies enterobacter cloacae is well known. enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei, enterobacter kobei, and enterobacter nimipressuralis are closely related to it and are subsumed in the so-called e. cloacae complex. dna-dna hybridization studies performed previously identified at least five dna-relatedness groups of this complex. in order to analyze the genetic structure and the phylogenetic relationships between the clusters of the nomenspecies e. cloacae, 206 strains collected from 22 hospitals, a veterinarian, and an agricultural center in 11 countries plus all 13 type strains of the genus and reference strain cdc 1347-71(r) were examined with a combination of sequence and  pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analyses of the three housekeeping genes hsp60, rpob, and hemb as well as ampc, the gene of a class c beta-lactamase. based on the neighbor-joining tree of the hsp60 sequences, 12 genetic clusters (i to xii) and an unstable sequence crowd (xiii) were identified. the robustness of the genetic clusters was confirmed by analyses of rpob and hemb sequences and ampc pcr-rflps. sequence crowd xiii split into two groups after rpob analysis. only three strains formed a cluster with the type strain of e. cloacae, indicating that the minority of isolates identified as e. cloacae truly belong to the species; 13% of strains grouped with other type strains of the genus, suggesting that the phenotypes of these species seem to be  more heterogeneous than so far believed. three clusters represented 70% of strains, but none of them included a type or reference strain. the genetic clustering presented in this study might serve as a framework for future studies  dealing with taxonomic, evolutionary, epidemiological, or pathogenetic characteristics of bacteria belonging to the e. cloacae complex.

TI  == chromosomal ampc genes in enterobacter species other than enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the act-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to enterobacter asburiae.
AB  == the amplification and sequence of ampc genes in enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei and enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus enterobacter to seven. expression in escherichia coli of the ampc  genes from e. asburiae, e. hormaechei and e. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampc from e. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(act-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from enterobacter cloacae. the reassignment of act-1 ancestry to e. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampr upstream of bla(act-1) and ampr from e. asburiae.

AB  == traditional ways of identification of bacteria by phenotypic characteristics cannot be used for non-cultivable organisms and organisms with unusual biochemical profiles. in this study, an enterobacteriaceae was isolated in pure growth from the mid-stream urine of a 67-year old renal transplant recipient with urinary tract infection. conventional biochemical tests did not reveal a pattern  resembling any known member of the enterobacteriaceae family. the vitek system (gni+) showed that it was 18% leclercia adecarboxylata and 55% klebsiella ozaenae; whereas the api system (20e) showed that it was 99.8% rahnella aquatilis. 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing showed that there was 7 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter cloacae, 18 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter asburiae, 17 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter cancerogenus, 35 base differences between the isolate and k. ozaenae, 27 base differences between the isolate and l. adecarboxylata, and 72 base differences between the isolate and r. aquatilis, indicating that the isolate most closely resembled a strain of e. cloacae. identification of the organism in this study is important, as the choice of antibiotics would be radically different. in this case, cephalosporins should be avoided regardless of in-vitro susceptibility as cephalosporins are well-known to select for ampc derepressed mutants in enterobacter, and previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins is more likely to be associated with multidrug resistant enterobacter isolates than is administration of antibiotics that do not include a third-generation cephalosporin.

TI  == treatment of sanitary-important bacteria by bacteriocin substance v24 in cattle dung water.
AB  == quantification of sanitary-important bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae), as well  as indicators of environmental contamination, was assessed in samples of cattle dung from 25 cattle farms in 15 north-eastern slovakia districts. the inhibitory  effect of crude bacteriocin extract cbe v24 from enterococcus faecalis v24 against listeria monocytogenes ohio and yersinia enterocolitica ye85 was examined in cattle dung water with the aim of finding a new way of eliminating the health  risk of the animal slurry. the following bacterial groups were quantified: salmonella spp., shigella-like spp. , proteus spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., pseudomonas spp. , escherichia coli, listeria spp., staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci (the average count ranged from 102 up to 104 cfu ml-1). antagonistic effect of the crude bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis v24 in the range of 100-600 arbitrary units per ml (au ml-1) was shown against the following bacteria: enterobacter cloacae, ent. asburiae, proteus spp., salmonella spp., acinetobacter lwoffi, l. monocytogenes as well as y. enterocolitica ye85. during tests performed to study the inhibitory effect of the crude bacteriocin cbe v24 (concentration 800, 1600 au ml-1) against l. monocytogenes ohio and y. enterocolitica ye85 in experimentally contaminated cattle dung, a reduction of 2.03 and 1.44 log cfu ml-1, respectively, was already noted after 1 h after crude bacteriocin cbe v24 addition.

TI  == beta-lactamases and detection of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacter spp.
AB  == enterobacter spp. are becoming increasingly frequent nosocomial pathogens, and beta-lactam-resistant strains are on the increase, especially among isolates recovered from intensive care units. therefore, a study was designed to characterize the beta-lactamases produced by 80 isolates of e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, e. taylorae, e. gergoviae, e. sakazakii, e. asburiae, and e. agglomerans by induction studies, spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays, and isoelectric focusing. the ability of broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests to detect resistance to 16 beta-lactam antibiotics among these species was also assessed. all species except e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, and some isolates of e. sakazakii were found to produce a bush group 1 cephalosporinase that was expressed inducibly or constitutively at high levels. in addition, some strains also produced a bush group 2 beta-lactamase. in comparisons of broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests, disk diffusion tests failed to detect resistance in 1 of 25 isolates resistant to aztreonam and 2 of 30 isolates resistant to ceftazidime. these results indicate that species of enterobacter can possess a variety of beta-lactamases that are responsible for beta-lactam resistance in this genus and that the disk diffusion test may occasionally miss resistance in some strains.

TI  == enterobacter asburiae sp. nov., a new species found in clinical specimens, and reassignment of erwinia dissolvens and erwinia nimipressuralis to the genus enterobacter as enterobacter dissolvens comb. nov. and enterobacter nimipressuralis comb. nov.
AB  == enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. is a new species that was formerly referred to as  enteric group 17 and that consists of 71 strains, 70 of which were isolated from  humans. enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains gave positive reactions in tests for methyl red, citrate utilization (simmons and christensen's), urea hydrolysis, l-ornithine decarboxylase, growth in kcn, acid and gas production from d-glucose, and acid production from l-arabinose, cellobiose, glycerol (negative in 1 to 2 days, positive in 3 to 7 days), lactose, d-mannitol, alpha-methyl-d-glucoside, salicin, d-sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and d-xylose. they gave negative reactions in the voges-proskauer test and in tests for indole, h2s production, phenylalanine, l-lysine decarboxylase, motility, gelatin, utilization of malonate, lipase, dnase, tyrosine clearing, acid production from adonitol, d-arabitol, dulcitol, erythritol, i(myo)-inositol, melibiose, and l-rhamnose. they gave variable reactions in tests for l-arginine dihydrolase (25% positive after 2 days) and acid production from raffinose (69% positive after 2 days). thirty-four enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains were tested for dna relatedness by the hydroxyapatite method with 32po4-labeled dna from the designated type strain (1497-78, atcc 35953). the strains were 69 to 100% related in 60 degrees c reactions and 63 to 100% related in 75 degrees c reactions. divergence within related sequences was 0 to 2.5%. relatedness of enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. to 84 strains of members of the enterobacteriaceae was 5 to 63%, with closest relatedness to strains of enterobacter cloacae, erwinia dissolvens, enterobacter taylorae, enterobacter agglomerans, erwinia nimipressuralis, and enterobacter gergoviae. all strains tested were susceptible  to gentamicin and sulfdiazine, and most were susceptible to chloramphenicol, colistin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, carbenicillin and streptomycin. all strains  were resistant to ampicillan, cephalothin, and penicillin, and most were resistant or moderately resistant to tetracycline. enterobacter asburiae sp. nov  strains were isolated from a variety of human sources, most prevalent of which were urine (16 strains), respiratory sources (15 strains), stools (12 strains), wounds (11 strains), and blood (7 strains). the clinical significance of enterobacter aburiae is not known. as a result of this and previous studies, proposals are made to transfer erwinia dissolvens and erwinia nimipressuralis to  the genus enterobacter as enterobacter dissolvens comb. nov. and enterobacter nimipressuralis comb. nov., respectively.
