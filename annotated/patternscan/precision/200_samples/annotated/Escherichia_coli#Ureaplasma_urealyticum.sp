TI == conversion of a chaperonin groel-independent protein into an obligate substrate.
AB == chaperones assist protein folding by preventing unproductive protein aggregation  in the cell. in escherichia coli, chaperonin groel/groes (groe) is the only indispensable chaperone and is absolutely required for the de novo folding of at least approximately 60 proteins. we previously found that several orthologs of the obligate groe substrates in ureaplasma urealyticum, which lacks the groe gene in the genome, are e. coli groe-independent folders, despite their significant sequence identities. here, we investigated the key features that define the groe dependence. chimera or random mutagenesis analyses revealed that independent multiple point mutations, and even single mutations, were sufficient to confer groe dependence on the ureaplasma metk. strikingly, the groe dependence was well correlated with the propensity to form protein aggregates during folding. the results reveal the delicate balance between groe dependence and independence. the function of groe to buffering the aggregation-prone mutations plays a role in maintaining higher genetic diversity of proteins.

TI == vaginal infections among pregnant women at omdurman maternity hospital in khartoum, sudan.
AB == introduction: microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. this study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. methodology: a cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between august and december 2008 at omdurman maternity hospital, khartoum, sudan. vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct gram smear, nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. statistical analysis was done using spss program version 12.0.1. a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, bv was detected in 49.8%, followed by chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). no significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and c. trachomatis infections was found. gentamicin was the most active agent against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. clarythromycin was the most active against mycoplasma species. conclusions: pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. such cases may require specific medication. routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.

TI == antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
AB == objective: to assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending saint camille medical centre in ouagadougou. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. results: the results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. candida albicans (48.76%), followed by escherichia coli (16.67%), streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. the antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. however, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. conclusions: the results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. efforts should be made to address these points in the country.

TI == antimicrobial activity and molecular mechanism of the cres protein.
AB == cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic (cres) protein, a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors (also known as cst8), exhibits highly specific, age-dependent expression in mouse testis and epididymis. the cres protein possesses four highly conserved cysteine residues which govern the overall conformation of the cystatins through the formation of two disulfide bonds. previous studies have revealed that other cystatin family members, such as cystatin 3 and cystatin 11, show antibacterial activity in vitro. this prompted us to investigate the potential antimicrobial activity of the cres protein. colony forming assays and spectrophotometry were used to investigate the effects of recombinant cres protein on escherichia coli (e. coli) and ureaplasma urealyticum (uu), respectively, in vitro. after incubation of e. coli with cres recombinant protein fused with glutathione-s-transferase (gst), a substantial decrease in colony forming units was observed, and the effect was dose and time dependent. furthermore, it took longer for uu to grow to plateau stage when incubated with gst-cres recombinant protein compared with the control gst. the antibacterial and anti-uu activities were not impaired when the cysteine residues of cres protein were mutated, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was not dependent on its disulfide bonds. functional analysis of three cres polypeptides showed that the n-terminal 30 residues (n30) had no antimicrobial activity while n60 showed similar activity as full-length cres protein. these results suggest that the active center of cres protein resides between amino acid residues 31 and 60 of its n-terminus. mechanistically, e. coli membrane permeabilization was increased in a dose-dependent manner, and macromolecular synthesis was inhibited on treatment with gst-cres. together, our data on the antimicrobial activities of cres protein suggest that it is a novel and innate antimicrobial protein which protecting the male reproductive tract against invading pathogens.

TI == amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB == spontaneous preterm birth (ptb) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pprom) occur more frequently in african-american women than in other racial groups. this may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the condition. it is also possible that amniotic fluid (af) has different immunomodulatory properties in african-american women that increase their risk of ptb and pprom. to test this, we cultured fetal membranes from european-american and african-american women with sterile medium (control), escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococci (gbs), polyporphorans gingivalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum or ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous af. cytokine concentrations were quantified in the conditioned medium. all bacterial species increased il-8 production. il-1beta and tnf-alpha production were stimulated by lps, e. coli, and g. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to group b streptococci and p. gingivalis were limited to il-1beta and tnf-alpha respectively. genital mycoplasmas stimulated tnf-alpha and il-10 but had no effect on il-1beta production. african-americans had twice the il-1beta response to e. coli as european-americans (p=0.031). conversely, european-americans produced more il-8 in response to lps than african-americans (p=0.026). af had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. these results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. interventions to prevent ptb and pprom may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her af.

TI == bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane toll-like receptor expression.
AB == problem: preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (ptb) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection and inflammation. the membranes may sense and respond to microbes via toll-like receptors (tlrs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation in this tissue. the objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of tlrs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and ptb. method of study: normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. after 24 hrs, rna was extracted and quantitative rt-pcr performed for tlrs1-10. results: treatment of fetal membranes with mycoplasma hominis increased expression of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr8 mrna. ureaplasma parvum upregulated tlr8 mrna, and porphyromonas gingivalis significantly increased fetal membrane tlr7 expression. in contrast, treatment with gram-negative escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated tlr10 mrna. no effect was detected for ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, or group b streptococcus. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane tlr expression patterns. moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pprom and ptb, arise.

TI == preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB == objective: to compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. methods: fetal membranes were obtained after cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-2, il-4, il-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6, il-8, il-1beta and tnf-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp-1, mmp-2, mmp-3, mmp-7, mmp-8, mmp-9) were measured in the supernatants using bio-plex, and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). microorganisms isolated were ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group b streptococci (3), gardnerella vaginalis (1), and escherichia coli (2). we found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. secretion of mmp-1, mmp-8, mmp-9 and pge(2) was significantly higher in infected women. secretion of il-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. conclusions: almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.

TI == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

TI == an intrauterine device as a possible cause of change in the microbial flora of the female genital system.
AB == aim: an intrauterine device (iud), used by millions of women worldwide, is one of the most efficient methods of contraception. the goal of our study was to compare a group of women using the iud to a control group. material & methods: the survey included 236 women of fertile age from gynaecological practices in the area of split and dalmatia county, croatia. the subjects were divided into two groups: iud users and a control group (women not using any contraception methods). sampling, transportation, sample processing in the laboratory and interpretation of results were conducted using standard microbiological procedures and methods. results: opportunistic bacteria were statistically more frequently isolated among iud users (p < 0.001). the most frequently isolated bacteria in both groups were escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum with significantly higher rates in iud users (p < 0.001). both colonization and infection had higher rates in iud users (p < 0.001). there were no significant differences either in the frequency of bacteria isolation regarding different iud types (p = 0.93), or in relation to duration of iud use (p = 0.67). conclusions: based on the data in our study iud users have an increased chance of developing a cervical infection caused by the bacteria escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum. therefore, before iud insertion women should be screened and treated for asymptomatic vaginal or cervical infections to prevent possible serious iud-associated infections.

TI == bacterial species present in the lower male genital tract: a five-year retrospective study.
AB == objectives: to identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. methods: the microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. results: semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by escherichia coli and enterococcus sp. ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and g. vaginalis isolation. semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species isolated most frequently. in comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of g. vaginalis and u. urealyticum. conclusions: positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.

TI == [can introduction of guidelines for use of an intrauterine device reduce changes  in microbial flora of female genital system in iud-users?].
AB == the intrauterine device (iud), one of the most effective and most common methods  of reversible contraception, is used by millions of women worldwide. although various studies indicate the benefits of its use as a contraceptive method, the greatest concern regarding iuds is the potential risk for infection. the presence of the iud gives a solid surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. infections due to biofilm formation are chronic and difficult to resolve. however, women should be screened and treated for asymptomatic vaginal or cervical infections before iud insertion. based on the data in the literature and the data in study conducted in croatia, it can be concluded that iud users are at increased risk for development of infection. treatment strategies in croatia should take into consideration that escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum are dominant causative agents. we conclude that guidelines for the use of iud in croatia are a necessity.

TI == cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with a history of preterm birth.
AB == preterm birth is associated with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfalpha at the maternal-fetal interface. previous studies have suggested that women with a history of preterm birth produce aberrantly strong inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). however many intrauterine infections in women are associated with pathogens including ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) that contain pro-inflammatory factors other than lps. we evaluated whether peripheral blood leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth produce elevated amounts of tnfalpha upon stimulation with pathogens associated with preterm birth and if pre-treatment with aspirin, an anti-inflammatory medication, decreases the ex vivo production of this cytokine. heat-killed bacteria elicited increased tnfalpha production from leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but no differences in tnfalpha production between leukocytes from women with preterm birth and control women with term birth were detected. in women who consumed aspirin each day for one week, tnfalpha production was increased in leukocytes from control women stimulated with escherichia coli and u. urealyticum, but was reduced or unchanged in leukocytes from women with preterm birth. similar trends were observed for a subset of samples stimulated with u. urealyticum and assayed for il-6, il-10, il-1beta and tnfalpha by bead array. we conclude that leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth do not have elevated pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens, and that reproductive history is associated with different effects of aspirin on pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

TI == vaginal and endocervical microorganisms in symptomatic and asymptomatic non-pregnant females: risk factors and rates of occurrence.
AB == physiological or non-physiological factors may affect the vaginal flora. the occurrence of genital microorganisms in non-pregnant females of all ages was studied, as were the risk factors associated with each microorganism. a retrospective analysis of vaginal and endocervical cultures and wet smears from 27,172 non-pregnant women, between 1996 to 2005, was performed taking into consideration clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. no microorganisms were observed in 55.7% of the individuals studied and 44.3% had positive cultures. there was no microbiological aetiology in 49% of women with genital symptoms. poor hygiene, chemical irritants, sexual behaviour, vaginal blood, birth control type, and/or the lack of an oestrogen effect may have caused the symptoms. the highest occurrence of gram-negative bacteria (p<0.01), mainly escherichia coli, was observed in prepubescent girls. the highest occurrence of candida species (p<0.01) was in women of childbearing age, and of gram-positive bacteria (p<0.01) in menopausal women. adolescents, particularly asymptomatic girls, carried more frequently ureaplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis (p<0.01). hormonal contraception and consistent condom use was protective against bacterial vaginosis and u. urealyticum colonization. users of intrauterine devices had an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis or of contracting u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and candida species. genital complaints were an independent indicator of candida species, gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis.chlamydia trachomatis infections were often asymptomatic. it is concluded that the hormonal milieu and non-physiological factors are major determinants of the vaginal flora. if diagnosis of genital infections is based on symptoms alone and not on culture results, it may be erroneous. sexual abuse should be investigated when a child presents with a sexually transmitted disease.

TI == infection and stillbirth.
AB == infection may cause stillbirth by several mechanisms, including direct infection, placental damage, and severe maternal illness. various organisms have been associated with stillbirth, including many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. in developed countries, between 10% and 25% of stillbirths may be caused by an infection, whereas in developing countries, which have much higher stillbirth rates, the contribution of infection is much greater. in developed countries, ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as escherichia coli, group b streptococci, and ureaplasma urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth. however, in areas where syphilis is prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. the two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. toxoplasma gondii, listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, q fever, and lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. in certain developing countries, the stillbirth rate is high and the infection-related component so great that achieving a substantial reduction in stillbirth should be possible by reducing maternal infections. however, because infection-related stillbirth is uncommon in developed countries, and because those that do occur are caused by a wide variety of organisms, reducing this etiologic component of stillbirth much further will be difficult.

TI == a novel diagnostic tool for detecting neonatal infections using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB == background: in newborns with infections, it is necessary to detect various pathogens rapidly and accurately, because the infections are often fatal when diagnosis is delayed. however, no diagnostic tools that rapidly detect pathogens causing neonatal infectious diseases are available. objectives: to establish a rapid diagnostic tool using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect 8 major pathogens that often cause neonatal infections, including group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and candida albicans, and to validate this tool in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu). methods: one hundred and thirty clinical samples were obtained from newborns with any infectious signs or histories. dna was extracted from these samples and multiplex pcr was performed with a mixture of 8 primer pairs, all designed to amplify pathogenic dna and produce different sizes of amplicons. seventy-seven samples with suspicion of bacterial infections were also examined by bacterial culture to evaluate the accuracy of the multiplex pcr results. results: six of the 8 pathogens could be rapidly detected by our multiplex pcr method, within 3.5-4.5 h. these positive results led us to immediately diagnose and select proper drugs against each pathogen. in comparison with culture results, our test characteristics were as follows: specificity: 93%, negative predictive value: 96%, and concordance rate: 90%. conclusions: we have established and validated a rapid diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens using multiplex pcr, which may be useful for the confirmed diagnosis of neonatal infections in the nicu.

TI == effect of progesterone on proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth.
AB == problem: a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that supplemental progesterone (p4) can prevent preterm birth. although p4 can decrease the production of mediators of inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated macrophages, a majority of infections associated with preterm birth are due to ureaplasma urealyticum, which does not contain lps. therefore, we studied whether p4 could lower the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes stimulated with u. urealyticum. method of study: human monocytes (thp-1 cells) were treated with p4 and then stimulated with heat-killed escherichia coli or u. urealyticum. cytokine concentrations in the conditioned medium were then measured by elisa and relative viability of the cells was assessed colorimetrically. the impact of p4 on interleukin (il)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-8 production was assessed by comparing levels across different p4 dosages and organism concentrations. results: both organisms increased il-1alpha, tnf-alpha and il-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. p4 enhanced the production of il-1beta and il-8, but inhibited tnf-alpha production by monocytes stimulated with either organism. conclusion: p4 modulates cytokine production by e. coli and u. urealyticum-stimulated monocytes in a similar manner and is not strictly immunosuppressive. this suggests that p4 does not prevent preterm birth by simply suppressing bacteria-stimulated cytokine production.

AB == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI == codon evolution is governed by linear formulas.
AB == when nucleotide (g, c, t and a) contents were plotted against each nucleotide, their relationships were clearly expressed by a linear formula, y = alphax + beta in the coding and non-coding regions. this linear relationship was obtained from the complete single-stranded dna. similarly, nucleotide contents at all three codon positions were expressed by linear regression lines based on the content of each nucleotide. in addition, 64 codon usages were also expressed by linear formulas against nucleotide content. thus, the nucleotide content not only in coding sequence but also in non-coding sequence can be expressed by a linear formula, y = alphax + beta, in 145 organisms (112 bacteria, 15 archaea and 18 eukaryotes). based on these results, the ratio of c/t, g/t, c/a or g/a one can essentially estimate all four nucleotide contents in the complete single-stranded dna, and the determination of any ratio of two kinds of nucleotides can essentially estimate four nucleotide contents, nucleotide contents at the three different codon positions and codon distributions at 64 codons in the coding region. the maximum and minimum values of g content were approximately 0.35 and approximately 0.15, respectively, among various organisms examined. codon evolution occurs according to linear formulas between these two values.

TI == low folding propensity and high translation efficiency distinguish in vivo substrates of groel from other escherichia coli proteins.
AB == motivation: theoretical considerations have indicated that the amount of chaperonin groel in escherichia coli cells is sufficient to fold only approximately 2-5% of newly synthesized proteins under normal physiological conditions, thereby suggesting that only a subset of e.coli proteins fold in vivo in a groel-dependent manner. recently, members of this subset were identified in two independent studies that resulted in two partially overlapping lists of groel-interacting proteins. the objective of the work described here was to identify sequence-based features of groel-interacting proteins that distinguish them from other e.coli proteins and that may account for their dependence on the chaperonin system. results: our analysis shows that groel-interacting proteins have, on average, low folding propensities and high translation efficiencies. these two properties in combination can increase the risk of aggregation of these proteins and, thus, cause their folding to be chaperonin-dependent. strikingly, we find that these properties are absent in proteins homologous to the e.coli groel-interacting proteins in ureaplasma urealyticum, an organism that lacks a chaperonin system, thereby confirming our conclusions.

AB == cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (k9cath). the full-length cdna sequence of k9cath encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature k9cath peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. synthetic k9cath displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus; mics (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microm, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis; mics 1.25 microm, salmonella serotype enteritidis; mic 0.5 microm, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mic 0.06 microm), and yeast (candida albicans; mic 12.5-50 microm). k9cath demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum (mic 0.06 and 50 microm, respectively). similar to its ovine congener smap-29, k9cath possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and lps binding capacity. k9cath displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. the potency and broad antimicrobial activity of k9cath suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.

TI == bacteria trigger oxygen radical release and sperm lipid peroxidation in in vitro  model of semen inflammation.
AB == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may affect the fertility status.

TI == molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
AB == mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. to investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cdna of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cbd-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. their predicted peptides share identical n-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. the two longer isoforms, cbd-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the c terminus. to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cbd, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus; mics of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mics of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (candida albicans; mic of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and u. canigenitalium (mic of 200 mug/ml). antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mm. all three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. in situ hybridization indicated that cbd-1 was expressed primarily in sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. in contrast, cbd-2 was located primarily within leydig cells. the longest isoform, cbd-3, was detected in sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. the tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.

TI == the infectious origins of stillbirth.
AB == objective: our objective was to determine the relationship between various types  of perinatal infections and stillbirths. study design: by use of various textbooks on perinatal infections, multiple medline searches, and the reference list of all appropriate manuscripts, the appropriate english language literature was reviewed to define the relationship between various perinatal infections and stillbirths. results: infection may cause stillbirth by a number of mechanisms, including direct infection, placental damage, and severe maternal illness. a large variety of organisms have been associated with stillbirth, including many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. in developed countries, between 10% and 25% of stillbirths may be caused by an infection, whereas in developing countries, which often have much higher stillbirth rates, the contribution of infection is much greater. ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as escherichia coli, group b streptococci, and ureaplasma urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth. however, in areas where syphilis is very prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. the two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. toxoplasma gondii, leptospirosis, listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, q fever, and lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. conclusion: because infection-related stillbirth is relatively rare in developed countries, and those that do occur are caused by a wide variety of organisms, reducing this etiologic component of stillbirth much further will be difficult. however, in certain developing countries, the stillbirth rate is so high and the infection-related component so great that achieving a substantial reduction in stillbirth should be possible simply by reducing maternal infections.

AB == multigen technology (t. vinayagamoorthy, u.s. patent 6,197,510, march 2001) is a  modification of conventional sequencing technology that generates a single electropherogram consisting of short nucleotide sequences from a mixture of known dna targets. the target sequences may be present on the same or different nucleic acid molecules. for example, when two dna targets are sequenced, the first and second sequencing primers are annealed to their respective target sequences, and then a polymerase causes chain extension by the addition of new deoxyribose nucleotides. since the electrophoretic separation depends on the relative molecular weights of the truncated molecules, the molecular weight of the second sequencing primer was specifically designed to be higher than the combined molecular weight of the first sequencing primer plus the molecular weight of the largest truncated molecule generated from the first target sequence. thus, the series of truncated molecules produced by the second sequencing primer will have higher molecular weights than those produced by the first sequencing primer. hence, the truncated molecules produced by these two sequencing primers can be effectively separated in a single lane by standard gel electrophoresis in a single electropherogram without any overlapping of the nucleotide sequences. by using sequencing primers with progressively higher molecular weights, multiple short dna sequences from a variety of targets can be determined simultaneously. we describe here the basic concept of multigen technology and three applications: detection of sexually transmitted pathogens (neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and ureaplasma urealyticum), detection of contaminants in meat samples (coliforms, fecal coliforms, and escherichia coli o157:h7), and detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human n-acetyltransferase (nat1) gene (s. fronhoffs et al., carcinogenesis 22:1405-1412, 2001).

TI == [role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. the participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of uti; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. to gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in uti. methods: a total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low uti were analyzed. samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and mcconkey agar, as well as hbt medium for g. vaginalis, and u9b broth and agar e broth for m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. results. there were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): g. vaginalis (25.7%), u. urealyticum (5.9%), s. agalactiae (3.4%) and m. hominis (2%). uti were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and in diabetic patients. conclusions: microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of uti.

TI == [genital infection and infertility].
AB == background: genital infection is the most important cause of infertility worldwide, affecting not only fallopian tubes but all anatomic urogenital sites, both male and female. methods: we present a randomized,prospective and normalized study about sexually transmitted diseases(std). we include 487 patients, 376 of whom were infertile and the remaining 111 were not and act as control group. results: 47.3% of infertile patients showed at least one infection: 10.7% had chlamydia trachomatis infection, whereas only 0.3% had gonococal infection. we found none syphilis. 12.9% of the patients showed yeast belonging to genus candida, 5% bacterial vaginosis, 3.8% escherichia coli and 0.3% klebsiella pneumoniae. the percentage of isolation of ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis were 23.5% and 4.8%, respectively. we detected antibodies against hepatitis b (any serological marker) in 7.8% of the cases. chlamydial infection and the presence of u. urealyticum were related with infertility (x 12=6,070, p<0.005 and x12=8,782, p<0.005,respectively). conclusions: we think these results conclude that is necessary to perform routine tests to screen for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and for infections caused by micoplasma as well, among infertile patients. these patients must be considered of being at risk of acquiring std, since the percentage of these diseases is higher than the percentage we found among the control group. it is important to insist on prevention and early diagnosis and treatment as a main goal to decrease the number of tubal occlusion and infertile couples.

AB == during the period 1996-1998, cervical swabs of 50 pregnant women with subacute amniotic infection syndrome (ais) and the semen of their consorts were bacteriologically analyzed. in the control group were 50 healthy pregnant women and their consorts too. pathogenic bacteria (the most common were escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum) were isolated from the cervical swab of 50 pregnant patients with ais in 86.0% of them, while in the control group of healthy pregnant women in 28.0%. pathogenic bacteria were present in 70.0% of semen of consorts pregnant women with ais and only in 30.0% of semen of the control group. the congruity of pathogenic bacteria in the cervical swab and semen in the investigated group was 69.2%, while only 35.7% in the control group. following erythromycin, cefuroxime and local tetracyclin treatment, the negativization of the cervical swab resulted in 30 pregnant patients with ais, while the colonization persisted in 20 of them. the outcome of pregnancy was significantly better in cases with negativization of the cervical swab: perinatal loss was 6.7%, while in cases with persistent infection it was 55.0%. the authors presume the amniotic infection syndrome should be ascending manifestation of nonspecific vaginitis, which is maintained by the consort's urogenital infection. ais should be classified as a 'sexually-transmitted disease'.

TI == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

AB == the aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. in 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. in this cervical mucus immunoglobulin a concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. a vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. there was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin a concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). the serum levels of immunoglobulins a, a1, a2, m and g do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin a levels nor to gestational age. in normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin a concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin a levels.

TI == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13 as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs, mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.

TI == influence of urogenital infections on sperm functions.
AB == many studies have examined the impact of genital tract infections on male fertility; however, the effect of bacteriospermia on sperm quality is still controversial. bacterial infections are more frequently found in semen samples from asymptomatic infertile patients than in those from fertile men. bacteriospermia is also a common problem of male partners from couples undergoing ivf. therefore, the effects of microorganisms on human sperm acrosome reaction of oocytes have been studied in vitro and in vivo. incubation of spermatozoa with escherichia coli or mycoplasma hominis in vitro resulted in reduced sperm motility and inducibility of acrosome reaction (delta ar) after exposure to calcium ionophore a23187. to show possible effects of e. coli and mycoplasma species on sperm functions in vivo, data from 488 patients were evaluated, in whose ejaculates microbiological examinations and determinations of acrosome reaction after exposure to low temperature had been performed. u. urealyticum and e. coli were found in semen samples from 52 and 31 men, respectively. m. hominis was only present in a minor number of samples and was not included in this study. semen concentrations of e. coli and u. urealyticum ranged between 500-100,000 cfu x ml-1 and 100-80,000 cfu x ml-1. no correlation was found between delta ar and concentration of bacteria (spearman rank correlation coefficient, e. coli: r-0.081, p = 0.6644; u. urealyticum: r = -0.081, p = 0.5698). in 69% of cases with u. urealyticum infection and reduced inducibility of acrosome reaction, this sperm function was normal after antibiotic therapy. however, improvement of acrosomal function may only be due to intra-individual variations of acrosome reaction. while e. coli and mycoplasma species affect sperm functions in vitro, the present data and a review of the literature fail to demonstrate similar effects in vivo.

AB == objective: our purpose was to determine the prevalence of intra-uterine infection in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes and to evaluate the clinical characteristics of women and neonates according to the presence or absence of intrauterine infection. study design: trans-abdominal amniocentesis was performed in 90 consecutive patients admitted with preterm premature rupture of membranes. maternal clinical parameters evaluated included maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, previous preterm birth, urinary tract infection, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval and cesarean rate. neonatal clinical parameters evaluated were gestational age at delivery, birth weight, apgar score, neonatal gender, perinatal death and neonatal sepsis. results: the prevalence of intra-uterine infection was 66.6% (60/90). no differences between patients with intra-uterine infection and those without intra-uterine infection were observed in maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval, cesarean section, neonate's gender, apgar score at 5 min and neonatal sepsis. on the other hand, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and apgar score at 1 min were significantly different between the groups. conclusion: an intra-uterine infection was found in two thirds of women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes. women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes and intra-uterine infection had a lower gestational age at delivery and consequently had a lower neonatal birth weight than those without intra-uterine infection.

TI == a prospective study of cortical scarring in acute febrile pyelonephritis in adults: clinical and bacteriological characteristics.
AB == previous reports have demonstrated lesions on computerized axial tomography (ct), and nuclear scintigraphy (dmsa) in acute pyelonephritis (pn). we undertook a prospective study of all patients presenting to our hospital with pn over 40 months. patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria, were treated with intravenous antibiotics. excluding two who were pregnant, all patients had imaging by intravenous urography (ivu), ct and dmsa during their admission. urine samples were collected prior to treatment. patients without ivu evidence of cortical scarring but with parenchymal defects on ct and/or dmsa underwent a repeat dmsa three or more months after the acute episode. of the 164 patients, 142 were female. e. coli was found in 116 patients. forty-six patients had an abnormality on ivu. of the 106 patients without ivu evidence of cortical scarring, 59 had a defect on ct and/or dmsa. late dmsa scans in 35 of these 59 patients showed a persistent abnormality in 77%. e. coli characteristics such as p-fimbriae and type 1 fimbriae were not predictive of acute imaging abnormalities. inhibition of e. coli growth by the addition of edta was highly predictive of acute ct and dmsa abnormalities with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 82.8%. acute pyelonephritis is often associated with acute ct and/or dmsa abnormalities which may evolve into renal cortical scars. acute scan abnormalities can be predicted by the presence of e. coli which were susceptible to edta in culture. late scarring could not be predicted by clinical features, response to treatment or antibiotic used.

TI == tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 in normal and infected human seminal fluid.
AB == the presence of cytokines such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) and interleukin 2 (il2) in human spermatozoa is still to be defined. the aim of this study was to measure the concentration of both soluble factors in seminal fluid. data from normal semen samples (n = 24) confirmed the presence of il2 (258 +/- 84 fmol/ml corresponding to 953 +/- 369 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) and tnf alpha (62.2 +/- 16.4 fmol/ml corresponding to 231.3 +/- 86 fmol/total volume of ejaculate). a significant positive correlation (r = 0.59; p < 0.01) was observed between the tnf alpha and the il2 concentrations. the concentrations of these cytokines were not related to sperm parameters. in contrast, il2 concentrations (196.9 +/- 60.4 fmol/ml; 686.2 +/- 236.7 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) evaluated in 16 seminal fluids with identified bacterial agents were lower than in the control group, whereas tnf alpha concentrations (68.6 +/- 12.3 fmol/ml; 241.3 +/- 78.9 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) were not significantly different from the controls. further studies are needed to determine the potential role of these cytokines in the physiology of semen and their usefulness as indicators of reproductive pathology.

TI == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI == prostatitis--diagnostic criteria, classification of patients and recommendations  for therapeutic trials.
AB == infections of the prostate may occur despite the numerous host defences of the male urogenital tract. it is important to distinguish patients with genuine inflammation of the gland from the larger number of men with symptoms but no signs of an inflammatory response (prostatodynia). to define prostatitis, the degree of the inflammatory reaction must first be determined. increased numbers of leucocytes in expressed prostatic secrections (eps) are essential for this diagnosis. careful lower urinary tract studies may then be used to classify the patients into two major groups of bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis. chronic bacterial prostatitis is primarily due to escherichia coli. gram-positive prostatitis is debatable. in chronic bacterial prostatitis, secretory dysfunction is common. the increased alkalinity of the ph of expressed prostatic secretions is one of the reasons for poor results of antibiotic therapy. uncommon microorganisms, such as chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum may be involved in some cases of the "nonbacterial" form. routine culture for these microorganisms is not recommended.

TI == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

AB == the effects on the urinary tract after inoculation of ureaplasma urealyticum into the rat bladder were evaluated and compared to that seen after mycoplasma hominis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis inoculation. the inoculation of the urease-producing organisms p. mirabilis and u. urealyticum were associated with the formation of struvite bladder stones and predominantly hyperplastic lesions of the bladder. the p. mirabilis inoculated rats also displayed marked pyelonephritis. a similar but much less pronounced reaction also occurred in the kidneys of some of the u. urealyticum inoculated rats. p. mirabilis could frequently be recultured. in contrast, this was not possible with u. urealyticum, but the organism was detected by scanning electron microscopy 2 weeks after the inoculation. inoculation of m. hominis was associated with a few mild lesions of the bladder, but inflammatory lesions were not present in the kidneys. the study confirms the potential of ureaplasma to form struvite stones in rat urinary tract. it also demonstrates that it can induce inflammatory changes in both bladder and kidney of rats without concomitant stone formation.

TI == adherence of urease-induced crystals to rat bladder epithelium following acute infection with different uropathogenic microorganisms.
AB == apart from urine supersaturation with respect to struvite and calcium phosphate,  crystal retention is considered to be necessary for the formation of infection stones. this study was performed to investigate the role of the mucous coat in rat bladders in the adhesion of sterile urease-induced crystals and to determine to what extent the adhesion was influenced by infection. elimination of the mucous coat with 0.1 m hcl increased the adherence of crystals six times compared to that in bladders with an intact mucous coat. infection with proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterococci and ureaplasma urealyticum increased the adherence six, five, four and two times, respectively. injury to the mucous coat may thus be one mechanism by which microorganisms can contribute to the formation of infection stones in the urinary tract.

TI == a dna probe for detecting mycoplasma genitalium in clinical specimens.
AB == despite decades of careful study, the etiologies of all cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and non-gonococcal urethritis (ngu) have yet to be described. mycoplasma genitalium is a newly described organism which has been implicated as a cause of both pid and ngu. because of fastidious growth requirements, prolonged incubation time and frequent overgrowth in clinical specimens by mycoplasma hominis, non-culture methods need to be developed for its detection. we have cloned m. genitalium dna by transfection into escherichia coli using m13 as the vector. using these segments as templates, we synthesized radiolabelled cdnas that were tested for specific hybridization with m. genitalium, and clinically isolated genital mycoplasmas presumptively identified as m. hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. a 256 base-pair segment was found to hybridize with m. genitalium with a sensitivity of 10(2) colour-changing units (ccus). no cross-hybridization was observed with m. hominis, and cross-hybridization was observed only with large concentrations (greater than 10(6) ccus) of u. urealyticum. because of our choice of m13 as the vector, which contains the lac operon of e. coli, slight hybridization occurred with e. coli as well. this cdna can be used against clinical specimens to determine the ecologic niche and spectrum of disease caused by m. genitalium.

TI == effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB == all of the 14 serotype standard strains of ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. a 1 mm concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. the presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. this differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. for the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. for the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified. the effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. the concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus mycoplasma (m. hominis, m. fermentans, and m. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mm manganese. the latter concentration inhibited the growth of acholeplasma laidlawii and staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mm manganese had no effect on escherichia coli.
