TI  == comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. study design: an in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials,  using a disc-diffusion method. results: a total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited  resistance; on the other hand, ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. conclusion: the bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.

TI  == description of alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity, and reclassification of prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == five strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests  and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences showed that these strains represented a novel group within the family prevotellaceae, and the most closely related species was  prevotella tannerae. p. tannerae and the novel taxon are deeply branched from the genus prevotella, with sequence identities to the type strain of the type species of prevotella, prevotella melaninogenica, of 82.2 and 85.6 %, respectively. the novel genus alloprevotella gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the novel species alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov. and the previously named prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov. the type species is alloprevotella tannerae. the type strain of alloprevotella rava is 81/4-12(t) ( = dsm 22548(t) = ccug 58091(t)) and the type strain of alloprevotella tannerae is atcc 51259(t) = ccug 34292(t) = cip 104476(t) = nctc 13073(t). alloprevotella rava is weakly to moderately saccharolytic and produces  moderate amounts of acetic acid and major amounts of succinic acid as end products of fermentation. strains are sensitive to 20 % bile and hydrolyse gelatin. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids are anteiso-c15 : 0, iso-c15 : 0, c16 : 0, iso-c17 : 0 and iso-c17 : 0 3-oh. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 47 mol%.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == black stain - a review.
AB  == the purpose of this review was to summarise the fundamentals about black stain, its diagnosis and possible differential diagnoses as well as its microbiology and therapy. in addition, various studies investigating the relationship between black stain and dental caries are examined. many studies report lower caries prevalence in children with black stain, but this finding could not be confirmed  by all authors. also, a negative relation between degree of staining and caries severity has been described. reasons for these results are not yet clear but it was speculated that they are related to the specific oral microflora described in black stain-affected individuals.

TI  == trends in antibiotic resistance in prevotella species from patients of the university hospital of maxillofacial surgery, sofia, bulgaria, in 2003-2009.
AB  == head-and-neck infections often involve anaerobes such as prevotella species. aim  of the present study was to assess the evolution and the factors associated with  resistance in prevotella species to penicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline and beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (bl/blis). in total, 192  prevotella strains, isolated from patients with oral and head-and-neck infections, were evaluated. common isolates were prevotella intermedia and prevotella melaninogenica within the pigmented species as well as prevotella oris and prevotella oralis group within the non-pigmented species. overall resistance  was 43.2% for penicillin, 10.9% for clindamycin, 0% for metronidazole. nonsusceptibility to tetracycline was 29.1% without significant differences in resistance rates between pigmented and other species. penicillin resistant strains were beta-lactamase positive. from 2003-2004 to 2007-2009, penicillin resistance rates increased about four-fold (from 15.4% to 60.6%). clindamycin resistance did not show evolution, whereas tetracycline nonsusceptibility decreased from 43.3% in 2003-2004 to 20.7% in 2007-2009. except for one (0.5%) p. oralis strain with intermediate susceptibility to bl/blis, the other strains were susceptible to the agents. in conclusion, in prevotella strains from patients with head-and-neck infections, the resistance rate to penicillin increased, that  to clindamycin remained stable and the nonsusceptibility rate to tetracycline decreased during the period. activity against >99% of prevotella strains was observed with metronidazole and bl/blis. the penicillin resistance and tetracycline nonsusceptibility were associated with the year of study, national antibiotic consumption and possibly with previous treatment (for tetracycline). the evolution of penicillin resistance in prevotella strains was highly dynamic.

TI  == prevotella fusca sp. nov. and prevotella scopos sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests  and were found to belong to two separate taxa. phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the strains were both related to, but distinct from, the type strain of prevotella melaninogenica. two novel species, prevotella fusca sp. nov. and prevotella scopos sp. nov., are proposed to accommodate these strains. both strains were saccharolytic and produced acetic and succinic acids, with lesser amounts of lactic and isovaleric acids, as end products of fermentation, and both were sensitive to 20 % bile. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids of both strains were ai-c(15 : 0), 3-oh i-c(17 :  0), 3-oh c(16 : 0), i-c(15 : 0) and c(16 : 0). the dna g+c contents of the type strains of prevotella fusca (w1435(t) = dsm 22504(t) = ccug 57946(t)) and prevotella scopos (w2052(t) = dsm 22613(t ) = ccug 57945(t)) were 43 and 41 mol%, respectively. the two species could be differentiated by gelatin hydrolysis, cellobiose and ribose fermentation, and production of beta-glucosidase.

TI  == the identification of genes specific to prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens using genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, which are often isolated from periodontal sites, were once considered two different genotypes of p. intermedia. although the genomic sequence of p. intermedia was determined recently, little is known about the genetic differences between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the  subtractive hybridization technique is a powerful method for generating a set of  dna fragments differing between two closely related bacterial strains or species. we used subtractive hybridization to identify the dna regions specific to p. intermedia atcc 25611 and p. nigrescens atcc 25261. using this method, four p. intermedia atcc 25611-specific and three p. nigrescens atcc 25261-specific regions were determined. from the species-specific regions, insertion sequence (is) elements were isolated for p. intermedia. is elements play an important role in the pathogenicity of bacteria. for the p. intermedia-specific regions, the genes adenine-specific dna-methyltransferase and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase  were isolated. the p. nigrescens-specific region contained a flavobacterium psychrophilum spra homologue, a cell-surface protein involved in gliding motility, prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 glutathione peroxide, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 leucyl-trna synthetase. the results demonstrate that the subtractive hybridization technique was useful for distinguishing between the two closely related species. furthermore, this technique will contribute to our understanding of the virulence of these species.

TI  == oral microbial and respiratory status of persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disability: an observational cohort study.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of select  microorganisms in oral biofilms and to investigate relationships between oral and respiratory status in persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disabilities (idd). study design: we conducted a 6-month-long observational cohort study with 63 persons with idd. oral examinations, oral sampling, and medical record reviews were performed at baseline and then monthly. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to analyze all baseline oral samples for the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), prevotella melaninogenica, and candida albicans. pcr analyses were also performed on participants' samples collected in the month before being diagnosed with a respiratory infection. results: all subjects had p. melaninogenica detected by pcr in their oral samples. fifty-five percent (35 of 63) of participants had s. pneumoniae, mrsa, and c. albicans in their oral samples at baseline. no dental decay was detected clinically, oral hygiene was fair, and dysphagia was common. during the 6 months of the study, there were 22 respiratory infections (35% of participants)-12 pneumonias, 7 sinusitis, 1 bronchitis, and 1 upper respiratory tract infection. participants with microorganisms in their baseline samples were significantly more likely to develop any respiratory infection and those who had poor oral status were significantly more likely to develop pneumonia. almost 60% of participants who developed respiratory infections had the same microorganism detected in the sample collected in the month before infection as had been detected in their baseline sample. conclusion: potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity and poor oral status significantly increased the risk of developing respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in persons with idd. the results suggest that colonization with these microorganisms may persist despite routine tooth brushing. meticulous comprehensive oral hygiene of the oral cavity may be needed to reduce oropharyngeal microbial load.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == prevotella histicola sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == three strains of anaerobic, variably pigmenting, gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral mucosal tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the genus prevotella, being most closely related to prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella veroralis. a novel species, prevotella histicola sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella histicola is saccharolytic and produces acetic acid and succinic acid  as major end products of fermentation and trace to minor amounts of isovaleric acid and lactic acid. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 43 mol%. the type strain of prevotella histicola is t05-04t (=dsm 19854t=ccug 55407t).

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == the relationship of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and prevotella melaninogenica in the supragingival plaque of children, caries and oral malodor.
AB  == purpose: a relationship between the distribution of periodontal bacteria species  and malodor in children has not been sufficiently investigated. the present study was undertaken to determine the presence of 3 periodontopathic bacteria (prevotella spp. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. melaninogenica) in the supragingival plaques of 3 to 16-year-old children with different oral health conditions and oral malodor. methods: the number of decayed and filled primary teeth (df) and decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (dmf), papillary marginal and attached gingivitis (pma) index, oral hygiene index (ohi), and oral  malodor of each subject were determined prior to the collection of supragingival  plaques. three periodontopathic bacteria (p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. melaninogenica) in supragingival plaques were detected by using an immunoslot blot assay with monoclonal antibodies specific for each microorganism. findings:  the frequencies of periodontopathic bacteria in children with and without caries  were not significantly different from each other. positivity for p. intermedia, but not for p. nigrescens or p. melaninogenica was correlated with oral malodor.  oral malodor was also correlated with the debris index, a component of ohi. the group with the higher ohi showed a higher prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria. for the 3 periodontopathic bacteria in the subjects tested, plaques positive for any of them were not age related. however the frequencies of all 3 periodontopathic bacteria were the highest in the 3-6-year olds. conclusion: the  supragingival plaques in children can harbor 3 species of periodontopathic bacteria, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. melaninogenica.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens are often regarded as principal causes of acute dentoalveolar infection; however, other species within the genus  are also known to be associated with such infection. the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro proteolytic activity of these different prevotella species that have been implicated with dentoalveolar infection. a total of 234 strains were obtained from pus specimens from dentoalveolar infection and from the plaque of healthy volunteers. prevotella loescheii, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae, and prevotella denticola were all shown to have a proteolytic activity (8.5-10.5 x 10(-8) a-units) lower than that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens (21.1-23.5 x 10(-8) a-units). in the case of p. loescheii, p. melaninogenica, and p. intermedia, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that recorded for commensal strains. proteolytic activity for all species of prevotella examined was inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. this study suggests that prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection produce cysteine and serine proteinases and that in certain species of prevotella, the strains involved in infection exhibit higher proteolytic activity when compared with strains from healthy sites.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == the salivary microbiota as a diagnostic indicator of oral cancer: a descriptive,  non-randomized study of cancer-free and oral squamous cell carcinoma subjects.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine if the salivary counts of 40 common oral bacteria in subjects with an oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) lesion would differ from those found in cancer-free (oscc-free)  controls. methods: unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 229 oscc-free  and 45 oscc subjects and evaluated for their content of 40 common oral bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. dna counts per ml saliva were determined for each species, averaged across subjects in the 2 subject groups, and significance of differences between groups determined using the mann-whitney  test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in detection of oscc by levels of salivary organisms were computed and comparisons made separately between a non-matched group of 45 oscc subjects and 229 controls and a group of 45 oscc subjects and 45 controls matched by age,  gender and smoking history. results: counts of 3 of the 40 species tested, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus mitis, were elevated in the saliva of individuals with oscc (p < 0.001). when tested as  diagnostic markers the 3 species were found to predict 80% of cancer cases (sensitivity) while excluding 83% of controls (specificity) in the non-matched group. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the matched group were 80% and 82% respectively. conclusion: high salivary counts of c. gingivalis, p. melaninogenica and s. mitis may be diagnostic indicators of oscc.

TI  == phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == vertebral osteomyelitis caused by prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenicus.
AB  == a 35-year-old, previously healthy female presented with severe low back pain, fever, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate 1 week after a routine dental cleaning. technetium-labeled leukocyte scanning and magnetic resonance imaging scan of the spine were negative for osteomyelitis. the patient underwent biopsy,  cultures from which grew prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenicus. appropriate antibiotic therapy resulted in resolution of symptoms. p. melaninogenicus is a gram-negative anaerobic bacillus that is part of the indigenous oral flora. it may cause dental, sinus, skin, and soft tissue infections. infection of bone is rare. only three cases of vertebral osteomyelitis due to p. melaninogenicus have  been reported in the literature. the early diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis requires a high index of clinical suspicion and cannot be excluded by negative imaging tests alone. the recovery of this unusual organism highlights the importance of requesting anaerobic cultures of biopsy specimens.

AB  == aim: to evaluate the relationship between oral bacteria species detection and volatile sulphide compounds (vsc) concentration in the elderly. design: cross-sectional microbiological and clinical vsc examination of elderly. participants: sixty-seven elderly people aged 75, who were functionally independent and dentate. methods: vsc (h2s and ch3sh) concentrations in the mouth air of subjects were measured using portable gas chromatography. oral bacteria samples were taken from dental plaque and identification of bacteria species was  accomplished using standard methods. results: fewer than 20% of subjects showed more than 10 ng/10 ml of h2s (severe odour level). the detection rate of p. melaninogenica was significantly higher in elderly people with more than 10 ng/10 ml (p=0.043) levels. fusobacterium had a tendency to be found in those with more  than 10 ng/10 ml, but a significant relation was not found. conclusions: the results suggest that fusobacterium and p. melaninogenica may be involved in the production of h2s in the oral cavity of elderly people.

TI  == frequency of reactivity for porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp. in supra- and subgingival plaques, and periodontal clinical parameters according to  subject age.
AB  == background: the present study was conducted to assess the association between selected clinical parameters and the distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and prevotella melaninogenica (pm) in supra- and subgingival plaque samples measured by an immunoslot blot assay (iba) using their monoclonal antibodies. methods: plaque samples from 299 patients aged 6 to 69 randomly chosen from a group of dental outpatients were examined. plaque index, gingival index, and probing depths were  evaluated according to the criteria of positive (cell number > or = 10(6)) or negative (<106) reactivity to the 4 different monoclonal antibodies. results: an  increase in probing depth in subjects exhibiting either a positive or negative reaction for the 4 test bacteria was associated with increasing age. comparing bacteria-positive subgingival plaque samples to their corresponding bacteria-negative counterparts, we found an increased plaque index in children positive for any of the 4 bacteria; in addition, that for pg and pi was increased in subjects 40 to 49 years old. the gingival index increased with increasing amount of pi and pn, but not with pg and pm in those 20 to 29 years of age. the frequency of pg reactivity in subgingival plaque was markedly enhanced in subjects older than 30 to 39 years of age, and was significantly higher than that in supragingival plaque. the frequency of pi and pn reactivity was significantly  increased in adults aged 20 to 29 and plateaued at older ages. the frequency of pm reactivity was relatively low and independent of subject age. conclusions: the increase in probing depth with increasing age was not affected by the occurrence  of periodontopathic bacteria. the high rate of occurrence of pg, together with pi and pn, in subgingival plaque of the adult age groups was suggested to be associated with the high frequency of periodontal disease in the older age groups (above 30 to 49 years of age). the iba appears to be useful for the efficient and rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == inhibition of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. we aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans. a total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans hk 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. the bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. the proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by p. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes r- and k-gingipains. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. the results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of a. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.

TI  == identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  == gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. the confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular  species within this group of organisms. this investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. forty-three reference strains  of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. the phenotypic screen easily differentiated porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. the screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to  species level with the kits. neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens. with the pcr method, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and porph. gingivalis was readily identified. because of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, pr. melaninogenica and pr. veroralis could not be separated by the pcr method.

AB  == strains resembling prevotella melaninogenica were isolated from healthy subjects  and patients with periodontal disease and were identified using: a 5-test phenotypic screen; commercial identification kits; and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. eleven clinical isolates closely resembling p. melaninogenica, and all from patients with periodontitis, were able to agglutinate erythrocytes. in the electron microscope, hemagglutinating isolates showed fimbria-like structures, that were not seen on non-hemagglutinating isolates. some strains were further classified with pcr-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (rflp) of 16s rrna genes. amplified  16s rdna was digested using five different endonucleases, separated with agarose  gel electrophoresis, stained and photographed. photographs were then scanned, digitized and a distance matrix calculated using dice coefficient, where the presence or absence of a band was used as a character. the distance matrix was plotted as a phenogram. at 70% similarity six clusters were seen. type strains of separate prevotella species did not fall into any cluster. hemagglutinating isolates fell into three clusters: four clustered with the type strains of p. melaninogenica and prevotella veroralis; four with other p. melaninogenica isolates and two hemagglutinating isolates clustered together prevotella loescheii. the pcr-rflp results showed that the hemagglutinating strains did not  form a homogenous group inside the prevotella genus.

AB  == the frequency of beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species isolated from 23 healthy young children and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 186 available beta-lactamase-positive isolates were examined by using  the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the etest (ab biodisk) and/or the agar dilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (villanova, pa, usa), respectively. beta-lactamase-positive prevotella melaninogenica strains were isolated from all  children, and more than two-thirds of the prevotella denticola and prevotella loescheii strains isolated from the children were beta-lactamase-positive. the beta-lactamase-producing prevotella intermedia group consisted of prevotella nigrescens and the p. intermedia/ p. nigrescens-like organism (pinlo); p. intermedia was not found. only two p. nigrescens isolates but most of the pinlo isolates produced beta-lactamase. the mics for beta-lactamase-producing strains varied between 0.38 and 64 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species colonizing young children is already frequent. the phenomenon should be taken into account in the treatment of pediatric anaerobic infections of oral origin.

TI  == inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a prevotella melaninogenica hemolysin.
AB  == hemolysins have been proven to be important virulence factors in many medically relevant pathogenic organisms. their production has also been implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. hemolytic strain 361b of prevotella melaninogenica, a putative etiologic agent of periodontal disease, was used in this study. the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of phya, the structural gene for a p. melaninogenica hemolysin, is described. no extensive sequence homology could be identified between phya and any reported sequence at either the nucleotide or amino acid level. as predicted from sequence analysis, this gene produces a 39-kda protein which has hemolytic activity as measured by zymogram analysis. unlike many ca2+-dependent bacterial hemolysins, both the cloned and native phya proteins were enhanced by the presence of edta in a dose-dependent fashion with 40 mm edta allowing maximum activity. ca2+ and mg2+ were found to be inhibitory. the hemolytic activity also was found to have a dose-dependent endpoint. through recovery of hemolytic activity from a spent reaction, this endpoint was shown to be the result of end product inhibition. this is the first  report describing the cloning and sequencing of a gene from p. melaninogenica.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == an investigation into the use of sds-page of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == by comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 prevotella intermedia and 19 prevotella nigrescens strains using  sds and analysed by sds-page, it was possible to distinguish the two species. a polypeptide of approx. 21 kda distinguished p. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kda could be used to identify p. nigrescens strains. four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii and prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kda polypeptides shown by p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of p. intermedia, 14 strains of p. nigrescens and one strain of p. gingivalis (w50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. the hydrolysis of the substrate gppna (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase iv-like activity) and  saappna (elastase-like activity) by p. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined  as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of p. intermedia strains hydrolysed saappna (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. the hydrolysis of gppna and saaapna by p. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of p. nigrescens strains hydrolysed saapppna with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. none of the p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (bapna hydrolysis). the gppna and saaapna hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 was at least twice that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens strains. the similar peptidase activities of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but sds-page of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. this simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == in vivo cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 by immunoglobulin a1 proteases from prevotella and capnocytophaga species.
AB  == immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases secreted by oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species specifically cleave iga1 at the same peptide bond in the hinge region, leaving intact monomeric fab and fc fragments. assuming that prevotella- and capnocytophaga-induced fab fragments of iga1 expose a specific immunogenic neoepitope at the cleavage site, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure human serum antibodies to this neoepitope as indirect evidence of in vivo activity of prevotella and capnocytophaga iga1 proteases. the assay used a monoclonal antibody with specificity for the neoepitope, and the ability to block binding of the monoclonal antibody to the neoepitope was investigated. absorption of sera with prevotella melaninogenica-induced fab fragments of iga1 resulted in removal of antibodies blocking binding of the monoclonal antibody, whereas absorption with fab fragments induced by bacterial iga1 proteases of other cleavage specificities did not remove blocking antibodies. consequently, we assume that the antibodies detected had been induced by a neoepitope an the fab fragment of iga1 exposed exclusively after cleavage with iga1 proteases from prevotella and capnocytophaga, indicating in vivo activity of these iga1 proteases. evidence, though indirect, of in vivo activity of prevotella and capnocytophaga iga1 proteases was present in 42 of 92 sera examined and in a significantly higher proportion of sera from adults with periodontal disease compared with control individuals. no correlation with disease was observed for the juvenile periodontitis groups.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == transmission of oral prevotella melaninogenica between a mother and her young child.
AB  == most likely, young children acquire their oral microflora by frequent transfer of bacteria between family members. the possible transmission of obligately anaerobic prevotella melaninogenica recovered from 11 mother-child pairs was examined by ribotyping. one to 18 isolates (mean 13) per child from different oral sampling sites and 4 to 17 (mean 10) isolates per mother from stimulated salivary samples, collected on 2 occasions, were analyzed. on sampling, the mean  ages of the children were 4 months and 32 months, respectively. restriction endonucleases kpni and clai were chosen for the digestion of chromosomal dna. dna fragments were electrophoretically separated, blotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with rrna operon of escherichia coli. dna-dna hybrids were detected immunologically. extensive genetic heterogeneity, 101 distinct ribotypes, was observed among 248 p. melaninogenica isolates studied. both mothers and children  harbored several (up to 7) ribotypes which, apart from 3 ribotypes, were distinguishable in unrelated subjects. several p. melaninogenica ribotypes were detected on both sampling occasions over 2 years apart. identical ribotypes were  found in 6 of the 11 mother-child pairs, 1 to 2 similar ribotypes per pair. this  suggests the transmission of p. melaninogenica between the mother and her child,  probably via maternal saliva. however, the unique ribotypes found in these children also indicate that other sources besides the mother influence the oral colonization of young children.

AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. the bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). during the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. prevotella  melaninogenica, nonpigmented prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum group and capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. the occurrence of prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, campylobacter (wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. only the occurrence of bacteroides gracilis and veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as prevotella denticola, fusobacterium spp. other than the f. nucleatum group and selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. the stability of the  colonizing p. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == an in-vitro study of the comparative viability on different swab types of simulated specimens of bacteria commonly present in oro-facial infections.
AB  == an in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of amies transport medium. standard inocula of pure cultures of streptococcus milleri, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked  on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation.  differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. recovery of prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. we conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == pigmented prevotella species in the periodontally healthy oral cavity.
AB  == pigmented prevotella spp. have been connected with oral infections as well as being part of the healthy gingival flora. the aim of this study was to determine  the presence of pigmented prevotella spp. in saliva and gingival crevice samples  from periodontally healthy adults. twelve caucasian female subjects (mean age 28  years, range 21-36 years) with no pockets > or = 4 mm, nor bleeding after probing were selected for this study. paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected first; then, a pooled subgingival bacterial sample was taken with a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of all first molars. the samples were inoculated on to non-selective and selective media and incubated anaerobically. the most frequent  species isolated were pr. melaninogenica, pr. intermedia and pr. loescheu, found  in 11, ten and nine subjects, respectively. the mean percentage of the total cultivable anaerobic microflora in salivary/subgingival samples were 14.7/0.6 for pr. melaninogenica, 3.1/5.3 for pr. intermedia and 2.6/1.2 for pr. loescheii. pr. denticola was found in one saliva sample and pr. corporis, in two subgingival samples only. the number of different pigmented prevotella spp. in the same mouth was 2-4 (mean 2.75). in conclusion, pr. melaninogenica, pr. intermedia and pr. loescheii seem to be common microorganisms in the periodontally healthy oral cavity.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in periodontitis.
AB  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes have been associated with periodontal disease and tooth loss since they were first isolated by burdon in 1928. porphyromonas gingivalis, which is usually not isolated from children, adolescents or adults with no periodontal breakdown, has been recognized as one of the most important periodontopathogens. its presence is strongly correlated with deep periodontal pockets, which are assumed to be its main habitat. correlations have been shown also with attachment loss, clinical inflammation and serum antibody levels, indicating an aetiological role in the periodontal disease. their pathogenicity in animal models resembling periodontal disease is documented. they are frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses. the relationship between prevotella intermedia and periodontal disease is not clear.  it is frequently isolated from advanced periodontitis, often as the only black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic species; however, the prevalence in adults with no periodontal breakdown is high. it is found frequently in periodontal abscesses and in acute necrotizing and ulcerative gingivitis. serogroup i is found predominantly in deep periodontal pockets, whereas all serogroups (i-iii) are found in shallow pockets and gingivitis. no conclusive difference in pathogenicity between serogroups has been found. pr. melaninogenica, pr. denticola and pr. loescheii are frequently found in the gingival crevice in preschool children and other age groups with gingivitis, but  are seldom found in deep periodontal pockets.

TI  == relationship between oral gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in saliva of the mother and the colonization of her edentulous infant.
AB  == various gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species can be detected in the oral flora of edentulous infants. however, knowledge of the initial infection source is still scarce. thirty caucasian mothers (mean age 30 years) and their edentulous infants (mean age 3 months) were examined for the possible similarity  of the oral gram-negative anaerobic flora. paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected from the mothers. a pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces and unstimulated saliva were collected from the infants. the samples were inoculated  on nonselective and selective media and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. all of the 30 mothers harbored fusobacterium nucleatum and 29 mothers prevotella  melaninogenica in their saliva. the salivary levels of p. melaninogenica, f. nucleatum, nonpigmented prevotella spp., prevotella intermedia and prevotella loescheii exceeded 10(4) cfu/ml in about half of the 30 mothers. at this maternal salivary level, the infants' colonization frequency of p. melaninogenica and f. nucleatum was doubled. a positive correlation between maternal salivary concentration and infant's colonization was found for p. melaninogenica. no positive association was found with nonpigmented prevotella spp., p. intermedia and p. loescheii. it can be speculated that maternal saliva may act as a source of some gram-negative anaerobes in the oral microflora of edentulous infants as early as before tooth eruption.

TI  == microbiota associated with residual clefts and neighboring teeth in patients with cleft lip, alveolus, and palate.
AB  == twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. one microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and  two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic gram-negative organisms. fusobacterium spp., prevotella melaninogenica, and p. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. while rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were  a common feature of nonrecall patients. the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. the differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. the cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. samples from clefts were never wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less capnocytophaga and actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.

TI  == immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, and fusobacterium.
AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

"no other bacterial group discriminated significantly between test and control sites or between diseased and non-diseased subjects. the surprisingly high occurrence of p. gingivalis in non-diseased subjects, both subgingivally and on tongue, indicates that deep periodontal pockets are not prerequisite ecological environments for p. gingivalis establishment.

AB  == particulate, nonresorbable hydroxylapatite is currently a popular implant material for the augmentation of atrophic alveolar ridges. most reports have demonstrated favorable biocompatibility with common usage, but how the host bone  will respond to the implant in the presence of an infection has not yet been investigated. hydroxylapatite was implanted subperiosteally on one side of the mandible in four new zealand white rabbits. after 3 months were allowed to elapse for stabilization of the implant, an infection was induced in both sides of each  mandible by inoculation with bacteroides melaninogenicus. one month later the animals were put to death and both sides of each mandible were examined microscopically. on the nonaugmented side there was total resolution of the infection. the side of each mandible containing the hydroxylapatite implant showed very mild chronic inflammation throughout the medullary space and periosteum. although the number of animals used was small, the results suggest that the presence of the hydroxylapatite implant may have interfered with the host's ability to resolve the infection in the underlying bone. the possible mechanism of this interference is discussed.

AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.

TI  == cross-inhibition between black-pigmented bacteroides species.
AB  == cross-inhibition within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides, including both  oral and non-oral strains, was studied by means of a membrane filter technique. it was found that b. gingivalis possessed the most extended inhibitory capacity among all species tested. b. gingivalis showed inhibitory activity against b. intermedius, b. endodontalis, b. loescheii, and b. melaninogenicus. b. endodontalis was active against some b. intermedius strains. among the saccharolytic species, some b. melaninogenicus strains were inhibitory for some b. endodontalis strains, some b. gingivalis strains, and some b. intermedius strains. these inhibitory activities observed in vitro may play a role in the colonization of the periodontal pocket.

TI  == chromosomal dna probes for the identification of bacteroides species.
AB  == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and  b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.

TI  == infectious oral necrosis (cancrum oris) in nigerian children: a review.
AB  == the devastating orofacial gangrenous disease known as cancrum oris (noma) is still commonly seen in underprivileged nigerian children. these children are usually victims of such stressors as chronic malnutrition, numerous endemic communicable diseases and severe adverse physical conditions which may lead to depletion of their adaptive resources or produce physiological maladaptation to additional stressors. measles is the most common infection preceding the development of noma in nigerian children. acquired immunodeficiency as well as the impaired endocrine balance of the chronically malnourished permits, for example, widespread infection with the measles virus. anergy resulting from the combination of malnutrition and measles virus infection promotes selective overgrowth and invasion by an infective consortium consisting of anaerobic organisms and other species capable of elaborating necessary growth factors for the former. because of the pre-existing depletion of adaptive physiologic resources in the malnourished child, the infection is not readily contained locally as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis but instead spreads rapidly to the next naturally occurring anatomical barriers. this is then followed by continuing necrosis and possible sequestration as exemplified by noma.

AB  == the outer membranes from selected oral bacteroides species were isolated and characterized morphologically, chemically, and physically. both sucrose density gradient centrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) revealed outer membranes which varied slightly with the species, as well as showing complex polypeptide patterns after sds--page. the polypeptide distribution revealed a species-specific pattern; however, there was  often a variation within a given species in many minor polypeptide bands, with heat-modifiable minor peptides occurring in nearly all species. protein-associated carbohydrates occurred in several species. outer membrane fragments (blebs) recovered by ultracentrifugation of the growth supernatants were either nearly identical to the outer membrane polypeptide patterns, or contained reduced amounts of specific polypeptides, again varying with the species. 125i-labelling of whole cells indicated possible surface exposure for several of the major polypeptides.

AB  == the temporal response of zinc and copper metabolism to endotoxin administration was examined in syrian hamsters over a 144-hour period. serum copper was significantly elevated at 12, 24 and 72 hours after endotoxin, whereas serum zinc was reduced 4-48 hours after treatment. a brief elevation (8 hours) in liver copper concentration and a sustained (72 hours) increase in liver zinc concentration were also observed. the amount of zinc associated with liver metallothionein (mt) progressively increased with time, to a plateau by 24 hours  and persisted at the elevated level until 72 hours after endotoxin treatment. in  vitro translation of poly (a)+ rna from liver polyribosomes showed that following endotoxin treatment mtmrna activity was maximally elevated 6 hours after endotoxin administration and remained elevated 24 and 48 hours thereafter. slab gel electrophoresis of serum proteins indicated changes in a stainable protein comigrating with purified ceruloplasmin after endotoxin administration. pooled gingival tissue from endotoxin-treated hamsters demonstrated a consistently elevated copper content 12-144 hours after treatment. endotoxin isolated from bacteroides melaninogenicus was more effective in elevating gingival and serum copper and gingival zinc than escherichia coli endotoxin. it was concluded that endotoxin administration elicits responses that result in enhanced metaollthionein mrna activity. in addition, cu and zn concentrations in serum, liver and gingival tissue are influenced by different endotoxins to different degrees.

TI  == characterization of volatile sulphur production by pathogenic and non-pathogenic  strains of oral bacteroides.
AB  == marked differences were observed in intermediate sulphur metabolism between non-pathogenic strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus var melaninogenicus (cp-) and pathogenic bacteroides melaninogenicus asaccharolyticus (cp+). the cp+ strains, which produced collagenase and protease and caused formation of abscesses when injected subcutaneously into groins of guinea pigs, produced copious amounts of volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) which consisted predominantly of ch3sh and (ch3s)2. hydrogen sulphide occurred in considerably lesser amounts.  cp+ cultures yielded 8-fold more total volatile s, 15-fold more ch3sh and 260-fold more (ch3s)2 during 24 h of incubation in trypticase-yeast extract medium. whereas h2s accounted for 60 per cent of the total volatile s content of  the head-space of cp- cultures, it represented only 8 per cent of the volatile s  in cp + systems. although the cp-organisms did not grow as well as cp +, the differences in concentration of vsc may be only partly related to the disparity in growth rates. when the vsc concentrations were calculated on the basis of equivalent optical density of 1.0, the cp + strains still produced over 3-fold more total volatile s, 6-fold more ch3sh and 100-fold more (ch3s)2. a similar allowance for growth rate suggests that cp-strains may possess a greater potential to produce h2s. both groups metabolized s-containing amino acids and serine, resulting in appreciable increases in h2s production by cp-. however, the two groups appeared to metabolize the carbon moiety of cystine an cysteine by different pathways. the addition of glucose to the medium depressed total volatile s production by both cp+ and cp-strains, attributable mostly to lower h2s levels. whereas the omission of yeast extract and charcoal treatment of trypticase did not adversely effect the activity of cp+, it further markedly reduced the capacity of cp-cultures to produce vsc. these results suggest that vsc analysis offers a convenient means of assessing strain differences and pathogenic potential of b. melaninogenicus.

AB  == more than 1000 strains of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, including reference strains, clinical isolates, and members of the normal flora of the mouth, lower gastro-intestinal tract and vagina of healthy human subjects, were studied by conventional bacteriological methods and by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of metabolic products in a series of investigations. a short combined set of tests with particular discriminant value was selected, and a scheme for the identification of the species and subspecies encountered in the diagnostic bacteriological laboratory was based upon our composite results. the tests are: antibiotic-disk resistance tests with neomycin 1000 micrograms, kanamycin 1000 micrograms, penicillin 2 units and rifampicin 15 micrograms per disk; tolerance tests with sodium taurocholate, victoria blue 4r and gentian violet; and tests for pigment production, indole production, aesculin hydrolysis and the fermentation of glucose, lactose, sucrose, rhamnose, trehalose, mannitol and xylose. gram-negative anaerobic bacilli are divided into four groups: (1) the fragilis group with nine species, which include the five subgroups previously classified as subspecies of b. fragilis; (2) the melaninogenicus-oralis group, which includes the three saccharolytic subspecies (ss.) of b. melaninogenicus--ss. melaninogenicus, ss. intermedius and ss. levii--and four non-pigmented species; (3) the asaccharolytic group, which comprises b. asaccharolyticus (formerly b. melaninogenicus ss. asaccharolyticus), b. corrodens and other non-pigmented non-saccharolytic strains, and (4) the fusobacteria.

TI  == the isolation and identification of bacteroides spp. from the normal human gingival flora.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of subgingival plaque from 20 normal, healthy adults without periodontal disease. a heavy growth of bacteroides and fusobacterium spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were selected for identification by conventional bacteriological methods. results were obtained in these tests with 188 isolates; some strains of the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group would not grow in pure culture on solid media and showed satellitism in mixed culture, and some strains of fusobacteria did not survive repeated subculture. most isolates (68%) belonged to the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group. the commonest species identified in this group were b. oralis (41%), b. melaninogenicus ss. melaninogenicus (26%) and ss. intermedius (17%). b. oralis was isolated from all subjects and at least one strain of b. melaninogenicus was isolated from 18 out of 20 subjects. only eight strains of the b. fragilis group were detected and they probably represented transient carriage. fusobacterium spp. and l. buccalis were isolated from 15 out of 20 subjects and accounted for 21% of the isolates studied, but most could not be identified specifically by the set of tests used. asaccharolytic species of bacteroides were isolated in small numbers from seven subjects.

TI  == the effect of intensive antibacterial therapy on the sulcular environment in monkeys. part i. changes in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus.
AB  == the changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. two rhesus monkeys were scaled  and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic  tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. over the 40 day experimental period and  74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. the plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. the total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from  initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. the flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. during treatment b. melaninogenicus and fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. after cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but b. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.

TI  == clinical and microbiological aspects of chemotherapeutic agents used according to the specific plaque hypothesis.
AB  == certain forms of dental decay and periodontal disease appear to be due to specific bacterial infections following overgrowth of certain indigenous plaque bacteria, i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis, if so, then antimicrobial treatment based on a diagnosis of elevated levels or proportions of these organisms should be considered. such treatment cannot be administered according to concepts of the non-specific plaque hypothesis. a treatment philosophy is presented which is based upon considerations long established in medical infections following overgrowth of certain indigenous plaque bacteria, i.e., the  specific plaque hypomicrobial to the site of the infection for periods long enough to suppress or destroy the pathogenic agent. examples of this treatment philosophy are given.

TI  == the role of bacteroides melaninogenicus and other anaerobes in periodontal infections.
AB  == recent taxonomic and anatomical studies of dental plaque associated with periodontal health and disease have demonstrated that differences in the microbial populations in plaque may be responsible for the initiation and progression of disease. the consistent isolation of large numbers of anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria from the depths of periodontal lesions has suggested an  important role for these organisms. bacteria that have been isolated include capnocytophaga (bacteroides ochraceus), other species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, selenomonas, spirochetes, campylobacter, veillonella, actinomyces, propionibacterium, peptococcus, and other genera. the periodontopathic potential  of oral strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus has been explored in a number of investigations because these organisms are consistently isolated from periodontal lesions. studies of b. melaninogenicus have included purification of a capsular substance, characterization of the lipopolysaccharide and a variety of toxic substances and lytic enzymes, and ecologic aspects of its colonization. understanding of the nature and pathogenic mechanisms of the oral microbiota may  lead to control of this pandemic infection.

TI  == longitudinal study of experimentally induced periodontal disease in macaca arctoides: relationship between microflora and alveolar bone loss.
AB  == macaca arctoides monkeys develop periodontal disease, and they harbor a periodontopathic indigenous flora largely similar to that of humans. this study showed that various haemophilus isolates and h2o2-splitting asaccharolytic bacteroides melaninogenicus strains constituted major segments of the monkey periodontal microflora. these organisms have not been previously identified among human isolates. furthermore, the present data revealed that asaccharolytic b. melaninogenicus strains increased in proportion from a few percent to about 66% of the total isolates concomitant with the development of a significant loss of alveolar bone mass. hence, this study strongly implicates b. melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus and closely related strains as important pathogens in actively destructive periodontal disease.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen in acute suppurative parotitis. although anaerobic bacteria are prevalent in the normal oral and upper respiratory tract flora and frequently are involved in oral and facial infections, they have seldom been isolated from patients with suppurative parotitis. it may be that a role for anaerobes in parotitis has not been documented because of inadequate specimen transport or anaerobic culture techniques. we describe two cases of acute suppurative parotitis in which cultures yielded anaerobic bacteria. in one case, no aerobes were isolated; in the other, the anaerobe was the predominant organism numerically.

TI  == attachment of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.

TI  == blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: comparison  of individuals with periodontal disease to normal and edentulous subjects.
AB  == cell-mediated immunity in humans to antigens derived from oral plaque bacteria was investigated by using the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. subjects with varying severities of periodontal disease including normal, gingivitis, periodontitis, and edentulous were compared. mononuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood and cultured with antigens prepared by sonication of actinomyces viscosus (av), actinomyces naeslundii (an), veillonella alcalescens (va), leptotrichia buccalis (lb), bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm), and homologous dental plaque (dp). the lymphocyte response of subjects with gingivitis or periodontitis was significantly greater than that of normal subjects to antigens of av, an, and dp, but did not differ from the response of edentulous subjects. periodontitis subjects were significantly more reactive than edentulous and normal subjects in response to va, lb, and bm. these findings suggest that the tested gram-negative bacteria and the host response they evoke are associated with advanced periodontal destruction.

AB  == the reliability of fiberoptic bronchoscopy as a method to study the bacteriology  of the lower respiratory tract was tested. the procedure used was suction aspiration through the inner channel after topical anesthesia with lidocaine. to  detect contamination by oropharyngeal bacteria, the aspirates were cultured in patients with no evidence of active infection, comparison was made with results of transtracheal aspiration cultures, and the aspirate was tested for the presence of an oral dye marker. results with all 3 methods of analysis indicated  contamination with oropharyngeal bacteria that were presumably introduced during  instrumentation through the upper airways. an additional factor studied was the effect of topical anesthetics. analysis of aspirates showed that as much as 96 per cent of the specimen was anesthetic solution. lidocaine also proved toxic to  lower respiratory tract pathogens, although there were significant differences between bacterial species. it was concluded that fiberoptic bronchoscopy as performed in this study does not reliably reflect the bacteriology of the lower respiratory tract.
