TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == ethenoguanines undergo glycosylation by nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferases at non-natural sites.
AB  == deoxyribosyl transferases and functionally related purine nucleoside phosphorylases are used extensively for synthesis of non-natural deoxynucleosides as pharmaceuticals or standards for characterizing and quantitating dna adducts.  hence exploring the conformational tolerance of the active sites of these enzymes is of considerable practical interest. we have determined the crystal structure at 2.1 a resolution of lactobacillus helveticus purine deoxyribosyl transferase (pdt) with the tricyclic purine 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine (n2,3-ethenoguanine) at the active site. the active site electron density map was compatible with four orientations, two consistent with sites for deoxyribosylation and two appearing to be unproductive. in accord with the crystal structure, lactobacillus helveticus pdt glycosylates the 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine at n7 and n1, with a marked preference for  n7. the activity of lactobacillus helveticus pdt was compared with that of the nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase enzymes (drt type ii) from lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus fermentum, which were somewhat more effective in the deoxyribosylation than lactobacillus helveticus pdt, glycosylating the substrate with product profiles dependent on the ph of the incubation. the purine nucleoside phosphorylase of escherichia coli, also commonly used in ribosylation  of non-natural bases, was an order of magnitude less efficient than the transferase enzymes. modeling based on published active-site structures as templates suggests that in all cases, an active site phe is critical in orienting the molecular plane of the purine derivative. adventitious hydrogen bonding with  additional active site residues appears to result in presentation of multiple nucleophilic sites on the periphery of the acceptor base for ribosylation to give a distribution of nucleosides. chemical glycosylation of o9-benzylated 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine also resulted in n7 and n1 ribosylation. absent from the enzymatic and chemical glycosylations is the natural pattern of n3 ribosylation, verified by comparison of spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with an authentic standard synthesized by an unambiguous route.

TI  == a methodological approach to screen diverse cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds.
AB  == microorganisms play an important role in the development of cheese flavor. the aim of this study was to develop an approach to facilitate screening of various cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds. we combined i) curd-based slurry medium incubated under conditions mimicking cheese manufacturing and ripening, ii) powerful method of extraction of volatiles, headspace trap, coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (hs-trap-gc-ms),  and iii) metabolomics-based method of data processing using the xcms package of r software and multivariate analysis. this approach was applied to eleven species:  five lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus helveticus), four actinobacteria (brachybacterium articum, brachybacterium tyrofermentans, brevibacterium aurantiacum, and microbacterium gubbeenense), propionibacterium freudenreichii, and hafnia alvei. all the strains grew, with maximal populations  ranging from 7.4 to 9.2 log (cfu/ml). in total, 52 volatile aroma compounds were  identified, of which 49 varied significantly in abundance between bacteria. principal component analysis of volatile profiles differentiated species by their ability to produce ethyl esters (associated with brachybacteria), sulfur compounds and branched-chain alcohols (h. alvei), branched-chain acids (h. alvei, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei), diacetyl and related carbonyl compounds (m.  gubbeenense and l. paracasei), among others.

TI  == naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria isolated from tomato pomace silage.
AB  == silage making has become a significant method of forage conservation worldwide. to determine how tomato pomace (tp) may be used effectively as animal feed, it was ensilaged for 90 days and microbiology counts, fermentation characteristics and chemical composition of tomato pomace silage (tps) were evaluated at the 30th, 60th, and 90th days, respectively. in addition, 103 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from tps. based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s rdna sequence and carbohydrate fermentation tests, the isolates were identified as 17 species namely: lactobacillus coryniformis subsp.  torquens (0.97%), lactobacillus pontis (0.97%), lactobacillus hilgardii (0.97%),  lactobacillus pantheris (0.97%), lactobacillus amylovorus (1.9%), lactobacillus panis (1.9%), lactobacillus vaginalis (1.9%), lactobacillus rapi (1.9%), lactobacillus buchneri (2.9%), lactobacillus parafarraginis (2.9%), lactobacillus helveticus (3.9%), lactobacillus camelliae (3.9%), lactobacillus fermentum (5.8%), lactobacillus manihotivorans (6.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (10.7%), lactobacillus harbinensis (16.5%) and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (35.0%). this study has shown that tp can be well preserved for 90 days by ensilaging and that tps is not only rich in essential nutrients, but that physiological and biochemical properties of the isolates could provide a platform for future design of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants aimed at improving the fermentation quality of silage.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  == background: akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most west african countries. the identities of lab populations from dgge analysis and conventionally isolated lab and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by pcr sequencing analysis. the relationships between ph, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. results: the lab communities  in the akamu samples comprised mainly lactobacillus species, including lb. fermentum, lb. plantarum, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and lb. helveticus, as  well as lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. identified yeasts were candida tropicalis, candida albicans, clavispora lusitaniae and saccharomyces paradoxus.  low ph (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). ash was  either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kj g(-)(1). conclusion: the akamu samples were  predominantly starchy foods and had ph < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative lab.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == development of a multiplex real time pcr to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  == a multiplex real time pcr (mrealt-pcr) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. novel primers directed toward phes gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus fermentum. the assay was based on sybr green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. the method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (lab) in 29 different natural whey starters for parmigiano reggiano cheese production. the results obtained by mrealt-pcr were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and length-heterogeneity pcr (lh-pcr). the mrealt-pcr developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of dna and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor lab community members of thermophilic starter cultures. the assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. a higher number of whey starter samples with s. thermophilus and l.  fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in parmigiano reggiano natural whey starter  samples than previously shown. the method was more effective than lh-pcr and fish and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mrealt-pcr was also faster. providing a single step sensitive detection of l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii, s. thermophilus and l. fermentum, the developed mrealt-pcr could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during  ripening of derived dairy products. a major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == the investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. we collected 66 samples of the traditional mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 lab strains were isolated and identified based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence. the predominant species of those products were lactobacillus (l.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and lactococcus lactis ssp.  lactis. however, we could not detect any lab strains from eezgii. all lab isolates were screened for tolerance to low ph and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to caco-2 cells. in vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as l. plantarum or l. paracasei subspecies, based on 16s ribosomal dna and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. these strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the dornogovi province.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == [genetic diversity of the genus lactobacillus bacteria from the human gastrointestinal microbiome].
AB  == the species and strain genetic diversity of bacterial cultures belonging to the genus lactobacillus, which were isolated from the gastrointestinal microbiome of  the human population living in the former soviet union in the years 1960-1980, was studied. the bacteria demonstrated probiotic characteristics. phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the gene coding for 16s rrna detected earlier by us, showed that the gene found in bacteria isolated from the intestinal content of healthy adults and represented by species l. plantarum, l. helveticus, l. casei/paracasei, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum has high homology (97-100%) with  this gene in type representatives of the species. the genotypic and strain diversity of cultures was studied using rapd-pcr and nonspecific primers. this method with the use of the eric-1 primer gave reliable and reproducible results as compared that using with m13 and msp primers and allowed the identification of examined bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus at the level of species and certification at the strain level.

AB  == a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. fermentum, was developed. the target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (l. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (l. fermentum). the analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived  from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus and enterococcus genera. the identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)cfu/ml. this new molecular assay was used to investigate the lab  population by direct extraction of dna from the 12 whey cultures for grana padano. the pentaplex pcr assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor lab community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

AB  == in this study we investigated the suitability of commercial starters for the production of gluten free sourdoughs. for this purpose, four different laboratory scale sourdoughs were developed from the flours buckwheat or teff. two different  starters (sa, sb) were used to start the fermentations, which were carried out under two technological conditions. sourdoughs were propagated by back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable sourdoughs was investigated by culture dependent techniques and the development of the dominant  biota was monitored by pcr-dgge. unique and complex lab and yeasts communities were detected in each sourdough, comprising strains which originated from the flours. the competitiveness of the starter lab varied according to the substrate  and the fermentation conditions applied. among the lab present in both sa and sb, l. helveticus and l. paracasei strains did not persist in buckwheat or teff sourdoughs. lc. argentinum was competitive only in buckwheat sourdoughs, whereas  l. reuteri persisted only in teff sourdough. l. fermentum and l. helveticus present in both starters dominated only the sourdoughs fermented at the higher temperature. remarkably, the starter yeasts were outcompeted by spontaneous yeast strains, i.e. kazachstania barnetti and saccharomyces cerevisiae in teff sourdoughs, whereas no yeasts were isolated from buckwheat sourdoughs. the isolation of autochthonous lab and yeasts from the stable teff and buckwheat sourdoughs indicates that both flours represent an important reservoir for the isolation of novel and competitive starters for the production of gluten free sourdough bread.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == isolation of cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with  mesophilic starter and molecular comparison with dairy-related lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == aims: to isolate cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with mesophilic starter and compare them with dairy-related lactobacillus helveticus strains using molecular typing methods. methods and results: the number of thermophilic bacteria in seven commercial cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starters was estimated to be <10 cfu g(-1). implementation of an enumeration step in the isolation method made it possible to isolate one thermophilic strain from each of five of seven cheeses. comparing repetitive sequence pcr (rep-pcr) profiles of the isolates with dairy-related lact. helveticus strains indicated that one isolate was a lact. helveticus. partial sequencing of 16s rrna confirmed this, and the remaining four strains were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecium. the rep-pcr profile of the isolated lact. helveticus was identical to the rep-pcr profile of the lact. helveticus adjunct culture used in the specific  cheese, but their pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiles differed slightly. conclusion: it was possible to isolate cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starter and thermophilic adjunct cultures by using an enumeration step. significance and impact of the study: isolation of cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses made with mesophilic starters offers an original source for new dairy-relevant cultures.

TI  == adaptability of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts to sourdoughs prepared from cereals, pseudocereals and cassava and use of competitive strains as starters.
AB  == the adaptability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts to sourdoughs prepared  from cereals, pseudocereals and cassava was investigated using pcr-dgge and bacteriological culture combined with rrna gene sequence analysis. sourdoughs were prepared either from flours of the cereals wheat, rye, oat, barley, rice, maize, and millet, or from the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, or  from cassava, using a starter consisting of various species of lab and yeasts. doughs were propagated until a stable microbiota was established. the dominant lab and yeast species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus spicheri, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the proportion of the species within the microbiota varied. l. paralimentarius dominated in the pseudocereal sourdoughs, l. fermentum, l. plantarum and l. spicheri in the cassava sourdough, and l. fermentum, l. helveticus and l. pontis  in the cereal sourdoughs. s. cerevisiae constituted the dominating yeast, except  for quinoa sourdough, where i. orientalis also reached similar counts, and buckwheat and oat sourdoughs, where no yeasts could be detected. to assess the usefulness of competitive lab and yeasts as starters, the fermentations were repeated using flours from rice, maize, millet and the pseudocereals, and by starting the dough fermentation with selected dominant strains. at the end of fermentation, most of starter strains belonged to the dominating microbiota. for  the rice, millet and quinoa sourdoughs the species composition was similar to that of the prior fermentation, whereas in the other sourdoughs, the composition  differed.

TI  == a qualified presumption of safety approach for the safety assessment of grana padano whey starters.
AB  == a qualified presumption of safety (qps) approach was applied to dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with grana padano cheese whey starters. thirty-two strains belonging to lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus fermentum, and representing the overall genotypic lab diversity associated with 24 previously collected whey  starters [rossetti, l., fornasari, m.e., gatti, m., lazzi, c., neviani, e., giraffa, g., 2008. grana padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution. international journal of food microbiology 127, 168-171], were analyzed. all l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus isolates were susceptible to four (i.e. vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin) of the clinically most relevant antibiotics. one  l. fermentum strain displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (tet(r)), with mic of 32 microg/ml, and gentamycin (gm(r)), with mic of 32 microg/ml. pcr was applied to this strain to test the presence of genes tet(l), tet(m), tet(s),  and aac(6')-aph(2')-ia, which are involved in horizontal transfer of tet(r) and gm(r), respectively but no detectable amplification products were observed. according to qps criteria, we conclude that grana cheese whey starters do not present particular safety concerns.

TI  == a traditional sudanese fermented camel's milk product, gariss, as a habitat of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  == samples of the traditional sudanese fermented camel's milk product gariss representing 9 different regions in sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. lactic acid bacteria [log(cfu/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(cfu/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. a total of 180 lab isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the streptococcus bovis group. thirteen representative isolates were characterized by pcr amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpob and soda and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). all thirteen isolates were identified as streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. the gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. the same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and ph=2.7 for 1-4 h.  also lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas enterococcus  faecium and lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. the yeast microflora in all gariss samples consisted of kluyveromyces marxianus and issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.

TI  == grana padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture grana padano cheese. twenty-four grana padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of italy were analyzed. total thermophilic lab streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. population  structure of the dominant and metabolically active lab species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-pcr (rt-lh-pcr), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. the dominant bacterial species were lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus fermentum. diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). only a minor fraction of the cultures contained l. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four lab species (11%). five hundred and twelve  strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by m13-pcr fingerprinting coupled with 16s rrna gene sequencing. most of the strains were l. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), l delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and s. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). this result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by rt-lh-pcr. m13-pcr fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. the distribution of the  biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than  correlated with the different production areas.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from bulgarian women.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. the development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of  vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation.  the aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal lactobacillus  isolates obtained from bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. a combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. all vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ardra results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. finally, the strains were  subjected to pcr analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following  species: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ardra or ribotyping, followed by pcr specific primers identification at species level.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for grana  padano cheese by length heterogeneity-pcr.
AB  == aims: to detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (lh)-pcr. lh-pcr allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16s rrna  gene sequences. methods and results: lh-pcr was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) species recoverable from grana padano cheese whey starters. typical bacterial species present in the lab community were evidenced and well discriminated. small differences in species composition, e.g.  the frequent finding of streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (lactobacillus helveticus, lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. specificity of  lh-pcr was confirmed by species-specific pcr from total dna of the cultures. conclusions: lh-pcr is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. when present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as strep. thermophilus, can  easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. a similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such  as milk or cheese curd. significance and impact of the study: community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy,  fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.

AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal  donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in  l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid  determinants in laf and laf.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == detection and activity of lactacin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == a total of 52 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. a majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of lactobacillus leichmannii, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus lactis. four l. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited streptococcus faecalis and  lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by l. acidophilus. the agent produced by l. acidophilus n2 and responsible for inhibition of l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, and l. lactis was investigated. ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. the agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c (ph  5). activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. these characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin b. examination of strains of l. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of johnson et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin b could not be used in classification of neotype l. acidophilus strains. however, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin b in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == [bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  == lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into  bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
