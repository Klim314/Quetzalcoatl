TI  - Role of secondary metabolites in establishment of the mutualistic partnership between Xenorhabdus nematophila and the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae.
AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila engages in a mutualistic partnership with the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, which invades insects, migrates through the gut, and penetrates into the hemocoel (body cavity). We showed previously that during invasion of Manduca sexta, the gut microbe Staphylococcus saprophyticus appeared transiently in the hemocoel, while Enterococcus faecalis proliferated as X. nematophila became dominant. X. nematophila produces diverse secondary metabolites, including the major water-soluble antimicrobial xenocoumacin. Here, we study the role of X. nematophila antimicrobials in interspecies competition under biologically relevant conditions using strains lacking either xenocoumacin (DeltaxcnKL strain), xenocoumacin and the newly discovered antibiotic F (DeltaxcnKL:F strain), or all ngrA-derived secondary metabolites (ngrA strain). Competition experiments were performed in Grace's insect medium, which is based on lepidopteran hemolymph. S. saprophyticus was eliminated when inoculated into growing cultures of either the DeltaxcnKL strain or DeltaxcnKL:F strain but grew in the presence of the ngrA strain, indicating that ngrA-derived antimicrobials, excluding xenocoumacin or antibiotic F, were required to eliminate the competitor. In contrast, S. saprophyticus was eliminated when coinjected into M. sexta with either the DeltaxcnKL or ngrA strain, indicating that ngrA-derived antimicrobials were not required to eliminate the competitor in vivo. E. faecalis growth was facilitated when coinjected with either of the mutant strains. Furthermore, nematode reproduction in M. sexta naturally infected with infective juveniles colonized with the ngrA strain was markedly reduced relative to the level of reproduction when infective juveniles were colonized with the wild-type strain. These findings provide new insights into interspecies competition in a host environment and suggest that ngrA-derived compounds serve as signals for in vivo nematode reproduction.
TI  - Microbial population dynamics in the hemolymph of Manduca sexta infected with Xenorhabdus nematophila and the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae.
AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila engages in a mutualistic association with the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. The nematode invades and traverses the gut of susceptible insects. X. nematophila is released in the insect blood (hemolymph), where it suppresses host immune responses and functions as a pathogen. X. nematophila produces diverse antimicrobials in laboratory cultures. The natural competitors that X. nematophila encounters in the hemolymph and the role of antimicrobials in interspecies competition in the host are poorly understood. We show that gut microbes translocate into the hemolymph when the nematode penetrates the insect intestine. During natural infection, Staphylococcus saprophyticus was initially present and subsequently disappeared from the hemolymph, while Enterococcus faecalis proliferated. S. saprophyticus was sensitive to X. nematophila antibiotics and was eliminated from the hemolymph when coinjected with X. nematophila. In contrast, E. faecalis was relatively resistant to X. nematophila antibiotics. When injected by itself, E. faecalis persisted (~10(3) CFU/ml), but when coinjected with X. nematophila, it proliferated to ~10(9) CFU/ml. Injection of E. faecalis into the insect caused the upregulation of an insect antimicrobial peptide, while the transcript levels were suppressed when E. faecalis was coinjected with X. nematophila. Its relative antibiotic resistance together with suppression of the host immune system by X. nematophila may account for the growth of E. faecalis. At higher injected levels (10(6) CFU/insect), E. faecalis could kill insects, suggesting that it may contribute to virulence in an X. nematophila infection. These findings provide new insights into the competitive events that occur early in infection after S. carpocapsae invades the host hemocoel.
