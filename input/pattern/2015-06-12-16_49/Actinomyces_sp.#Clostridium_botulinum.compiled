TI  - Persistent extraradicular infection in root-filled asymptomatic human tooth: scanning electron microscopic analysis and microbial investigation after apical microsurgery.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Procedural accidents have a negative effect on healing and might contribute to the persistence of infections in inaccessible apical areas, requiring surgical intervention. This report describes a case of persistent apical periodontitis of a lower left first molar associated with the sinus tract and a periapical lesion that required nonsurgical endodontic retreatment and apical surgery for resolution. METHODS: The tooth had received endodontic treatment 3 years ago and had to be retreated using the crown-down technique with chemical auxiliary substance (2% chlorhexidine gel), foramen patency, and enlargement and was filled in a single appointment. The occlusal access cavity was immediately restored with composite resin. After 1 month, it could be observed that the sinus tract persisted and, radiographically, the lesion remained unaltered. Therefore, endodontic microsurgery was indicated. Apical microsurgery was performed under magnification with the use of a dental operating microscope including apicectomy, root end with ultrasound, and sealing with mineral trioxide aggregate. A microbiological sample was collected from the apical lesion. The resected distal root apex was observed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The following species were detected: Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces meyeri, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium botullinum, Parvimonas micra, and Bacteroides ureolyticus; scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed bacterial biofilm surrounding the apical foramen and external radicular surface. Gutta-percha overfilling at the apex because of a zip caused during initial endodontic treatment could be observed. A 6-month follow-up showed apparent radiographic periapical healing, which progressed after 24 months. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and extraradicular biofilm seem to participate in the maintenance of persistent periapical pathology, and endodontic retreatment followed by periapical microsurgery proved to be a successful alternative in the resolution of persistent extraradicular infections.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The strains formerly classified as Streptococcus anginosus or "Streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus Gemella. Four new species within the genus Peptostreptococcus were recently named. A recent addition to the genus Clostridium is Clostridium argentinense, which includes Clostridium botulinum type G. Two new species of Actinomyces have been introduced: Actinomyces georgiae and Actinomyces gerencseriae. Arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed Propionibacterium propionicum. Eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. Lactobacillus uli and Lactobacillus rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. Bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva are now included in the genus Campylobacter. The taxonomic position of Mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family Bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
