characterization of the effects of three lactobacillus species on the function of chicken macrophages.
lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius can influence the adaptive immune responses in chickens but vary in their ability to do so. the present study attempted to identify how these three bacteria alter the innate immune system. a chicken macrophage cell line, mq-ncsu, was co-cultured with the three live lactobacillus species, alone or in combination, grown at different temperatures for various durations of time. late exponential growth phase bacteria were more immunostimulatory, while bacterial growth temperature had little effect. l. acidophilus and l. salivarius significantly increased nitric oxide (no) production and phagocytosis, while l. reuteri did not. in fact, l reuteri was shown to inhibit no production of macrophages when co-cultured with the other bacteria or when cells were pre-treated with lps. the results demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of l. acidophilus and l. salivarius, and a unique immunomodulatory ability of l. reuteri.
in vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from chicken and calves.
a total of 73 chicken and calves isolates were diagnosed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). after a preliminary subtractive screening based on the high acid tolerance at ph 2.5 and bile resistance at 0.3% oxgall, twenty isolates belonging to the species lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus amylovorus were in vitro screened for the safety assessment and probiotic properties, including antibiotics susceptibility patterns, biochemical activity and potential for competitive exclusion of biofilm producing pathogens determined by crystal violet and/or quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridisation (fish) assays utilizing 5'cy 3 labelled probe enter1432 for enteric group. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the iso norm 10932. the sixteen strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents, except for two chicken (l. salivarius 12k, l. agilis 13k) and two calves (l. reuteri l10/1, l. murinus l9) isolates with the presence non wild-type ecoffs (epidemiological cut-off) for gentamicin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)), tetracycline (>/=128 mug ml(-1)), kanamycin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)) and streptomycin (>/=96 mug ml(-1)). the two referenced chicken isolates gave positive aac(6')ie-aph(2'')ia and tet(l) pcr results. the wild-type ecoffs isolates were subjected to the apizym analysis for enzyme profile evaluation and amino acid decarboxylase activities determined by qualitative plate method and multiplex pcr for the detection of four genes involved in the production of histamine (histidine decarboxylase, hdc), tyramine (tyrosine decarboxylase, tyrdc) and putrescine (via eithers ornithine decarboxylase, odc, or agmatine deiminase, agdi). from examined strains only two chicken isolates (l. reuteri 14k; l. salivarius 15k) had no harmful beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase activities connected with detrimental effects in the gastrointestinal tract and together no amino acid decarboxylase activities and no genes associated with biogenic amines production though only chicken l. salivarius 15k whole cells and acid supernatants shown strong suppressive potential against biofilm-forming klebsiella and escherichia coli. our results highlight that above-mentioned isolate l. salivarius 15k fulfils the principle requirements of a qualified probiotic and may be seen as a reliable candidate for further validation studies in chicken.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus), gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
probiotic properties of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
isolation of a lactobacillus salivarius strain and purification of its bacteriocin, which is inhibitory to campylobacter jejuni in the chicken gastrointestinal system.
we evaluated anti-campylobacter jejuni activity among >1,200 isolates of different lactic acid bacteria. lactobacillus salivarius strain nrrl b-30514 was selected for further study. the cell-free, ammonium sulfate precipitate from the broth culture was termed the crude antimicrobial preparation. ten microliters of the crude preparation created a zone of c. jejuni growth inhibition, and growth within the zone resumed when the crude preparation was preincubated with proteolytic enzymes. bacteriocin or-7, derived from this crude preparation, was further purified using ion-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. the determined amino acid sequence was consistent with class iia bacteriocins. interestingly, or-7 had sequence similarity, even in the c-terminal region, to acidocin a, which was previously identified from l. acidophilus and had activity only to gram-positive bacteria, whereas or-7 had activity to a gram-negative bacterium. bacteriocin activity was stable following exposure to 90 degrees c for 15 min, also consistent with these types of antibacterial peptides. the purified protein was encapsulated in polyvinylpyrrolidone and added to chicken feed. ten day-of-hatch chicks were placed in each of nine isolation units; two groups of birds were challenged with each of four c. jejuni isolates (one isolate per unit). at 7 days of age, one group of birds was treated with bacteriocin-emended feed for 3 days, and one group was left untreated. at 10 days of age, the birds were sacrificed and the challenge strain was enumerated from the bird cecal content. bacteriocin treatment consistently reduced colonization at least one millionfold compared with levels found in the untreated groups. nonchallenged birds were never colonized by c. jejuni. bacteriocin from l. salivarius nrrl b-30514 appears potentially very useful to reduce c. jejuni in poultry prior to processing.
lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of salmonella enteritidis (se) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. all samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. the means +/- sd of total lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. in the cloaca, lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. in the vagina, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. in the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of se. there was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. no difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. the present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against se colonization.
lactic acid-mediated suppression of helicobacter pylori by the oral administration of lactobacillus salivarius as a probiotic in a gnotobiotic murine model.
objectives: we examined whether or not the lactobacilli administered to treat helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection can suppress the colonization of h. pylori, and we also sought to elucidate the mechanism of such suppression. methods: we used an in vitro culture system and an h. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. results: among the lactobacillus species examined in vitro, lactobacillus salivarius (l. salivarius) but not l. casei or l. acidophilus proved to be capable of producing a high amount of lactic acid and thus completely inhibiting the growth of h. pylori in a mixed culture. the validity of l. salivarius as a probiotic to suppress h. pylori and thus reduce the inflammatory response was again confirmed in vivo by using an h. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. conclusion: based on our findings, l. salivarius was found to be a potentially effective probiotic against h. pylori.
antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. lactobacillus salivarius m7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin b which inhibits the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. a new atypical bacteriocin produced by lact. acidophilus m46, acidocin b, combines the inhibition of clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. acidocin b is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees c for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. native acidocin b occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kda), while with sds-page the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kda. optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin b produced during growth. growth is not necessary for acidocin b production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. the application potential of acidocin b is discussed.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
[differentiation of several species of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium according to their bacteriocin sensitivity spectra].
the method of retarded antagonism was applied to the study of l. acidophilus (187 cultures), l. salivarius (65 cultures), l. jugurti (16 cultures), l. helveticus (4 cultures) sensitivity to the action of 39 bacteriocines produced by various lactobacilli species. by the sensitivity spectra to bacteriocines l. ecidophilus cultures were divided into 76, l. salivarius--22, l. jugurti--15, and l. helveticus into 2 bacteriocines. by bacteriocine typing it was possible to differentiate into a number of bacteriocine types l. acidophilus and l. salivarius variants with the same biochemical and physiological properties.
[sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.
