TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in moroccan soft white cheese (jben).
AB  == the bacterial diversity occurring in traditional moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in morocco, was studied. a total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. the majority of the strains belonged to the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc and enterococcus.  sixteen species were identified: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc citreum, eterococcus  durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus saccharominimus and streptococcus sp.
