TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == periodontal bacteria colonizing oral mucous membranes in edentulous patients wearing dental implants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [pipd], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. a mean pipd of 3.6 mm was found. a statistically significant correlation was found between the pipd and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. the subjects harboring prevotella intermedia showed presence of pipd of > or = 5 mm. all subjects harbored peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and other prevotella species. actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. they harbored higher proportions of peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. the results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. the results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. it is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis.
