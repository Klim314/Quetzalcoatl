TI  == isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis).
AB  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) bears coaggregation-mediating surface adhesins which recognize galactoside-containing surface polysaccharides on streptococcus oralis 34, streptococcus oralis c104, and streptococcus sm pk509. fifty-nine spontaneously-occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of s. gordonii dl1 unable to coaggregate with partner streptococci were isolated. six representative cog- mutants were characterized by their coaggregation properties  with four actinomyces naeslundii strains (t14v, pk947, pk606, pk984), veillonella atypica pk1910, and propionibacterium acnes pk93. the six representative cog- mutants showed altered coaggregation with their streptococcal partners, a. naeslundii pk947, and p. acnes pk93. based on the coaggregation phenotypes of these mutants, a model for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and its partner bacteria is proposed. the potential use of these mutants in studies of oral biofilms is discussed.
