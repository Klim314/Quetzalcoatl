TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == [phenotypic and genotypic characterization of probiotic bacterial strains used in medicinal products].
AB  == introduction: the optimization of quality testing strategy of products containing probiotics might allow to general improvement of its safer use in humans. the goal of the study was the evaluation of quality expressed by identity, colony forming unit (cfu) and antibiotic sensitivity ofprobiotics used in medicinal products available in poland using the appropriate and validated procedures. methods: the medicinal products containing l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and b. animalis subsp. lactis, l. helveticus, and l. gasseri were tested for species identity performed with validated rep-pcr (boxa 1r) method. the antimicrobial susceptibility of working seeds and strains isolated to 26 antibiotics were tested by disk diffusion and e-test methods using relevant references as recommended by eucast. the numbers of probiotic strains, expressed as cfu count per package, was done using plating plunge method. results: all strains tested, except b. lactis, were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, and colistin. b. lactis was resistant to aminoglycosides. l. rhamnosus strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, (mic > 256 microg/ml) similarly to atcc strains (l. rhamnosus gg 53103 and 244). the sensitivity to other antibiotics was strain specific. the rep-pcr method was found species and strain specific. all products  tested fulfilled declared countent as measured by cfu count/package. conclusions: quality of medicinal products containing probiotics was found undoubted and confirmed. the optimized strategy of quality monitoring of probiotics used in medicinal products can be used in dietary supplements and foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.

TI  == assessment of probiotic viability during cheddar cheese manufacture and ripening  using propidium monoazide-pcr quantification.
AB  == the use of a suitable food carrier such as cheese could significantly enhance probiotic viability during storage. the main goal of this study was to assess viability of commercial probiotic strains during cheddar cheesemaking and ripening (4-6 months) by comparing the efficiency of microbiological and molecular approaches. molecular methods such as quantitative pcr (qpcr) allow bacterial quantification, and dna-blocking molecules such as propidium monoazide  (pma) select only the living cells' dna. cheese samples were manufactured with a  lactococci starter and with one of three probiotic strains (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus rhamnosus ro011, or lactobacillus helveticus ro052) or a mixed culture containing b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and l. helveticus ro052 (mc1), both lactobacilli strains (mc2), or all three strains (mc3). dna extractions were then carried out on pma-treated and non-treated cell pellets in order to assess pma treatment efficiency, followed by quantification using the 16s rrna gene, the elongation factor tu gene (tuf) or the transaldolase gene (tal). results with intact/dead ratios of bacteria showed  that pma-treated cheese samples had a significantly lower bacterial count than non-treated dna samples (p < 0.005), confirming that pma did eliminate dead bacteria from pcr quantification. for both quantification methods, the addition of probiotic strains seemed to accelerate the loss of lactococci viability in comparison to control cheese samples, especially when l. helveticus ro052 was added. viability of all three probiotic strains was also significantly reduced in mixed culture cheese samples (p < 0.0001), b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 being  the most sensitive to the presence of other strains. however, all probiotic strains did retain their viability (log 9 cfu/g of cheese) throughout ripening. this study was successful in monitoring living probiotic species in cheddar cheese samples through pma-qpcr.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.
