TI  == validation of sterility testing of cord blood: challenges and results.
AB  == background: sterility testing for cord blood (cb) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. here, the automated bact/alert (biomerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in cb units processed at the canadian national public cord blood bank. study design and methods: a three-phase validation was developed. cb units  were prepared with pentastarch (phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (phase 3). in phase 1, cb was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans. plasma (8 ml) and buffy  coat (bc; 0.5 and 8 ml) were inoculated into culture bottles. in phases 2 and 3,  a mix of red blood cells (rbcs) and plasma (4 ml each) was used as the inoculant. in phase 3, aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product rbcs and plasma were determined. the bc fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. results: in phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in cb units containing antibiotics. thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. c. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of rbcs and plasma, all organisms were detected. the use  of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. c. albicans and a. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in rbcs and bc. cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during cb processing. conclusions: a mix of plasma and rbcs is appropriate for cb sterility testing. interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. the clinical significance of the  bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in cb merits further investigation.

TI  == appendicitis in a child due to streptococcus pneumoniae: a rare case report.
AB  == a variety of bacterial species play a major role in appendicitis. both aerobic and anaerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species and citrobacter freundii cause appendicitis. appendicitis is usually polymicrobial. the case assumes importance because of single aetiological agent i.e. unimicrobial and no predisposing factors are present to cause infection. we report a rare case of appendicitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae in child. this case emphasizes that streptococcus pneumoniae can cause wide spectrum of disease  like appendicitis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  == background: the source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (git) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (vlbw, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. we hypothesize the built environment (be), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature vlbw infants. here, we present the first matched fecal-be time series analysis of two preterm vlbw neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) over the first month of life. results: fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an illumina hiseq2000 device. for each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each nicu room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (emirge) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16s rrna amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. over 24,000 full-length 16s rrna sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (otus) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. dominant gut taxa, including staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. reconstructed genomes  from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and  sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the nicu environment. conclusions: we have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16s rrna gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. the approach enabled identification of discrete icu reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.

TI  == tissue concentrations of antibiotics given prophylactically during colorectal cancer surgery.
AB  == background/aims: this study was designed to clarify the pharmacokinetics of prophylactically administered cefmetazole in serum, intestinal tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. methodology: cefmetazole sodium (1 g) was given intravenously during the  induction of anesthesia, followed by a 1-g dose after 3 hours. blood samples were taken at the start of surgery, immediately before administration of the additional dose of cefmetazole, at the time of lesion resection, and at the time  of wound closure. tissue samples were obtained immediately after lesion resection and at the time of wound closure. concentrations of cefmetazole in serum and tissue were measured by high performance liquid chromatography using an internal  standard for calibration. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of cefmetazole for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis were measured, and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. results: in subcutaneous adipose tissue, cefmetazole concentrations were maintained higher than the mic80's for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, but were low in all patients regardless of the time of measurement. conclusions: the low transition rate of cefmetazole into subcutaneous adipose tissue indicates the need for additional measures, such as high-pressure washing of the subcutaneous wound tissue.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.
AB  == avibactam (formerly nxl104, ave1330a) is a synthetic non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of ambler class a and c beta-lactamases and some ambler class d enzymes. this review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry,  mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. although not a beta-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to beta-lactamases. very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. the addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzyme(s). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold mic reduction). limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp.). the pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration  of ceftazidime. the maximum plasma drug concentration (c(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. the mean volume of distribution and half-life of  22 l (~0.3 l/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative isolates. the safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has  been reported in three phase i pharmacokinetic studies and two phase ii clinical  studies. ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.in conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ss-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. the  exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl), klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and/or ampc ss-lactamases. in addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus p. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (ssi) in japan.
AB  == to investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (ssi), a japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. seven main organisms were collected from ssi at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. a total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with ssi were included. staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and enterococcus faecalis  (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4  %) and bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). methicillin-resistant s. aureus among s. aureus was 72.0 %. vancomycin mic 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. in escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). of e. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (caz) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (cpfx). no p. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. in p. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4  % to tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), 10.2 % to imipenem (ipm), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and cpfx, and 0 % to gentamicin. in the b. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to taz/pipc and ipm, and 0 % to metronidazole (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0  %). mic(9)(0) of p. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in taz/pipc, caz, ipm, and cpfx. in patients with american society of anesthesiologists (asa) score >/=3, the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa to taz/pipc and caz were higher than in patients with asa </=2. the data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause ssi. timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == the bacterial flora of acute appendicitis at the port moresby general hospital in papua new guinea.
AB  == acute appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdomen requiring an emergency appendicectomy. complications such as perforation and peritoneal contamination leading to peritonitis can result from delay in presentation and an emergency operation. this study prospectively recruited 101 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis to correlate the bacterial flora with the severity of appendicitis.  the results show that 90 patients had acutely inflamed or gangrenous appendicitis and 11 had perforated appendicitis. the ages ranged from 6 to 49 years with a median of 20 years. there were 59 females and 42 males. the commonest isolates were aerobic bacteria such as escherichia coli, group d streptococci and klebsiella pneumoniae. mixed infection with anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis was seen only in perforated appendicitis. the best choices of antibiotic were a fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for aerobic organisms and metronidazole for anaerobes.

TI  == significance of perioperative infection in survival of patients with ovarian cancer.
AB  == objectives: perioperative infectious diseases comprise some of the most common causes of surgical mortality in women with ovarian cancer. this study was aimed to evaluate the significance of perioperative infections in survival of patients  with ovarian cancer. methods: patients who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery were included in the analysis (n = 276). the enumeration and speciation of pathogens, antimicrobial agents used, and sensitivity assay results were culled from medical records and correlated to clinicopathologic demographics and  survival outcomes. perioperative infection was determined as a positive microbiology result obtained within a 6-week postoperative period. results: the incidence of perioperative infection was 15.9% (common sites: urinary tract, 57.3%, and surgical wound, 21.4%). commonly isolated pathogens were enterococcus  species (22.4%) and escherichia coli (19.4%) in urinary tract infection, and bacteroides fragilis, e. coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae (all, 16%) in surgical wound infection. imipenem represents one of the least resistant antimicrobial agents commonly seen in urinary tract and surgical wound infections in our institution. perioperative infection was associated with diabetes, serous histology, lymph node metastasis, bowel resection, decreased bicarbonate, and elevated serum urea nitrogen in multivariate analysis. perioperative infections were associated with increased surgical mortality, delay in chemotherapy treatment, decreased chemotherapy response, shorter progression-free survival (median time, 8.4 vs 17.6 months; p < 0.001), and decreased overall survival (29.0 vs 51.8 months; p = 0.011). multivariate analysis showed that perioperative infections other than urinary tract infection remained a significant risk factor  for decreased survival (progression-free survival, p = 0.02; and overall survival, p = 0.019). conclusion: perioperative infectious disease comprises an independent risk factor for survival of patients with ovarian cancer.

TI  == [microbiology of surgical site infections in abdominal tract surgery patients].
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the microbiology of surgical infections after abdominal surgery can be of use when prescribing effective empirical antibiotic treatments. method: analysis of surgical infections after abdominal surgery in patients enrolled in the prevalence of infections in spanish hospitals (epine) corresponding to the years 1999-2006. results: during the period of the study, 2,280 patients who were subjected to upper or lower abdominal tract surgery were  diagnosed with an infection at the surgical site (ssi). eight hundred and eighty  three patients (37%) had an operation of the upper abdominal tract (gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic surgery) and 1,447 patients (63%) lower abdominal tract surgery (appendectomy and colon surgery). a total of 2,617 bacterial species were isolated in the 2,280 patients included in the analysis. the most frequent microorganisms isolated were, escherichia coli (28%), enterococcus spp.  (15%), streptococcus spp. (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and staphylococcus aureus (5%, resistant to methicillin 2%). in the surgical infections after upper  abdominal tract procedures, there were a higher proportion of isolations of staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp. and candida albicans and less escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium  spp. conclusion: the microbiology of ssi produced after upper abdominal tract surgery did not show any significant differences compared to those of the lower tract. however, more cases of ssi were detected due to staphylococci, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp. and candida albicans and less caused by escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium spp.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (dfi). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in dfi, including gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic  bacteria with 95% of mics < or =2 microg/ml for the entire collection. the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for dfi, such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. as reported previously, pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum  activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility  of tigecycline for pathogens associated with dfis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and nine other antibiotics against gram-negative bacterial isolates, including esbl-producing strains.
AB  == the enterobacteriaceae, especially escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., as well  as acinetobacter spp., are important agents of nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients. a total of 460 gram-negative bacteria (gnb), were investigated for their susceptibility to tigecycline and 9 other antibiotics by the etest. esbl production was inferred from esbl etest phenotypes. all the gnb,  including the esbl-producers, were susceptible to tigecycline with mic(90 )ranges of 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. imipenem and meropenem were very active against esbl and  non-esbl producers; mean mic(90)s of 0.19 and 0.09 microg/ml and 0.05 microg/ml and 0.02 microg/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s of imipenem and meropenem for the  acinetobacter spp. were 16 and >32 microg/ml, respectively with resistance rates  of 64.3 and 66.1%. esbl production was detected in 62% and 82.1% of the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. resistance to ciprofloxacin was higher  among the esbl-producing strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae than the non-esbl producers. comparatively, tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and demonstrated superior activity against acinetobacter spp. increasing esbl production and resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in enterobacteriaceae require careful selection of empirical therapy.  tigecycline holds promise as an alternative choice of therapy for infections caused by esbl-producing isolates and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter spp.

TI  == fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. the  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. in this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with fournier's gangrene. methods: a retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. results: the 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. the mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. overall mortality was 22.7%. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). the etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. the most common isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp., and proteus mirabilis. there were a total of 74 debridements. other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). major complications of fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock,  hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). conclusions: early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  == background: for its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. to avoid the interaction of  the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (cpm) to induce neutropenia. although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. methods: fifteen female icr mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of cpm on days 1 and 4, respectively. blood samples (approximately 160 microl) were  drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of wright-stained smears. the impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (s. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (s. aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis). results: the basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. on day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. conclusion: a cpm total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  == faropenem (far) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. this study compared far to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (bla) stability and emergence of resistance to staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. bla stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, providencia  rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, s. aureus, and bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. far as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from s. aureus and e. coli. however, e. coli- and p. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas far was highly stable. far was highly stable against hydrolysis by various blas prepared from four b. fragilis strains and the rate of far hydrolysis by metallo-bla was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. additionally, the acquisition of resistant s. aureus strains was less pronounced  for far compared to other agents tested. mics rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-mic  exposure, while mics rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. e. coli shifts in mics were moderate for all the agents tested. in conclusion, far is characterized by pronounced bla stability compared  to other cephalosporins and imipenem. furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with far as compared to cephalosporins was observed.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == [a questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis in urology].
AB  == a questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis was conducted to obtain the consensus on perioperative antimicrobial use among urologists in japan in the period from april to july 2000. sixty-three of the 87  urologists replied, and the following consensus was obtained. an antimicrobial prophylaxis (amp) agent should be chosen based on their efficacy against the pathogens expected to be contaminants, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae and bacteroides fragilis group. use an amp agent that achieves a bactericidal concentrations in both the serum and operating site. use  an amp agent that has little unfavourable side effects. the newer agents should be considered as a therapeutics for postoperative infections. the therapeutic antimicrobial agents having no cross-resistance to the amp agents should be used, if postoperative infection is suspected or developed. the most commonly used agent for clean operations are cefazolin (cez), followed by cefotiam (ctm) and piperacillin (pipc), in this order. for clean-contaminated operations, the most commonly used agent is ctm, followed by pipc and cez.

TI  == evaluation of a new etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  == several etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (ip) or ceftazidime (tz) mics in the presence of edta or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa).  the etest metallo-beta-lactamase (etest mbl) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of ip or tz (4 to 256 microg/ml) and ip or tz (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of edta or mpa. the prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and mueller-hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), aeromonas spp. (n = 8), chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), escherichia coli (n = 1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), proteus  mirabilis (n = 3), serratia spp. (n = 10), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). pcr analysis using specific primers for imp-1, l1, ccra, and bla(b/c) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. enzyme assays were also performed with ip as an indicator substrate followed by edta inhibition profiles. edta was  found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. ip was a better than tz. mueller-hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low mics for ip. etest ip plus ip-edta with mueller-hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). the etest mbl  strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. the first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the n-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase i, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase i. other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, e-1010, s-4661 and bms-181139. carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, dz-2640, cs-834 and gv-129606. carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. this differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. however, class b beta-lactamases, along with some rare class a and d enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. although class b enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp., bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, flavobacterium spp. and legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in b. fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and members of enterobacteriaceae such as serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. the very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  == background and aims: altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. we investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. methods: a colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to  the abdominal wall through two colostomies. the loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop  was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. results: colonisation with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. colonisation with lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. conclusions: certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.

AB  == our objective is to develop a prophylactic vaccine strategy that can be evaluated for surgical and other high-risk hospitalized patients. in this paper, we describe the preparation and preclinical evaluation of a liposomal complete-core  lipopolysaccharide (lps) vaccine that is nontoxic and broadly antigenic. complete-core (ra-chemotype) lpss were isolated from four gram-negative bacterial strains (escherichia coli k-12, e. coli r1, pseudomonas aeruginosa pac608, and bacteroides fragilis), mixed together to form a cocktail of complete-core lpss, and then incorporated into multilamellar liposomes consisting of dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol in a 4:1:4 molar ratio. the endotoxic activities of these lps-containing liposomes were less than 0.1% of the endotoxicities of the original free lpss as measured by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. in vivo administration of liposomal complete-core lps mixed with al(oh)(3) to rabbits resulted in no pyrogenicity or  overt toxicity over a 7-day period. in immunoblots, sera from rabbits following active immunization elicited cross-reactive antibodies to a large panel of rough  and smooth lpss from numerous clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria, including e. coli (serotypes o1, o4, o6, o8, o12, o15, o18, o75, o86, o157, and o111), p. aeruginosa (fisher-devlin serotypes 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to international antigenic typing scheme types 6, 11, and 2, respectively), klebsiella pneumoniae (serotypes o1, o2ab, and o3), b. fragilis, and bacteroides  vulgatus. active immunization of mice with liposomal complete-core lps provided protection against a lethal challenge with e. coli o18 lps. the vaccine tested was nontoxic, nonpyrogenic, and immunogenic against a wide variety of pathogens found in clinical settings.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  == clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. a total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. the traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). a total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), peptostreptococcus spp (113), clostridium spp (78), prevotella spp (58), and fusobacterium spp (23). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (83), staphylococcus aureus (61), streptococcus pyogenes (27), streptococcus group d (16), and klebsiella pneumoniae (16). the types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). s. aureus was isolated at all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck  wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). this study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == bacterially preexposed t cells impair bacterial elimination by non-th1/th2 cell mechanisms in a model of intra-abdominal infection.
AB  == background: escherichia coli preexposure in mice results in impaired elimination  of subsequent intra-abdominal infections by a cd+4 t cell-dependent process. certain gram-negative infections have been shown to induce t-helper-(th)2 type cd4+ t-cell differentiation, which correlates with impaired elimination of infection and death. we hypothesized that e coli preexposure impairs subsequent bacterial elimination as a consequence of th2 differentiation and that interleukin-12 (il-12) treatment could reverse this differentiation and minimize  the effects of e coli preexposure. methods: after preexposure to e coli or other  species, balb/c mice or interferon-gamma (inf-gamma)-deficient mice, treated with or without il-12, were given a standard intra-abdominal infection (e coli, bacteroides fragilis, and adjuvant). cohorts were killed for abscess quantification, in vitro t-cell proliferative responsiveness, and cytokine secretory profiles. splenic lymphocytes preexposed in vivo to other types of bacteria were transferred to naive mice before intra-abdominal infection to determine whether preexposure, eliciting the lymphocyte-dependent response, was species specific. results: e coli preexposure alone caused no th1 or th2 shift; increased the proliferative responses of t cells; and, in combination with il-12  therapy, caused markedly decreased il-2 and il-4 responses and an increased ifn-gamma response. il-12 therapy did not change the response to intra-abdominal  infection despite its ability to cause marked th1 polarization. ifn-gamma-deficient mice responded to e coli preexposure no differently than did  wild-type mice. transfer of lymphocytes preexposed to pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and hemolytic e coli but not other types of nosocomial pathogens caused the development of more abscesses just as transfer of e coli preexposed lymphocytes had. conclusions: cd4+ t cells responsive to e coli preexposure regulate subsequent intra-abdominal abscess formation by a mechanism  not explained by the th1/th2 paradigm. preexposure to hemolytic e coli and other  enterobacteriaceae alters responses to intra-abdominal infection.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  == the goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. a total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. the malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and  candida spp. in 10 (1%). a total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), peptostreptococcus spp. (166), prevotella spp. (106), clostridium spp. (70), and fusobacterium spp. (43). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (133), staphylococcus aureus (100), klebsiella pneumoniae (48),  and pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). the type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds  and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). s. aureus and peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (prevotella and fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). this retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose piperacillin-tazobactam regimens.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h and 4.5 g every 8 h) were evaluated at steady state for 12 healthy adult volunteers. inhibitory and bactericidal activities for the two regimens were determined with five american type culture collection (atcc) organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis). the percentage of  time that plasma concentrations remained above the mic (t > mic) for each organism and dosage regimen was calculated. areas under the inhibitory (auic0-24) and bactericidal activity (aubc0-24) curves were calculated with the trapezoidal  rule by using the reciprocal of the inhibitory and bactericidal titers determined for each dosage regimen. in order to assess the validity of predicted measures of bactericidal (auc0-24/mbc) and inhibitory (auc0-24/mic) activity to determine bacteriological response to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic values were compared with measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. total body clearance values were equivalent for piperacillin (183.96 +/- 22.66 versus 181.72 +/- 19.54 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) and tazobactam (184.71 +/- 19.89 versus 184.87 +/- 18.35 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) following the administration of the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h dosages, respectively. comparison of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc0-24) for piperacillin (967.74 +/- 135.56 microg x h/ml versus 978.88 +/- 140.96 microg x h/ml) and tazobactam (120.14 +/- 15.78 microg x h/ml versus 120.01 +/- 16.22 microg x h/ml) revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h regimens, respectively. both regimens provided t > mic values of > 60% for all organisms tested. measured values of bactericidal (aubc) and inhibitory (auic) activity were significantly different (p < 0.05) from predicted values (auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic) for all  organisms studied with the exception of the bactericidal activity for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. additionally, atcc organisms possessing the same mics and mbcs exhibited great differences in measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. reasons for this difference may be inherent differences in organism specific susceptibility.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against common intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == the activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against pathogens usually involved in intra-abdominal infections was studied. metronidazole 1 g and ceftriaxone 1 g  (as the sodium salt) were simultaneously administered i.v. over 30 minutes every  24 hours to 12 healthy volunteers for three doses. serum samples were collected at baseline, just before the last dose, and 12, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours after the start of infusion of the last dose. serum bactericidal titers (sbts) were performed in duplicate for each serum sample from 12 hours on. serum ceftriaxone  and metronidazole concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the elimination rate and half-life were calculated for each antimicrobial in each volunteer. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of  each antibiotic for two strains each of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis were determined by microdilution. eleven volunteers completed the study. ceftriaxone and metronidazole maintained sbts of at least 1:4. serum ceftriaxone concentrations remained above the mics for e. coli, p. mirabilis, and k. pneumoniae, and serum metronidazole concentrations remained above the mic for b. fragilis throughout the study. ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole resulted in intense and prolonged activity against e. coli, p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae, and b. fragilis.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  == the antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, dtic, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin g, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-fc, and amphotericin b were studied on 57 bacterial strains. the bacterial species investigated were escherischia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. the antineoplastic drugs were diluted in muller-hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. for the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the pdm epsilometer test. seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents  displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. a most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased  sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.

TI  == increased resistance of encapsulated bacteroides fragilis to clindamycin.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility and in vitro growth curve of 4 nonencapsulated and 4 encapsulated isolates of bacteroides fragilis were determined for clindamycin. the mic of the nonencapsulated isolates was 1-2 dilutions less (0.062-0.25 microgram/ml) than the mic for their encapsulated counterparts (0.25-0.5 microgram/ml). no difference was noted in the bacterial growth of the nonencapsulated or encapsulated isolates when incubated without clindamycin. the  decline in the number of nonencapsulated isolates was significantly lower (p < 0.05) as compared to the encapsulated isolates when incubated with 0.1 or 0.4 microgram/ml of clindamycin. these results illustrate the higher susceptibility of nonencapsulated b. fragilis isolates to clindamycin as compared to their encapsulated counterparts. since b. fragilis becomes more encapsulated during the infectious process, this finding underscores the advantage of early antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy.

TI  == cefminox: correlation between in-vitro susceptibility and pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity in healthy volunteers.
AB  == plasma concentration of cefminox and serum bactericidal activity against four atcc strains (escherichia coli 25992, klebsiella pneumoniae 13833, serratia marcescens 8100 and bacteroides fragilis 25285), were determined over a 24 h period after administration of cefminox 1 and 2 g to six healthy volunteers in a  randomized, cross-over, single blind study. the increase observed in the area under the bactericidal curve (aubc) with the 2 g dose was at least 3.5 times that seen with the 1 g dose for all four test strains and was larger than predicted by the corresponding increase (1.84 times) in the area under the serum concentration versus time curve (auc); a correlation (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001) between the cefminox concentration and the serum bactericidal titres was, however, observed with all four strains tested. the mbc6h showed a better association with the serum bactericidal titre (p < 0.01) than did the mic or mbc.

TI  == origin and impact of plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins was originally highlighted by the emergence of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases deriving by mutation from tem-1, tem-2 and shv type enzymes (class a). the broader spectrum of resistance produced by these enzymes is related to more amino acid substitutions, but susceptibility to seven alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporins and carbapenems was preserved until recently. clavulanate-sensitive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are distributed worldwide, mainly among klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. novel clavulanate-sensitive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases deriving from other class a enzymes (e.g. men-1 from beta la oxy, oxa-11 in pseudomonas aeruginosa from pse-2) have been reported. recently, clavulanate-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (class c) were encountered amongst single isolates, mostly klebsiella pneumoniae. these cephalosporinases or cefamycinases (usually chromosomally mediated) have expanded the spectrum of plasmid-encoded resistance  to include seven alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporins. thus far, only two isolates (1 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 bacteroides fragilis), both recovered in japan, with plasmid-mediated resistance to carbapenems have been found.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == induction of the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  == the presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of bacteroides (b.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. the importance, however, of these microorganisms in  the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. therefore,  the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of b. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. prostaglandin e2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. furthermore, the camp-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. of the bacterial species tested, b. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin e2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for polymyxin b (pl-b),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since november 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. judging from the mic distribution of pl-b against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no pl-b resistant strains were detected among those gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of pl-b. 2. mics of pl-b against most strains including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. these results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of staphylococcus spp. including mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) was possible by the use of pl-b at 1 mg/ml. 3.  mic distribution of pl-b against organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group was  almost the same as the results described above.

TI  == serum and blister fluid pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activities of ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotetan, cefoxitin, ceftizoxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  == ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, cefotetan, and ceftizoxime are promoted for the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacterial infections. their activities have been compared in vitro but not in vivo. in order to assess the in vivo activities of these agents in serum and interstitial  fluid, we administered single, intravenous doses of these antimicrobial agents to healthy subjects. concentrations of the antimicrobial agents in serum and suction-induced blister fluid and bactericidal activity were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and the standard methodology of the national  committee for clinical laboratory standards, respectively. the organisms used for bactericidal activity tests were one isolate each of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. pharmacokinetic parameters in serum and blister fluid were similar to those derived in other investigations. of note were the high and prolonged concentrations of ticarcillin and cefotetan in blister fluid, despite high-level serum protein binding. the bactericidal activities in serum and blister fluid reflected the relative in vitro activities  and kinetic dispositions of the various antimicrobial agents except for the bactericidal activity of cefotetan, which was substantially lower in blister fluid than serum, despite a blister fluid:serum area under the concentration-time curve ratio of 1.5. similarly, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanate in blister fluid was also substantially less than would have been predicted by the blister fluid:serum ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of 1.1, possibly because of the low concentrations of clavulanate in blister fluid. the rankings of the in vivo bactericidal activities of the five drugs were as follows: for s.  aureus, ampicillin-sulbactam > ticarcillin-clavulanate > ceftizoxime > cefoxitin  > cefotetan; for k. pneumoniae, ceftizoxime > cefotetan > ampicillin-sulbactam =  ticarcillin-clavulanate > cefoxitin; and for b.fragilis, ticarcillin-clavulanate  > cefotetan > ceftizoxime > ampicillin-sulbactam = cefoxitin.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  == a total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml) by agar dilution method. these included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 31 of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 49 of neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of haemophilus influenzae, 112  of escherichia coli, 118 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of proteus mirabilis, 30 of proteus vulgaris, 60 of serratia marcescens, 113 of enterobacter cloacae, 60 of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of bacteroides fragilis. the results revealed that  46.6% of p. mirabilis, 53.4% of h. influenzae, 57.1% of n. gonorrhoeae, 80% of p. vulgaris, 83.9% of mrsa, 85.6% of mssa, 87.5% of e. coli, 91.7% of s. marcescens, 95.7% of b. fragilis, 98.2% of e. cloacae, and 100% of k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers.  the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of mssa, mrsa, h. influenzae, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, e. cloacae, b. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of mssa, h. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of mrsa, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and b. fragilis strains. clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. in general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against  staphylococcus aureus, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and yersinia spp.; and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both compounds were equally active against pseudomonas cepacia. the in vitro dna gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an e. coli enzyme. in vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin  in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. this study presents some potential advantages of the pure l isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: a review of its microbiology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. these include penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas spp. or bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) bacteroides spp. animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. no significant drug interactions have been noted to date. the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been  evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. in comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as  effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on  standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. however, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the mic(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. this should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses  can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. standard doses in  children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.

AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

AB  == fibrin glue is an effective hemostatic agent in a variety of clinical situations; its utility is limited by potential transmission of viral infection. we studied the bactericidal properties of fibrin gel (fg) in a murine contaminated hepatic injury model and in vitro by agar plate culture method. intra-abdominal abscess formation and adhesion rate were assessed following controlled liver injury in association with abdominal contamination with 10(7) bacteroides fragilis and hepatorrhaphy (h, n = 15) or fg (n = 12). animals treated by hepatorrhaphy had a  significantly greater intra-abdominal abscess rate (15/15 vs. 4/12, p less than 0.05) and adhesion rate (14/15 vs. 6/12, p less than 0.05) than animals treated with fg. fibrin gel is bactericidal to bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter faecium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus but has no effect against klebsiella pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa; the plasma component appears active. fibrin gel demonstrates significant improvement in adhesion formation and intra-abdominal abscess rate when compared with suture hepatorrhaphy. fibrin gel  appears protective in contaminated hepatic injury.

AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == we evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and citrobacter perfringens. synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa. some ofloxacin and  piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for s. aureus and e. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against p. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a prospective study of twenty-seven cases in cirrhotic patients.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis is a serious complication that demands urgent attention. we report here a prospective study of the treatment of  27 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 22 cirrhotic patients with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. the infection of ascitic fluid was diagnosed by  a positive culture plus an ascitic neutrophil count exceeding 75/microliters, or  by an ascitic neutrophil count exceeding 500/microliters. the infection was treated with 1 gm amoxicillin and 0.2 gm clavulanic acid every 6 hr for 14 days.  in 17 cases (63%), bacteria were isolated from the ascitic fluid. all the bacteria isolated were sensitive to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, whereas in five cases they were resistant to amoxicillin alone (escherichia coli in two cases, klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases and bacteroides fragilis in one case).  cure of the infection was achieved in 23 episodes (85%) after 14 days' treatment; 17 patients (63%) were able to leave the hospital. fourteen of 20 patients (70%)  treated for the first episode of infection died within 1 yr: eight from infection, two from gastrointestinal hemorrhage, one from infection and hemorrhage and three from tumors. one patient who had repeated infections underwent liver transplantation and has not had any infectious complications 1.5  yr after surgery. amoxicillin and clavulanic acid may be an effective first-line  therapy for ascitic fluid infection in cirrhosis. nevertheless, the 1-yr prognosis continues to be grave and the severity of the underlying liver disease  remains the most important determinant for survival.

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

TI  == effect of the abscess environment on the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the present studies were conducted to identify factors in human purulent material that might limit or enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin against bacteria causing suppurative infection. ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ampicillin were tested with regard to binding or inactivation by pus. the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were tested against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus in human pus with a  ph of 6.0 incubated at 37 degrees c under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. the effect of single or combination drug therapy with 20 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or rifampin given every 12 hours was tested against e. coli or p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic murine abscesses that had been produced by subcutaneous injection of either of those organisms mixed with bacteroides fragilis and autoclaved human stool. antibiotic levels and the number of bacteria surviving in pus were quantitated. therapy of subcutaneous abscesses was delayed  72 hours to test drug efficacy against organisms in well-established infections.  levels of ampicillin, imipenem, or ciprofloxacin were reduced from 10 micrograms/ml to 3.1 +/- 4.0, 2.7 +/- 3, or 5.8 +/- 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, after incubation in eight pus specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees  c. ampicillin levels were reduced to less than 1 microgram/ml in four pus specimens containing beta-lactamase. imipenem levels were undetectable in two specimens and were 0.2 micrograms/ml in one specimen. ciprofloxacin binding to pus supernate or sediment appeared to be explained by its binding to the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) present in pus. activity of 5 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin against four e. coli or k. pneumoniae strains in pus in vitro was greater than that of twofold higher concentrations of imipenem. the bactericidal  activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were comparable but substantially reduced  against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in pus. ciprofloxacin alone or regimens combining ciprofloxacin with rifampin or rifampin plus imipenem reduced the number of e. coli in polymicrobic subcutaneous abscesses but had little effect on p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic abscesses. the anaerobic abscess milieu appeared to inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin activity in abscess fluid did  not appear to be adversely affected by acid ph, aerobic or anaerobic conditions of incubation, the abscess constituents, or the binding of ciprofloxacin to the dna in pus. ciprofloxacin was bound to dna of bacterial or human origin. binding  by pus was reversible, and binding to dna extracts of pus was blocked by pretreatment of extracts with deoxyribonuclease but not by pretreatment with ribonuclease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr-830h), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. piperacillin mics were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2  or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. the higher concentration was generally  more effective. tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. mics were reduced to the susceptible range for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp.,  salmonella spp., and shigella spp. combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against morganella spp. some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. the inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive staphylococcus spp. and the bacteroides fragilis group. piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a  broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. in  particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1 enzymes. in vitro activity was reflected in vivo. tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the morganella infection. tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of qa-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to qa-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. the mics of qa-241 for 90% of staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of qa-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. at the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, qa-241 inhibited 90% of haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii. qa-241 was moderately active (mic for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against s. marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. the antibacterial activity of qa-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. in systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of qa-241 was  generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and  ciprofloxacin. in urinary tract infections in mice with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa, qa-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. in pulmonary infections in mice with klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of qa-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == penetration of third-generation cephalosporins into human peritoneal tissue.
AB  == each of 40 patients underwent elective laparotomy following administration of a single 1.0-gram intravenous dose of ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone or cefotaxime. therapeutic concentrations of cefoperazone and ceftriaxone were achieved in peritoneal tissue in 20/20 patients. only 9/20 samples from patients  receiving the other two antibiotics had detectable antibiotic activity. the antibiotic concentration in peritoneal fluid (7 samples) was 2.36-11.15 times higher than that of concurrently obtained peritoneal tissue. when adjusted for the in vitro susceptibility (mic) of potential peritoneal pathogens, our data suggest that ceftriaxone and cefoperazone may be preferable to other third-generation cephalosporins for the prophylaxis and therapy of intraabdominal infection.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of seven strains of anaerobic and  facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc), seven aerobic and facultative organisms, and two bacteroides spp. commonly isolated with afgpc in mixed infection was evaluated. enhancement was studied by measuring the relative increase in the colony-forming units of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. of the 56 combinations, afgpc were enhanced in 6 and inhibited in 1. the aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 32 of the 42 combinations and depressed in none. the bacteroides spp. were enhanced in 12 of the 14 combinations and suppressed in none. the organisms uniformly enhanced by afgpc were group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis (all seven instances), followed by escherichia coli (six of seven instances), bacteroides asaccharolyticus and klebsiella pneumoniae (five instances each), staphylococcus aureus (four instances), and group d streptococci (three instances). it is apparent that in mixed infection with afgpc the rate of growth  of bacteroides spp. and facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more than the rate of growth of afgpc.

TI  == comparative susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone:  1981 to 1987.
AB  == it has been postulated that the widespread use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins might lead to increased bacterial resistance to such agents. to determine if such increased resistance to cefoperazone might be detectable, the susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone were examined from the pathology laboratories at baptist medical center, jacksonville, florida, from 1981, prior to approval by the food and drug administration, to the present. gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, staphylococci, and members of the bacteroides fragilis group were included in the analysis. the data obtained were compared with results of similar published studies nationwide. no significant decrease in susceptibility to cefoperazone was detected for any gram-negative species examined. a steady increase in the percentage of staphylococci (both coagulase positive and especially coagulase negative) resistant to cefoperazone was demonstrable at this institution. this was a direct function of the concomitant rise in the percentages of staphylococci resistant to methicillin observed over the testing interval. anaerobic susceptibility patterns of the members of the b. fragilis group were also relatively constant during this period of time. the concentrations of antibiotic inhibiting 50 percent (mic50) and 90 percent (mic90) of b. fragilis isolates as determined by an agar dilution  technique were 16 micrograms/ml and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, both in 1981  and in 1987. no change in the national susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to cefoperazone was demonstrable in the five-year period during which the antibiotic has been available for clinical use.

TI  == ciprofloxacin: in vitro, experimental, and clinical evaluation.
AB  == ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml inhibited the growth of approximately 90% of 584 strains of aerobic bacteria isolated from cultures of blood drawn from septicemic patients. an increase in the inoculum size did not result in an increased mic, but serial passages through media containing ciprofloxacin at sub-mic levels increased the mic for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus vulgaris. in experimental subcutaneous abscesses in the mouse model, ciprofloxacin was more active than cefotaxime against a mixed infection induced with e. coli and bacteroides fragilis. against  mixed e. coli and staphylococcus aureus infection, no significant differences were noted between the two drugs. in a double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical study, perorally administered ciprofloxacin was compared with intravenously administered cefotaxime in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections severe enough to require hospitalization. in 70 patients treated, the  therapeutic efficacy of peroral ciprofloxacin was comparable to that of intravenous cefotaxime, with two differences: s. aureus infections responded less favorably to oral ciprofloxacin (62%) than to intravenous cefotaxime (90%), and aerobic gram-negative bacillary infections responded more favorably to ciprofloxacin (92%) than to cefotaxime (64%).

AB  == chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) in response to cell components  of bacteroides fragilis alone or in combination with escherichia coli was evaluated. e. coli produced much more powerful chemotactic factors than b. fragilis. the culture filtrate (cf), outer membrane (om) preparation, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of b. fragilis slightly stimulated chemotactic activity  of pmnl. the culture filtrate and om preparation were capable of inhibiting the chemotaxis of pmnl in response to the chemotactic factors of e. coli but lps of b. fragilis was not able to do so. reduction by b. fragilis of pmnl chemotaxis in response to e. coli was not specific for b. fragilis but also occurred in the presence of facultative bacteria. in parallel with chemotaxis, lysozyme release,  but not beta-glucuronidase release, by pmnl was significantly stimulated by e. coli but not by b. fragilis.

TI  == use of d-lactic acid measurements in the diagnosis of bacterial infections.
AB  == this study explored the use of d-lactic acid as a marker for bacterial infections. d-lactic was produced by frequently encountered human bacterial pathogens under anaerobic growth conditions; bacteroides fragilis produced the largest amount. orally administered d-lactic acid was absorbed from the intestines of rats and later found in measurable quantities in the blood and urine. eunephric and anephric rats that received d-lactic acid intravenously showed similar quantities of this metabolite in the blood. these quantities are consistent with the distribution of d-lactic acid to total body water. isolated liver and lung tissues from rats did not metabolize or produce d-lactic acid. rats with experimentally induced, sublethal klebsiella peritonitis had d-lactic acidemia of 0.2 mm and 25.6 mm at 0 and 6 hr of infection, respectively. in a normal human, d-lactic acid was detected in the urine and blood after a subcutaneous injection of d-lactic acid, and pharmacokinetics of elimination similar to those of rats were found.

TI  == [clinical trials of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. in many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of escherichia coli, and recently, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. the distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. results of our trials are summarized below: of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the  efficacy ratio of 89%. no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis is a silent pathogen in acute appendicitis.
AB  == the role of bacteroides fragilis in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis was studied in 135 patients in four patient groups: normal (17); phlegmonous appendicitis (17); gangrenous appendicitis (75); and septic complications of appendicitis (26). aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all groups and members of the 'b. fragilis group' were the most common anaerobic isolates. the rate of isolation of b. fragilis was similar from normal and inflamed appendices but was significantly higher from those with septic complications (p less than 0.01). antibodies against b. fragilis were demonstrated in patients of  all groups and occurred with similar frequencies in patients with normal and inflamed appendices but at a significantly higher rate in those with septic complications (p less than 0.01). whereas patients in this latter group showed igm-antibody responses to b. fragilis only, those with acute appendicitis had igm antibodies against a wide range of organisms of the 'b. fragilis group' which suggests that b. fragilis does not play a significant role in acute appendicitis  but may be a major cause of its septic complications.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

AB  == fosfomycin (fom) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. it has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. as therapy, fom-na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g x 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). the clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. no adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted  of 4 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  bacteroides fragilis. the mics of fom were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for e. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for k. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for b. fragilis.  fom-na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. the fom concentration was determined by bioassay with a proteus sp. (mb 838) as the test organism. the mean fom concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after fom-na intravenous bolus injection. the mean fom concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. the mean fom concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. the fom concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the mics of  fom for the pathogenic bacteria. therefore, fom-na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

AB  == using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas species. unlike many newer beta-lactams, sch 34343 was highly active  against gram-positive species. it was consistently active against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic50 and mic90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). this, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. sch 34343 was the most active compound tested  against bacteroides fragilis. in tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. it had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. it showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at ph values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees c. binding in human plasma was 72%. we concluded  that sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.

TI  == [cefminox concentration in tissues and clinical efficacy of cefminox in acute peritonitis].
AB  == cefminox sodium (cmnx, mt-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii, cmnx has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. for therapeutic purpose, cmnx was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g x  1) to 2 g (1 x 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). the clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. no adverse effect was observed. there were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 escherichia coli, some enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. these isolated organisms were eradicated after cmnx treatment, except a strain of e. faecalis was decreased. in 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, cmnx was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body  fluids samples were taken during the operation. cmnx concentration was determined to a bioassay with escherichia coli nihj or vibrio vercolans atcc 8461 as the test organisms. cmnx concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). cmnx concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. in the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, cmnx levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. therefore, cmnx sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.

TI  == effects of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis on peritoneal host defenses.
AB  == escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis are common copathogens in clinical intra-abdominal sepsis, yet it is unclear how they interact synergistically in vivo. we sought to determine whether e. coli and b. fragilis, in combination but  not alone, could exert a detrimental effect on the peritoneal host defenses of translymphatic absorption and bacterial phagocytosis. our data indicated that nonviable e. coli (o18ab:k56/k7:- and o111:b4), klebsiella pneumoniae, b. fragilis, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were handled in a similar fashion by both host defenses of the peritoneal cavity. the use of 2 x 10(8) nonviable radiolabeled e. coli as a tracer and either 2 x 10(9) b. fragilis or 2 x 10(9) e. coli (either viable or nonviable) as a competing agent to inhibit host defenses demonstrated that although clearance and phagocytosis could be inhibited, the inhibition occurred to a similar degree with either e. coli or b. fragilis. thus, b. fragilis did not compete to any greater extent than e. coli did for peritoneal clearance or opsonization and phagocytosis in vivo. these data indicate that bacterial synergy probably does not occur on the basis of reduced peritoneal clearance or by a reduction in the opsonization and phagocytosis of either organism by the copathogen. these results provide indirect support for the hypothesis that in bacterial synergy, one organism directly stimulates the growth of the other, perhaps by providing a growth factor.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == aztreonam in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host  defenses.
AB  == a clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  aztreonam in hospital-acquired infections. twenty patients (13 men and 7 women) with impaired host defenses and nosocomial infections were treated with aztreonam at a dosage ranging 4 and 6 g/day i.v. at 8 or 12-hour intervals. average length  of therapy was 10.35 +/- 4.61 days. the isolated organisms were as follows: escherichia coli (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), enterobacter cloacae (1), proteus mirabilis (2), proteus vulgaris (1), acinetobacter anitratus (1), serratia marcescens (1), citrobacter freundii (1), bacteroides fragilis (3), bacteroides melaninogenicus (1). in 5 patients (25%) a  mixed infection was observed. sixteen patients (80%) were completely cured from infection and 24 isolated organisms (88.8%) were eradicated. no adverse reactions were observed. aztreonam has undoubtedly high clinical and bacteriological efficacy in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host defenses.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. the pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against candida albicans. there was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity was dialyzable and ph dependent, but independent of heat,  the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. electron micrographs of escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. the antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. it is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.

AB  == in vitro susceptibility of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, hemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. in general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria gonorrhea. they also tend to be active against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis. however, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. these cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  == cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. it inhibited haemophilus and neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime,  moxalactam, or ceftazidime against escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia spp., and serratia spp. cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type i beta-lactamases.

TI  == prostaglandin cytoprotection and lysosomal stability in acute canine gastric erosions.
AB  == prostaglandin cytoprotection may be related to lysosomal stability. in six mongrel dogs, bacterial peritonitis was created by the intraperitoneal instillation of bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae in addition to canine gallbladder bile. in three dogs, gallbladder bile alone was instilled. three of the six dogs with bacterial peritonitis also received 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin e2 (pge2) (0.2 micrograms/kg intramuscularly q6h) 24 hours before and for 3 days after the induction of peritonitis. in the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving pge2, gastroscopic examination demonstrated acute fundic erosions. none of the other dogs developed acute gastric erosions. in the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving pge2, fundic mucosal biopsy specimens demonstrated decreased lysosomal stability. in the dogs receiving pge2, lysosomal stability was similar to that in the animals with bile peritonitis. these experiments demonstrate that pge2 prevents the development of acute gastric erosions by stabilizing lysosomal membranes.

AB  == six transtracheal aspirations (tta) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria  and tta aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. differences in bacteria isolated in tta and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. six isolates  were recovered in both sites (three pseudomonas aeruginosa, two staphylococcus aureus and one aspergillus flavus). five aerobic isolates were recovered only in  the expectorated sputum and not in tta aspirations (two klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). nine organisms were isolated only from the tta (two each of veillonella parvula and alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, lactobacillus sp., haemophilus influenzae and gamma hemolytic streptococci). the recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six tta specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. we found tta to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == comparative review of two new wide-spectrum penicillins: mezlocillin and piperacillin.
AB  == the antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (mezlin) and piperacillin (pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. following  i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. however, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. piperacillin is also effective for bone and  joint infections. dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. the potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their  extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. more comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

AB  == aspiration pneumonia in adults has been shown to involve anaerobes about 90% of the time. studies of the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children done in the past have either failed to exclude the oral and upper respiratory tract flora or have not utilized proper anaerobic culture techniques or both. in the present  study. 74 institutionalized children with aspiration pneumonia were studied by percutaneous transtracheal aspiration. their average age was 8 years. fifty-two patients had pneumonitis, 12, necrotizing pneumonia, and 10, lung abscess. only one patient (with lung abscess) had a complicating empyema. there was an average  of five bacteria isolated per specimen--2.8 anaerobes and 2.2 nonanaerobes. the predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and fuso-bacteria; there were ten patients who yielded members of the bacteroides fragilis group. the predominant nonanaerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. thus, aspiration pneumonia in children, as in adults, commonly involves anaerobic bacteria. when aspiration occurs in a medical institution, nosocomial pathogens which are aerobic or facultative will also often be involved, in both children and adults.

TI  == vein reconstruction of a mycotic internal carotid aneurysm.
AB  == carotid aneurysms are an extremely rare entity; mycotic carotid aneurysms are even more uncommon. most articles in the past have advocated ligation as treatment of mycotic carotid aneurysms due to the dangers of graft placement in an infected field. unfortunately, stroke occurs in many patients so treated. as the cerebral complications were so high, bypass using autogenous vein and fine monofilament polypropylene sutures is attractive. this technique was used in a patient having a mycotic carotid aneurysm who was referred to the vascular service of the shands teaching hospital. pre- and postoperative antibiotics, resection of the aneurysm, anastomosis in a noninfected area, and long-term oral  antibiotics were felt to be other important aspects of the patient's treatment. this individual is well one year after operation without neurological sequelae. this case suggests that if strict operative and therapeutic guidelines are observed, bypass with autogenous vein is a feasible operative alternative in patients having mycotic carotid aneurysms. the risk of this procedure must be carefully weighed against the devastating neurological sequellae that might result with ligation.

AB  == the bacteriology and clinical findings of ten pediatric patients with lung abscess are presented. bacteriologic data were based on percutaneous transtracheal aspiration obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy. anaerobic bacteria were present in all ten patients; in nine they were mixed with aerobic bacteria. the most frequent isolates were peptostreptococcus (8), peptococcus (5), bacteroides melaninogenicus (6), and bacteroides fragilis (3). the aerobic isolates most frequently recovered were alpha-hemolytic streptococci  (5), group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (4), and escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). virtually all abscesses were located in dependent pulmonary  segments. antimicrobial therapy was guided by the bacteriologic findings and was  successful in all instances.

TI  == endotoxin in germfree, gnotobiotic, or conventional-flora sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == the limulus assay for bacterial endotoxin was performed on serum and (or) plasma  from animals monoassociated with clostridium species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter agglomerans, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, or candida albicans. plasma from animals monoassociated with the gram-negative bacteria or c. albicans consistently showed a positive limulus test while conventional-flora controls, germfree rats, and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with gram-positive bacteria or e. agglomerans  were negative. germfree and conventional rats were injected (intraperitoneal (i.p.)) with salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (lps). although no endotoxin was detectable in either group prior to the injection, by 1 h post injection endotoxin was in the plasma of all groups. the germfree rats appeared to clear the lps quicker than their conventional-flora counterparts. generally, lps-injected rats (conventional and germfree) showed clumping and decreased number of platelets, a decrease in their lymphocyte counts, and increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) counts.

TI  == susceptibility of the anaerobic bacteria, group d streptococci, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas to semisynthetic penicillins: carbenicillin,  piperacillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  == sodium piperacillin t-1220, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was tested in vitro against 297 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and 669 aerobic bacteria by the conventional agar dilution method and compared with carbenicillin and ticarcillin. at a 100-mug/ml concentration the three drugs showed comparable effectiveness against the anaerobes tested. however, at 20 mug/ml, piperacillin was the most effective drug against bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococci, and  group d streptococci. at this drug concentration only 48% of the b. fragilis strains exhibited susceptibility to carbenicillin only, 64% exhibited susceptibility to ticarcillin but 90% exhibited susceptibility to piperacillin. similar findings were observed with peptostreptococci and group d streptococci. on a weight basis piperacillin was statistically shown to be the most effective antibiotic of the three tested against these anaerobes. at 20 mug/ml, piperacillin exhibited a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) over carbenicillin and ticarcillin for serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas isolates, and citrobacter  diversus. at both 20- and 100-mug/ml concentrations, piperacillin appeared to be  the most effective (calculated p < 0.01) upon klebsiella species, k. pneumoniae,  s. marcescens, and c. freundii in activity over ticarcillin and carbenicillin.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of bl-s786 compared with those of  other cephalosporins.
AB  == in vitro activity of bl-s786, a new parenterally semisynthetic cephalosporin, was investigated against 570 bacterial isolates. bl-s786 inhibited most escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella. it inhibited some enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, but it was less active against these later species than was cefamandole, cefuroxime, or cefoxitin. it was not active against serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or bacteroides fragilis. bl-s786 was the least active new cephalosporin tested against staphylococci and was less active than cephalothin against streptococcal species. the activity of bl-s786 was not altered by the type of assay medium nor by 50% serum. the size of the test inoculum altered the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations  for inhibition of some organisms, particularly those with richmond type i beta-lactamases. bl-s786 was not hydrolyzed by the r-factor-mediated, richmond type iii beta-lactamase, but it was hydrolyzed by type i beta-lactamases.

TI  == in vitro studies of piperacilin, a new semisynthetic penicillin.
AB  == piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was compared with other semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides by the agar dilution method against 3,600 isolates of facultative gram-negative bacilli, bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci. at 64 mug/ml, piperacillin inhibited 90% of the isolates in each group of organisms tested except for escherichia coli (83% inhibited by 64 mug/ml). compared with carbenicillin, piperacillin had a 16-fold increase in activity by weight against pseudomonas aeruginosa and the enterococcus, an 8-fold increase against serratia marcescens, and a 4-fold increase against b. fragilis and enterobacter species. piperacillin was highly active against carbenicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and inhibited many aminoglycoside-resistant organisms. except for p. aeruginosa, the minimum bactericidal concentration of piperacillin was usually within one tube dilution of the minimum inhibitory concentration. approximately one-third of the gram-negative bacilli were inhibited synergistically by piperacillin plus amikacin, but no synergy could be demonstrated against enterococci. piperacillin's in vitro activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to gentamicin's except that it also included b. fragilis, and piperacillin was decidedly superior to presently available penicillins against k. pneumoniae.

TI  == differences between cephalothin and newer parenterally absorbed cephalosporins in vitro: a justification for separate disks.
AB  == the activities of cefamandole and cefoxitin in vitro were compared with that of cephalothin against staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli. cephalothin was the  most active agent against staphylococci. cefamandole exhibited the greatest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, with the exceptions of serratia marcescens and indole-positive proteeae, against which cefoxitin was the most active antibiotic. the activity of newer cephalosporins that are resistant to the beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria renders untenable the status of cephalothin as the class representative of the cephalosporins for susceptibility  testing.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology in head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  == a prospective study of wound infections following major head and neck cancer surgery was undertaken to define a rational approach to trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and initial therapy of these infections. preoperative aerobic cultures were taken from the planned site of skin incision and from the oropharynx. both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from all wound infections. patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics were excluded from the study. the data indicate that preoperative cultures are not usually predictive of the bacteriology of subsequent wound infection. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were cultured from most wound infections, and usually reflected normal anaerobic  oropharyngeal flora, exogenously acquired staphylococcus aureus, or both. bacteroides fragilis was not cultured in this series. antibiotics selected for trials of prophylaxis or initial treatment of these infections should cover both  the resident oral aerobic and anaerobic flora and s aureus. coverage for b fragilis does not appear necessary. antibiotic choices might include penicillin g plus a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a parenteral cephalosporin.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  == inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the who-ics agar dilution technique. cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, haemophilus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. none of these cephalosporins was active against enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteeae, pseudomonas, or  bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == clindamycin plus gentamicin as expectant therapy for presumed mixed infections.
AB  == the prevalence of obligate anaerobes was studied prospectively in 60 patients with severe sepsis of intra-abdominal, soft tissue, female genital or oropulmonary origin. in addition, the efficacy of clindamycin (for anaerobes) plus gentamicin (for aerobic bacteria, especially coliforms) as initial empiric therapy in these patients was evaluated. among 54 patients with cultural proof of infection, anaerobic pathogens were recovered from 52%. nineteen patients had bacteremia; bacteroides fragilis and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most prevalent pathogens, being isolated in five patients each. infection was eradicated in 56 of the 60 patients (93%). mortality related to sepsis was 7% in  the entire group, 16% in patients with bacteremia and 2% in patients without bacteremia. eighty-five percent of aerobic isolates tested were susceptible in vitro to either gentamicin or clindamycin; 97% of anaerobic isolates were inhibited by 5 mug/ml of clindamycin.

TI  == pc-904, a novel broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin with marked antipseudomonal activity: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == pc-904, sodium 6-{d(-)-alpha-(4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carboxamido) phenylacetamido}-penicillanate, is a novel semisynthetic penicillin derivative that possesses a broad spectrum of in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities. in low concentrations, pc-904 inhibits growth against large proportions of the gram-positive and gram-negative organisms susceptible to carbenicillin and gentamicin. in addition, pc-904 is several times more potent than carbenicillin against organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, shigella, salmonella, neisseria gonorrhoeae,  and bacteroides fragilis. most striking are the inhibitory effects of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. against these two clinical isolates, pc-904 is, respectively, 35 and 100 times more active than carbenicillin. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa are comparable  to those of gentamicin. pc-904 acts bactericidally. the effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity is often small and generally comparable to carbenicillin. the rate of binding to serum protein is high (88 to 98%), but the  effect of the addition of serum on the drug's activity is not marked, because such binding is reversible. it is confirmed that pc-904 has a very potent in vivo antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. against systemic infections with p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli in mice, pc-904 is 7 to 10 times, over 8 times, and 2 to 15 times more active than carbenicillin, respectively.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.
