TI  == bacterial zoonoses of fishes: a review and appraisal of evidence for linkages between fish and human infections.
AB  == human contact with and consumption of fishes presents hazards from a range of bacterial zoonotic infections. whereas many bacterial pathogens have been presented as fish-borne zoonoses on the basis of epidemiological and phenotypic evidence, genetic identity between fish and human isolates is not frequently examined or does not provide support for transmission between these hosts. in order to accurately assess the zoonotic risk from exposure to fishes in the context of aquaculture, wild fisheries and ornamental aquaria, it is important to critically examine evidence of linkages between bacteria infecting fishes and humans. this article reviews bacteria typically presented as fish-borne zoonoses, and examines the current strength of evidence for this classification. of bacteria generally described as fish-borne zoonoses, only mycobacterium spp., streptococcus iniae, clostridium botulinum, and vibrio vulnificus appear to be well-supported as zoonoses in the strict sense. erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, while transmissible from fishes to humans, does not cause disease in fishes and is therefore excluded from the list. some epidemiological and/or molecular linkages have been made between other bacteria infecting both fishes and humans,  but more work is needed to elucidate routes of transmission and the identity of these pathogens in their respective hosts at the genomic level.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == streptolysin s-like virulence factors: the continuing saga.
AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a potent cytolytic toxin and virulence factor that is produced by nearly all streptococcus pyogenes strains. despite a 100-year history of research on this toxin, it has only recently been established that sls is just one of an extended family of post-translationally modified virulence factors (the sls-like peptides) that are produced by some streptococci and other gram-positive pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum. in this review, we describe the identification, genetics, biochemistry and various functions of sls. we also discuss the shared features of the virulence-associated sls-like peptides, as well as their place within the rapidly expanding family of  thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins (tomms).

TI  == clostridiolysin s, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from clostridium botulinum.
AB  == through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in c. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin s, a key virulence factor from group a streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass  spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin s-like gene cluster from clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin s.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == listeriolysin s, a novel peptide haemolysin associated with a subset of lineage i listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of group a streptococcus (gas), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. although it has long been thought that sls and related peptides are produced by gas and related streptococci only, there is evidence to  suggest that a number of the most notorious gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum and staphylococcus aureus, produce related peptides. the distribution of the l. monocytogenes cluster is particularly noteworthy in that it is found exclusively among a subset of lineage i strains; i.e., those responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic  and cytotoxic factor, designated listeriolysin s, which contributes to virulence  of the pathogen as assessed by murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. thus, in the process of establishing the existence of an extended family of sls-like modified virulence peptides (mvps), the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of lineage i l. monocytogenes may have been revealed.

TI  == rac1, rhoa, and cdc42 participate in hela cell invasion by group b streptococcus.
AB  == the group b streptococcus (gbs) is an important human pathogen with the ability to cause invasive disease. to do so, the bacteria must invade host cells. it has  been well documented that gbs are able to invade a variety of nonphagocytic host  cell types, and this process is thought to involve a number of pathogen-host cell interactions. while some of the molecular aspects of the gbs-host cell invasion process have been characterized, many events still remain unclear. the objective  of this investigation was to evaluate the role of the rho-family gtpases rac, rho, and cdc42 in gbs invasion into epithelial cells. the epithelial cell invasion process was modeled using hela 229 cell culture. treatment of hela cells with 10 microm compactin, a pan-gtpase inhibitor, abolished gbs internalization,  suggesting that gtpases are involved in the gbs invasion process. the addition of toxin b or exoenzyme c3 to hela cells before gbs infection reduced invasion by 50%, further suggesting that the rho-family gtpases are involved in gbs entry. examining invasion of gbs into hela cells with altered genetic backgrounds was used to confirm these findings; gbs invasion into hela cells transiently transfected with dominant negative rac1, cdc42, or rhoa reduced invasion by 75%,  51%, and 42%, respectively. results of this study suggest that the rho-family gtpases are required for efficient invasion of hela cells by gbs.

TI  == [foodborne infections and intoxications in poland in 2004].
AB  == a total of 19 870 bacterial foodborne infections and intoxications were registered in 2004 (incidence 52.0/100,000 population). these illnesses were less incident in 2004, compared both to 2003 figure (20 221 cases) and the median 1998-2002 (26 734 cases). unlike bacterial infections, the incidence of viral foodborne infections increased in the recent years (2004 - 27.2 vs. 2003 -21.1 and median 1998-2002 - 10.0). the parasitic foodborne infections did not change much during the recent years. a total of 156 cases of mushroom poisonings were reported (incidence 0,4) in 2004, compared to 78 cases in 2003, 66 cases in 2002  and a median of 223 cases in 1998-2001 (incidence 0.6). there were 13 deaths related to foodborne infections or intoxications registered in 2004, of which the following etiologic agents were established: salmonella enteritidis (2) clostridium botulinum (2), streptococcus aureus (1), other bacteria (6), and e. multilocularis infestation (2). a total of 347 foodborne and waterborne outbreaks involving 5 920 cases were reported in 2004 (only outbreaks involving 4 persons or more). the most prevalent etiological factors in outbreaks were salmonella strains (50.0% of cases), staphylococcus aureus (6.5% of cases) and escherichia coli (4.6% of cases). in 28% of outbreaks involving 31.2% cases no etiological factor was established. the most prevalent salmonella strain were s. enteritidis  (95,1% cases) and s. typhimurium (1.7%). the main vehicle of foodborne and waterborne outbreaks were meals prepared from various (>2) raw materials of animal sources (33.1% of cases) and meals from eggs (20.3%). of the places of food contamination, the most prevalent were own apartments (24.8% of outbreaks),  food producing farms (8,1%), and restaurants (8,1%). the three largest outbreaks  (two caused by s. enteritidis and one by s. aureus) involved 576 cases, of which  26 were hospitalized.

TI  == neurological syndromes among horses in the netherlands. a 5 year retrospective survey (1999-2004).
AB  == the presence of toxins or infectious agents combined with environmental factors in combination with a susceptible host can be the cause for neurological disease  in groups of horses. during a 5 year observational period outbreaks of neurological diseases among horses were evaluated. causes of occurring neurological diseases were equine botulism, lolitrem intoxications, equine herpesvirus type 1-associated myelo(encephalo)pathy, and encephalitis caused by (disseminated) streptococcus equi subspecies equi infection. this article focuses on the first three syndromes because of their predominant influence on locomotion. the pathogenesis of each disease is presented, followed by a description of a general presentation of the diseases as encountered under dutch  circumstances.

TI  == identification of spya, a novel adp-ribosyltransferase of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, the aetiological agent of both respiratory and skin infections, produces numerous exotoxins to establish infection. this report identifies a new exotoxin produced by this organism, termed spya, for s. pyogenesadp-ribosylating toxin. spya, mw 24.9, has amino acid identity with the adp-riboslytransferases (adprts) staphylococcus aureus edin and clostridium botulinum c3. recombinant spya was able to hydrolyse beta-nad(+), and this activity was dependent on a glutamate at position 187. spya has a putative biglutamate active site, and similar to most biglutamate adprts, was able to adp-ribosylate poly-l-arginine. spya modified numerous proteins in both cho and hela cell lysates. two-dimesional gel analysis and maldi-tof ms analysis of modified proteins indicated that vimentin, tropomyosin and actin, all cytoskeletal proteins, are targets. expression of spya in hela cells resulted in  loss of actin microfilaments. we hypothesize that spya is produced by s. pyogenes to disrupt cytoskeletal structures and promote colonization of the host.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == the effect of ph and a bacteriocin (bovicin hc5) on clostridium sporogenes md1, a bacterium that has the ability to degrade amino acids in ensiled plant materials.
AB  == fresh plant materials can be fermented and preserved as silage for cattle, but clostridia that deaminate amino acids increase ph. if the ph of the silage rises, spoilage microorganisms proliferate, and undesirable products accumulate. rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria with spores were isolated from fresh alfalfa, fresh corn, and silages. strain md1 had the highest specific activity of amino acid deamination, and it was most closely related to clostridium botulinum a and  b. however, because strain md1 did not produce a toxin, it was classified as clostridium sporogenes. washed cell suspensions of c. sporogenes md1 had specific activities as great as 690 nmol ammonia mg protein(-1) min(-1), and this rate did not decrease until the ph was less than 4.5. batch cultures of c. sporogenes md1  did not initiate growth if the initial ph was less than 5.0, but continuous cultures (0.1 h(-1) dilution rate) persisted until the ph in the culture vessel was 4.6. when c. sporogenes md1 was co-cultured with a bacteriocin-producing streptococcus bovis hc5, ammonia production was greatly reduced. the ability of s. bovis hc5 to inhibit strain md1 was ph-dependent. when the ph was 5.5 or less, strain md1 could no longer be detected. these latter results support the idea that bacteriocin-producing bacteria may be used to improve silage quality.

TI  == isolation, characterization and comparison of bacteria from swine faeces and manure storage pits.
AB  == storage of swine manure is associated with the microbiological production of a variety of odorous chemicals including ammonia, organic acids and alcohols, and sulphides. although largely the product of microbiological activity, little is known about the microorganisms present in swine manure. in order to gain a better understanding of the types and activities of the microorganisms present, representative strains of microorganisms were isolated from faeces and stored manure slurry, identified, and physiologically characterized. for swine manure slurry samples, total anaerobe colony counts were greatest when a non-selective,  habitat simulating medium containing clarified swine manure slurry was used whereas the highest counts for faecal anaerobes were obtained on rumen fluid containing medium. faecal and slurry samples were also plated onto the appropriate medium containing the antibiotics tetracycline, erythromycin and tylosin (10 micro g ml-1, individually) and the proportional counts of organisms  capable of growing in the presence of these antibiotics determined. randomly selected isolates from the highest dilutions were identified by 16 s rdna sequence analysis, and selected physiological characteristics were determined. the results of these examinations indicate that the predominant culturable microorganisms from these environments are obligately anaerobic, low mol percentage g + c gram positive bacteria (firmicutes) who are members of clostridial, eubacterial, and lactobacillus/streptococcus phylogenetic groups. isolates similar to sporomusa and flexibacter/cytophaga/bacteroides (cfb or bacteroidetes) groups were also obtained. although similar overall, faecal and slurry samples differed in bacterial composition. manure slurry samples were dominated by organisms similar to clostridium coccoides and enterococcus species  whereas the distribution of species present in faeces appeared much broader. whereas most of the pure cultures could be assigned to known phylogenetic groupings, few could be identified as known species. examination of some growth and physiological characteristics of faecal and slurry isolates showed these to be primarily carbohydrate fermenters, although some were able to ferment lactate  and amino acids. when the ability of manure and faecal isolates to ferment protein, peptides and amino acids was examined, a relatively small percentage of  these were able to do so and most of these fermented carbohydrates in addition to the amino acid sources provided. the predominant amino acid fermenters were most  closely related to c. coccoides and c. botulinum, but representatives of the bacteroides, staphylococcus, enterococcus and other phylogenetic groups were also found. the results reported here are compared with those obtained from clone libraries prepared from the same environmental samples.

AB  == aims: to mathematically model published thermal inactivation data sets using an empirical model based on a double arrhenius function. methods and results: a mathematical model, the log r-fat, provided an excellent description of the data  sets available: the thermal inactivation of salmonella anatum at 55 degrees c, pseudomonas viscosa at 48 degrees c and streptococcus faecalis at 60 degrees c; clostridium botulinum spores at various temperatures in the range of 101-121 degrees c (two data sets); thermal inactivation of salmonella bedford over the temperature range 50-58 degrees c, water activity range of 0.94-0.99 and a ph range of 4-7; bacillus stearothermophilus spores from 105 to 121 degrees c and the dry heat sterilization of an indigenous mesophilic soil population over the temperature range of 120-160 degrees c. conclusions: the log r-fat model, derived from previously published chemical inactivation studies provides as good, if not  better, description of thermal inactivation kinetics as other published models. the model does not invoke either of the two hypotheses of inactivation: the mechanistic or vitalistic, although it is closely linked to descriptions of the former. significance and impact of the study: the log r-fat double arrhenius function provides the investigator with a relatively simple and easy mathematical model to apply to data of thermal inactivation. this model may allow a more accurate description of thermal food processing, especially when the safety of marginal heat processes are concerned.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of foodborne paenibacillus and bacillus spp. against clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the saprophytic paenibacillus and bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. culture supernatants of 200 strains of paenibacillus and bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against c.  botulinum type a, proteolytic type b, and type e strains in a well diffusion assay. nineteen strains were positive against c. botulinum. among those, seven paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the  largest antimicrobial spectrum against c. botulinum strains. the antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive p. polymyxa strains. the antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees c and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees c in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. in co-cultures with the positive strain of p. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a c. botulinum type e strain was inhibited whenever p. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before c. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. the antimicrobial activity of p. polymyxa against c. botulinum was attributed to the  production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to  these antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of clostridium botulinum  strain nctc 2916.
AB  == an 8 kb segment of the clostridium botulinum nctc 2916 genome 5' to the type a botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames.  four encode components (ha70, ha17, ha34 and ntnh/a) of the progenitor toxin complex. the product of the fifth, orfx, possesses a putative c-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including msmr from streptococcus mutans, uvia from c. perfringens and orftxe1 located upstream of the c. difficile toxin b gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types b, c, d and g botulinum toxins. primer extension and northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [ha34, ha17, ha70] and [ntnh/a, type a toxin gene], with the orfx gene expressed singly. immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the ha34 and ntnh/a genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-attttaggtttacaaaa-3' and 5'-atgttatatgtaa-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type c botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. it is likely that these sequence motifs, together with orfx, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups i, iii and iv c. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.

TI  == effect of antibiotics on production of enzymes and toxins by microorganisms.
AB  == the synthesis of microbial products is mediated by either chromosomes, plasmids,  or bacteriophages. the role of some of these products in the pathogenicity of the producing organisms is clearly understood, while the identity and role of others  are still under investigation. this article reviews the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on the synthesis of various microbial products (virulence factors) by producing organisms. synthesis in many cases is enhanced,  whereas in others it is either decreased or unaffected. highly selective inhibition of the production of some enzymes and toxins by certain antibiotics may be explained by the fact that the ribosomes synthesizing these proteins are peripherally localized and may be more sensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of antibiotics than are cytoplasmic ribosomes, although conclusive evidence for the synthesis of bacterial enzymes and toxins on membrane-bound ribosomes is lacking.

AB  == actively growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were screened by a plate assay, with reconstituted guinea pig collagen as a substrate, for their ability to produce a collagenolytic factor. collagenolytic activity was not demonstrated among the aerobic organisms tested, with the exception of one strain of staphylococcus aureus (only when grown under anaerobic conditions). collagenolytic activity, however, was detected in cultures of clostridium tetani  and bacteroides species other than b. melaninogenicus. collagenolytic activity of these organisms could be confirmed by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline liberated from the collagen gel during growth. although collagenase production by pseudomonas aeruginosa has been suggested in previous reports, our results were negative. an extracellular fraction of p. aeruginosa was able to hydrolyze a synthetic hexapeptide cbz-glycyl-l-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l- alanine, but  was without detectable effect on reconstituted collagen.
