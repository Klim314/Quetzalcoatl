TI  - Growth and fermentation of D-xylose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a novel D-xylose isomerase originating from the bacterium Prevotella ruminicola TC2-24.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing D-xylose isomerase (XI) produce some of the highest reported ethanol yields from D-xylose. Unfortunately, most bacterial XIs that have been expressed in S. cerevisiae are either not functional, require additional strain modification, or have low affinity for D-xylose. This study analyzed several XIs from rumen and intestinal microorganisms to identify enzymes with improved properties for engineering S. cerevisiae for D-xylose fermentation. RESULTS: Four XIs originating from rumen and intestinal bacteria were isolated and expressed in a S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1C parental strain primed for D-xylose metabolism by over expression of its native D-xylulokinase. Three of the XIs were functional in S. cerevisiae, based on the strain's ability to grow in D-xylose medium. The most promising strain, expressing the XI mined from Prevotella ruminicola TC2-24, was further adapted for aerobic and fermentative growth by serial transfers of D-xylose cultures under aerobic, and followed by microaerobic conditions. The evolved strain had a specific growth rate of 0.23 h-1 on D-xylose medium, which is comparable to the best reported results for analogous S. cerevisiae strains including those expressing the Piromyces sp. E2 XI. When used to ferment D-xylose, the adapted strain produced 13.6 g/L ethanol in 91 h with a metabolic yield of 83% of theoretical. From analysis of the P. ruminicola XI, it was determined the enzyme possessed a Vmax of 0.81 mumole/min/mg protein and a Km of 34 mM. CONCLUSION: This study identifies a new xylose isomerase from the rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola TC2-24 that has one of the highest affinities and specific activities compared to other bacterial and fungal D-xylose isomerases expressed in yeast. When expressed in S. cerevisiae and used to ferment D-xylose, very high ethanol yield was obtained. This new XI should be a promising resource for constructing other D-xylose fermenting strains, including industrial yeast genetic backgrounds.
TI  - Effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased (P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (Lama pacos) and sheep (Ovis aries).
AB  - Two bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. After the amplification using the universal 16S rRNA gene primers, equal quantities of PCR products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. Sequence analysis showed that the 60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with Eubacterium sp. F1. The 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with Prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). Clones closely related to Clostridium proteoclasticum, Eubacterium sp. F1, Clostridium cellobioparum, Mogibacterium neglectum, Eubacterium ventriosum, Clostridiaceae bacterium WN011, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium orbiscindens, Eubacterium sp. F1, Cytophaga sp. Dex80-37, Treponema bryantii and Pelotomaculum sp. FP were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to Anaerovorax odorimutans, Treponema zioleckii, Bifidobacterium indicum, Paludibacter propionicigenes, Paraprevotella clara, Eubacterium siraeum, Desulfotomaculum sp. CYP1, Clostridium bolteae, Clostridium termitidis and Clostridiaceae bacterium DJF_LS40 only in the rumen of sheep. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies (6.89 [Log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71, P<0.01). The two clone libraries also appeared different in Shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). Our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Description of development of rumen ecosystem by PCR assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  - This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.
TI  - Diversity of extracellular proteolytic activities among Prevotella species from the rumen.
AB  - The current research was aimed at comparing proteolytic activities among ruminal  Prevotella spp. Growth rates of Prevotella sp. 2202, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, P. brevis GA33, P. albensis M384, and P. bryantii B(1)4 varied with N source, and no one N source produced the fastest growth in all species. Proteolytic activity was greatest with casein compared with peptides, AA, and NH(4)Cl in all species. Proteolytic activity of Prevotella sp. 2202, P. brevis GA33, and P. bryantii B(1)4 was modulated by N source. With gelatin co-polymerized SDS-PAGE, the extracellular activities of the Prevotella spp. showed wide variation in number, size, and type of proteases. Prevotella sp. 2202 and P. albensis M384 produced metalloproteases of low molecular weight (40 kDa). P. ruminicola D31d produced one cysteine protease (100-200 kDa) and two metalloproteases (90-100 kDa). P. brevis GA33 generated a diffuse clearing zone (95-160 kDa) containing serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases. P. bryantii B(1)4 produced a metalloprotease greater than 200 kDa in size. The molecular sizes provided are estimations and served only to differentiate among the bacterial species in this study. Large variations in proteolytic activities among species and the known genetic diversity of the Prevotella taxon suggested that targeting this bacterial assemblage for genetic manipulation in order to alter the bacterial impact on ruminal protein degradation would be difficult.
TI  - Glutamate dehydrogenase activity profiles for type strains of ruminal Prevotella  spp.
AB  - The glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities for the type strains of Prevotella ruminicola (strain 23), Prevotella brevis (strain GA33), and Prevotella bryantii (strain B(1)4) were assessed by a combination of enzyme assays and analysis of migration patterns of GDH proteins following nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unlike results with most other prokaryotes, but similar to results with other members of the family Bacteroidaceae, NADPH-utilizing specific activity was greatest in all species following ammonia-limited growth. Similar also to previous findings with P. bryantii, the NAD(P)H-utilizing GDH activity of P. ruminicola can be attributed to a single protein. However, P. brevis produces an additional GDH protein(s) in response to growth with peptides. These results conclusively demonstrate that all type strains of the ruminal Prevotella sp. grouping possess GDH activity.
TI  - Phenotypic diversity among ruminal isolates of Prevotella ruminicola: proposal of Prevotella brevis sp. nov., Prevotella bryantii sp. nov., and Prevotella albensis sp. nov. and redefinition of Prevotella ruminicola.
AB  - Selected phenotypic characteristics of isolates of Prevotella ruminicola (formerly Bacteroides ruminicola) were studied in order to establish whether the characteristics of genotypic strain groups established previously on the basis of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences differed systematically. Among strains formerly considered P. ruminicola subsp. brevis, strains related to strain GA33T (T = type strain) typically failed to produce carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity detectable by plate assays and failed to ferment xylose, while strains related to strain B14T produced abundant CMCase and fermented xylose. We propose that strains related to GA33T, which have DNA G + C contents between 45 and 51 mol%, should be assigned to a new species, Prevotella brevis, and that strains related to B14T, which have DNA G + C contents between 39 and 43 mol%, should be assigned to another new species, Prevotella bryantii. Most of the isolates formerly classified as P. ruminicola subsp. ruminicola strains produced CMCase and had DNA G + C contents between 45 and 51 mol%, and we propose that these organisms should be placed in the redefined species P. ruminicola. A small group of isolates that have lower G + C contents are assigned to another new species, Prevotella albensis. Most P. brevis and P. bryantii strains produced abundatn extracellular DNase activity. Proteinase activities (as determined by [14C]casein hydrolysis) varied widely between strains, and P. brevis strains exhibited the highest mean activity. All strains produced dipeptidyl peptidase activity, but the relative activities against different peptide substrates exhibited by P. bryantii, P. albensis, and P. brevis differed systematically. The phenotypic differences among the newly defined species suggest that they may occupy distinct niches within the rumen ecosystem.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
