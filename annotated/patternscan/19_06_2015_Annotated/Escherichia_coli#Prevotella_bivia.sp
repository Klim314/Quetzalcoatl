TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing hiv-1-specific acquired immunity.  nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to hiv-1 infection under natural conditions. if similar conditions can  be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against hiv-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-hiv-1 vaccines. we reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to hiv-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various toll-like receptor (tlr) ligands and commensal bacteria on hiv-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of hiv-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. we established the hiv-1 reporter monocytic cell line, thp-1/nl4-3luc,  which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. in these cells, stimulation of tlr3 and tlr4 by their ligands suppressed hiv-1 expression  partly through type i interferon (ifn). among the commensal bacteria tested, escherichia coli, veillonella parvula and neisseria mucosa suppressed hiv-1 expression, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella melaninogenica, p. bivia and mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. the bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated tlr4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated tlr2. neutralizing antibodies against tlr4 and ifn-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated hiv-1 suppression. suppressive effects of e. coli, v. parvula and n. mucosa on hiv-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute hiv-1 infection. these findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating tlr4 potentially produce local environments resistant to hiv-1 infection.

TI  == prevotella bivia as a source of lipopolysaccharide in the vagina.
AB  == objectives: to compare vaginal lipopolysaccharides (lps) concentrations between patients with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), to evaluate the correlation between prevotella bivia colonization density and lps concentration, and to determine the impact of lps on loss of dopamine neurons (da). methods: vaginal washes obtained from patients with (n=43) and without (n=59) bv were tested for quantity of p. bivia cells using quantitative pcr and for concentrations of lps using the limulus amebocyte lysate gel clot method. prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and escherichia coli sonicated cell extracts were also tested for lps production. da neuron cells obtained from embryonic day (e) 14.5 pregnant rats were exposed to fluid from eight vaginal washes; tyrosine hydrolase immunoreactive staining was applied for visualization and cell counts. results: the median lps concentrations were dramatically higher among patients who had symptoms of bv compared to those who did not have symptoms (3235.0 vs 46.4 eu/ml, respectively, p<0.001); patients who had bv also had much higher colonization densities of p. bivia (0.06+/-0.36 vs 5.4+/-2.2 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively, p<0.001). prevotella bivia cell lysates resulted in a higher lps concentration (10,713.0+/-306.6 eu/ml) than either e. coli (4679.0+/-585.3 eu/ml) or g. vaginalis (0.07+/-0.01 eu/ml of lps). the loss of da neuron was 20-27% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from bv-negative patients and 58-97% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from patients with bv. conclusion: p. bivia  produces high lps concentration, which may create a toxic vaginal environment that damages da neurons.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == we studied the serum bactericidal activity (sba) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against common pathogens associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections.  ten healthy volunteers received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (750 mg) and serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h after the dose of each drug. bactericidal titers in serum over time were determined for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebseilla pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae) and anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella bivia, and finegoldia magna).  both fluoroquinolones provided rapid (2h) attainment and prolonged (24h) sba (titers > or = 1:8) against each of the aerobic bacilli studied. sba was observed for at least 12h against b. fragilis strains with mics < or = 2 microg/ml to moxifloxacin and < or = 4 microg/ml to levofloxacin. prolonged (12h) sba (titers  > or = 1:2) was also observed against isolates of b. thetaiotaomicron, p. bivia,  and f. magna with moxifloxacin < or = mics 2 microg/ml.

TI  == [clinical investigation on administration method of gatifloxacin based on pk/pd theory].
AB  == there have not been sufficient clinical studies based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, on which many clinical doctors  have recently focused. to consider the optimized administration method based on pk/pd theory for gatifloxacin (gflx), which was one of the oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial, we influenzae investigated clinical efficacies and adverse events  for pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) in giving gflx daily 400 mg divided twice a day or four times a day. the number of leukocyte and the value of crp were significantly reduced by chemotherapy in twice a day group, compared with four times a day group. we were able to measure the blood level in 4 cases. the auc/mic values for presumption causative bacteria (causative bacteria in both cases: escherichia coli) in cured patients were 142.28 and 280.16, however, in therapy-failed patients, the auc/mic value to presumption causative bacterium were 4.10 (causative bacteria: prevotella bivia) and 4.35 (causative bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa). these results suggested the importance of the therapeutic method based on pk/pd theory.

TI  == universal dna primers amplify bacterial dna from human fetal membranes and link fusobacterium nucleatum with prolonged preterm membrane rupture.
AB  == a large number of bacterial species have been identified in fetal membranes after preterm labour (ptl) associated with intrauterine infection by microbiological culture. in this study, we have investigated a molecular and bioinformatic approach to organism identification which surmounts the need for specific and diverse microbiological culture conditions required by conventional methods. samples of fetal membranes were taken from 37 preterm infants, and 6 normal term  controls delivered by caesarean section, in which bacteria had been detected by in situ hybridization of 16s ribosomal rna using a generic probe. degenerate primers were designed to amplify bacterial 16s ribosomal dna by pcr and used to amplify bacterial dna from human fetal membranes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced and bacteria were identified bioinformatically by comparison of sequences with known bacterial dna genomes. in situ hybridization using an organism specific probe was then used to confirm the presence of the commonest identified organism in tissue samples. bacterial dna amplified from 15/43 samples, all from preterm deliveries, and the bioinformatic approach identified organisms in all cases. multiple bacteria were identified including mycoplasma hominis, pasturella multocida, pseudomonas ph1, escherichia coli and prevotella bivia. the commonest organism fusobacterium nucleatum was found in 9/15 (60%) of  samples. ten of the 12 samples obtained after prolonged membrane rupture were positive for bacterial dna, and 7 of these (70%) contained dna from f. nucleatum. bacteria from fetal membranes may be identified by molecular and bioinformatic methods. further work is warranted to investigate the apparent linkage between f. nucleatum, fetal membrane rupture and preterm delivery.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == an experimental mouse model to study the pathogenicity of prevotella bivia and investigations of possible virulence.
AB  == induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice was used to study the pathogenicity of prevotella bivia both in mono-infection and in mixed cultures with escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus spp. virulence factors such as coaggregation and aggregate formation of cells, haemagglutination activity and tolerance to serum bactericidal activity were investigated for their possible role in p bivia pathogenicity. monocultures of p bivia, e coli and peptostreptococcus spp did not induce subcutaneous abscess at concentrations as high as 10(9) colony forming units/millilitre (cfu/ml). only e coli persisted at the infection site for up to  7 days post infection but with a marked decline in cell count (8.0 x 10(2) cfu/ml). the anaerobic organisms did not persist at the infection sites beyond the fifth day. in contrast, mixed cultures of p bivia and e coli or all three organisms potentiated for infective abscess two weeks after infection. viable cells were recovered from abscesses in greater numbers as the infection progressed. prevotella bivia was the predominant organism in chronic abscesses while e coli predominated in abscesses in the acute stage of the infection. prevotella bivia lacked haemagglutination activity against human and sheep erythrocytes and showed marked susceptibility to 50 per cent human serum. these may limit its haematogenous spread. its ability to form aggregates in molar salt  solutions and coaggregate with facultative organisms may account for its persistence in pathological sites.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

AB  == e1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. e1101 was the most active agent against s. agalactiae and e. coli.  since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. the results of this study  suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, e1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == studies on the pathogenicity of anaerobes, especially prevotella bivia, in a rat  pyometra model.
AB  == objective: prevotella bivia is one of the anaerobic bacteria that resides in the  flora of the female genital tract. we studied the pathogenicity of p. bivia in a  rat pyometra model. methods: the experimental animal (rat) model of pyometra was  developed to investigate the pathogenicity of p. bivia in a rat pyometra model. results: in the groups inoculated with aerobes alone, the infection rate was 10%  (1/10) in the staphylococcus aureus- or staphylococcus agalactiae-inoculated group and 20% (2/10) in the escherichia coli-inoculated group. infection was not  established in the groups inoculated with anaerobes alone. high infection rates were observed in all the mixed-infection groups. in the s. agalactiae- and bacteroides fragilis-, s. agalactiae- and p. bivia-, f. coli- and b. fragilis-, and e. coli- and p. bivia-inoculated groups, an infection rate of 100% (10/10) was demonstrated. the efficacy of antibiotics such as flomoxef (fmox) could be determined using a rat pyometra model. in relation to the alteration of vaginal microbial flora during the menstrual cycle, estrogen increased the growth of p. bivia. conclusion: mixture of aerobic bacteria and p. bivia increased the pathogenicity of p. bivia. estrogen would be useful for raising up the inflammatory change of the uterus in experimental models of genital tract infection due to p. bivia.

TI  == effects of prophylactic antibiotics on endometrial flora in women with postcesarean endometritis.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of prophylactic antibiotics on endometrial and endocervical microflora upon diagnosis of postcesarean endometritis. methods: the medical records of patients enrolled in open-label comparative trials of therapeutic antibiotics for postpartum endometritis between 1989 and 1994 were reviewed (n = 682). endometritis was diagnosed by a standard definition that included fever and localizing signs. endometrial cultures were obtained by a sheathed injection/aspiration technique. aerobes and anaerobes were isolated by standard microbiologic techniques. the primary outcome, endometrial and endocervical microflora, was compared in women who received intravenous ampicillin (2 g every 6 hours for 1-3 doses), cephalosporin (2 g every 6 hours for 1-3 doses), or no prophylaxis. secondary outcomes included the cure of endometritis and the prevalence of wound infection in the three groups. results:  four hundred sixty-five of 682 patients (67%) had a cesarean delivery. one hundred fifty-one patients received ampicillin prophylaxis, 100 patients received cefazolin prophylaxis, 18 patients received extended-spectrum antibiotics, and 196 patients received no prophylaxis. patients who received cefazolin prophylaxis had a significant increase in enterococcus (p < .05) and a significant decrease in proteus species (p < .05) from endometrial samples. patients who received ampicillin prophylaxis had a significant increase of mycoplasma species (p < .05), klebsiella pneumoniae (p < .0001), escherichia coli (p = .04), and any aerobic gram-negative rod (p = .003) from endometrial samples. ampicillin prophylaxis was associated with a decrease in prevotella bivia (p < .05) and any  anaerobe (p < .01). endometritis cure rates were similar between prophylaxis groups and between prophylaxis and treatment groups. however, the cefazolin prophylaxis followed by cephalosporin treatment was associated with more wound infections (19%) than other prophylaxis and treatment groups, (6%, p < .01). conclusion: ampicillin and cefazolin prophylaxis alters endometrial and endocervical microflora of women who develop endometritis. whereas these changes  had no effect on endometritis cure rate (power > 80%), the association between cefazolin prophylaxis followed by an extended-spectrum cephalosporin and wound infection may warrant caution against the use of the combination.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == am-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the  antibacterial activity of am-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. the in vivo efficacy of am-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (e. coli and b. fragilis) model of rats. the accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in  the am-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent am-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new carbapenem bo-2727 for use in obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of bo-2727 against 100 clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae (20 strains), escherichia coli (20 strains), peptostreptococcus magnus (20 strains), bacteroides fragilis (20 strains) and prevotella bivia (20 strains) was compared with those of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, biapenem and ceftazidime (caz). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 50% of tested strains (mic50s) of bo-2727 against s. agalactiae, e. coli, p. magnus, b. fragilis and p. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. mic90s of bo-2727 against s. agalactiae, e. coli, p. magnus,  b. fragilis and p. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively.  the efficacy of bo-2727 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra model (e. coli and b. fragilis) in rats. both the inflammatory changes in the uterus, from  the point of view of neutrophil accumulation, and the bacteriological response in the treated group were milder than those in either the nontreated group or the caz-treated group. these results indicate that bo-2727 may be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in patients with pyometra.

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == a study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  == twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (two cases stage o; four cases  stage ia; five cases stage ib; one case stage iia; ten cases stage iib; two cases stage iiia; one case stage iva) served as the subjects. the bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. there was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. the average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. the predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis, and prevotella bivia. as the stages of cervical cancer progressed, g.  vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. these findings suggest that there is a relationship between g. vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.
