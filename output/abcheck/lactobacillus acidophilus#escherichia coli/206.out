probiotic properties of human lactobacilli strains to be used in the gastrointestinal tract.
aims: the study of two human strains of lactobacillus to be used as probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
methods and results: the lactobacillus acidophilus uo 001 and lact.
gasseri uo 002, were resistant to the gastrointestinal conditions (ph 2 and 3, presence of pepsin, pancreatin or bile salts), the resistance was enhanced in the presence of skimmed milk.
additionally, adhered to caco-2 cells through glycoproteins in lact.
gasseri and carbohydrates in the case of lact. acidophilus.
these strains are able to inhibit the growth of certain enteropathogens: salmonella, listeria and campylobacter without interfering with the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, as stated by using the mixed culture and the spot agar test.
finally, strongly adherent lact.
gasseri were found to inhibit the attachment of escherichia coli o111 to intestinal caco-2 cells under the condition of exclusion.
conclusions: these results indicate that the two strains of lactobacillus from human origin present important properties for survival in, and colonization of, the gastrointestinal tract, that give them potential probiotic.
significance and impact of the study: two strains of lactobacillus isolated from human vagina of healthy premenopausal women could be promising candidates to be used in the preparation of probiotic products and for their use as health-promoting bacteria.
