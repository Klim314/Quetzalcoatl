TI  == effect of various rinsing protocols after use of amine fluoride/stannous fluoride toothpaste on the bacterial composition of dental plaque.
AB  == this clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. after a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized  crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. the 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of amf/snf(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants  either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an amf/snf(2) mouthwash. in the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. the microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard dna:dna hybridization. a statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of dna of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in  the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having  used the amf/snf(2) toothpaste + amf/snf(2) mouthrinsing. the results indicate that using the amf/snf(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.
