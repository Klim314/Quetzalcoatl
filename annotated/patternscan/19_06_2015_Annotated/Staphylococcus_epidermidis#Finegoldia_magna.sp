TI  == the culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  == the complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and staphylococcus aureus carriage. considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16s rrna gene community profiling. cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with finegoldia magna. staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as s. aureus' principle habitat. culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only  a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. while the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach.  to determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification  by culturomic analyses.

TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.
