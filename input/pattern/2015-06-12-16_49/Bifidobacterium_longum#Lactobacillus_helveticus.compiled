TI  - Vagotomy prevents the effect of probiotics on caspase activity in a model of postmyocardial infarction depression.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with apoptosis in the amygdala and, ultimately, with clinical signs of depression. Different treatments have proven to be beneficial in preventing depression, including combination of the probiotics Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum for prophylaxis. We have speculated previously that the benefit of these probiotics is due to their anti-inflammatory properties, and evidence suggests that an intact vagus nerve is important for this effect to occur. This study was designed to ascertain vagus nerve involvement in the beneficial influence of probiotics on caspase activities in our post-MI animal model of depression. METHODS: Probiotics and/or vehicle were administered daily to male adult rats, 14 days before MI and until euthanasia. Vagotomy was performed in subgroups of rats 40 min before MI. They were sacrificed after 3 days of reperfusion, and MI size was assessed along with caspase-3 and -8 activities in the amygdala. KEY RESULTS: Probiotics had no effect on infarct size but vagotomy increased it. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in the amygdala were higher in MI than in sham-operated rats, and this outcome was reversed by probiotics. The beneficial influence of probiotics was abolished by vagotomy. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Our data indicate that the effect of probiotics on caspase activities in the amygdala after MI depends on an intact vagus nerve.
TI  - Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071 results in a greater proportion of healthy days and a lower percentage of academically stressed students reporting a day of cold/flu: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - Acute psychological stress is positively associated with a cold/flu. The present  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of three potentially probiotic bacteria on the proportion of healthy days over a 6-week period in academically stressed undergraduate students (n 581) who received Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis R0033, Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071 or placebo. On each day, participants recorded the intensity (scale: 0 = not experiencing to 3 = very intense) for nine cold/flu symptoms, and a sum of symptom intensity >6 was designated as a day of cold/flu. B. bifidum resulted in a greater proportion of healthy days than placebo (P</= 0.05). The percentage of participants reporting >/= 1 d of cold/flu during the 6-week intervention period was significantly lower with B. bifidum than with placebo (P< 0.05). There were no effects of B. infantis or L. helveticus compared with placebo on either outcome. A predictive model accounted for influential characteristics and their interactions on daily reporting of cold/flu episodes. The proportion of participants reporting a cold on any given day was lower at weeks 2 and 3 with B. bifidum and B. infantis than with placebo for the average level of stress and the most commonly reported number of hours of sleep. Daily intake of bifidobacteria provides benefit related to cold/flu outcomes during acute stress.
TI  - The effect of a multi-strain probiotic on the resistance toward Escherichia coli  challenge in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease. It is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components, by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system. OBJECTIVE: A parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males, to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus Rosell-52, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell-11, Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum Rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii CNCM I-1079) on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge. Primary outcomes studied were fecal ETEC excretion and total fecal output per day. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Subjects were randomized to the probiotic (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units (CFUs); twice daily; n=30) or placebo group (twice daily; n=30). After 2 weeks, subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated ETEC (3 x 10(9) CFU), previously demonstrated to induce mild, short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection. Before and after ETEC challenge, subjects collected 24 h fecal samples. Compliance to study guidelines, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Score), stool frequency, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (GI) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a Daily Record Questionnaire. RESULTS: ETEC challenge induced a significant increase in fecal ETEC excretion in both groups. However, a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group. ETEC challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight, and an increase in reported Bristol Stool Score, stool frequency and GI complaints. Dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight. In addition, ETEC increased C-reactive protein, total secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G Colonization Factor Antigen II. CONCLUSION: Dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated ETEC challenge in human subjects.
TI  - Multistrain probiotic modulation of intestinal epithelial cells' immune response  to a double-stranded RNA ligand, poly(i.c).
AB  - A commercially available product containing three probiotic bacterial strains (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis R0033, and Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071) was previously shown in animal trials to modulate both TH1 and TH2 immune responses. Clinical studies on this combination of bacteria have also shown positive health effects against seasonal winter diseases and rotavirus infection. The goal of this study was to use a well-established in vitro intestinal epithelial (HT-29) cell model that has been shown to constitutively express double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors (Toll-like receptor 3 [TLR3], retinoic acid-inducible gene I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and dsRNA-activated protein kinase). By using the HT-29 cell model, we wanted to evaluate whether or not this combination of three bacteria had the capacity to immune modulate the host cell response to a dsRNA ligand, poly(I.C). Using a custom-designed, two-color expression microarray targeting genes of the human immune system, we investigated the response of HT-29 cells challenged with poly(I.C) both in the presence and in the absence of the three probiotic bacteria. We observed that the combination of the three bacteria had a major impact on attenuating the expression of genes connected to proinflammatory TH1 and antiviral innate immune responses compared to that obtained by the poly(I.C)-only challenge. Major pathways through which the multistrain combination may be eliciting its immune-modulatory effect include the TLR3 domain-containing adapter-inducing beta interferon (TRIF), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Such a model may be useful for selecting potential biomarkers for the design of future clinical trials.
TI  - Probiotic gut effect prevents the chronic psychological stress-induced brain activity abnormality in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A probiotic formulation (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 combination, Probio'Stick((R)) ) displays anxiolytic-like activity and reduces apoptosis in the lymbic system in animal models of depression. Based on the hypothesis that modulation of gut microbiota by this probiotic formulation has beneficial effects on brain activity in stress conditions, we report a set of probiotic-evoked physiological, cellular, and molecular events in the brain of Probio'Stick((R)) pretreated mice submitted to chronic psychological stress. METHODS: Water avoidance stress (WAS) was applied or not (sham). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to the chronic stress were assessed through plasma corticosterone and catecholamine measurements. Specific markers for neuronal activity, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity were used to assess brain activity. In addition, gut permeability and tight junction (TJ) proteins levels were also determinated. KEY RESULTS: We observed that a pretreatment with the probiotic formulation attenuated HPA axis and ANS activities in response to WAS, and reduced cFos expression in different brain areas but Lactobacillus salivarius (a negative control) treatment was ineffective on these parameters. Moreover, probiotic pretreatment prevented the WAS-induced decrease hippocampal neurogenesis and expression changes in hypothalamic genes involved in synaptic plasticity. These central effects were associated with restoration of TJ barrier integrity in stressed mice. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: These data suggest that chronic stress-induced abnormal brain plasticity and reduction in neurogenesis can be prevented by a pretreatment with the Probio'Stick((R)) formulation, suggesting that probiotics modulate neuroregulatory factors and various signaling pathways in the central nervous system involved in stress response.
TI  - The diversity of intestinal microbiota of Mongolians living in Inner Mongolia, China.
AB  - The Mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. However, by now, little research has been focused on Mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. In this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy Mongolians recruited from Hohhot city and the Xilin Gol pasturing area in Inner Mongolia. Compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of Mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. Especially, the numbers of Phascolarctobacterium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are rather high. DGGE profiles of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium revealed that Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the Mongolian subjects studied. On the contrary, Lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area Mongolian, but not in any of the Hohhot city Mongolians. qPCR results revealed that the numbers of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium of Xilin Gol Mongolians were significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of Hohhot Mongolians, whereas the numbers of Enterobacterium were significantly lower (P<0.05). In addition, by partial least squares discriminate analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from DGGE and qPCR experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of Mongolians living in Hohhot city and the Xilin Gol pasturing area has been found. This study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of Mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.
TI  - A probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and Lactobacillus helveticus Bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two elderly volunteers living in Italy. The group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. MEASUREMENTS: For each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform HTF-Microbi.Array before and after intervention. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. In particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens Clostridium cluster XI, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecium and the enteropathogenic genus Campylobacter. CONCLUSION: The present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Attenuation of post-myocardial infarction depression in rats by n-3 fatty acids or probiotics starting after the onset of reperfusion.
AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in depression-like behaviour and apoptosis in the limbic system after myocardial infarction (MI). A PUFA n-3 diet or the combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 probiotics, when given before the ischaemic period, reduce circulating proinflammatory cytokines as well as apoptosis in the limbic system. The present study was designed to determine if the same nutritional interventions maintain their beneficial effects when started after the onset of the reperfusion period and attenuate depression-like behaviour observed after MI. MI was induced by the occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 40 min in rats. After the onset of reperfusion, animals were fed with a high- or low-PUFA n-3 diet, combined or not with one billion live bacteria of L. helveticus and B. longum. At 3 d post-MI, caspase-3 enzymatic activities and terminal 2'-deoxyuridine, 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells were decreased in the CA1, dentate gyrus (DG) and amygdala with the high-PUFA n-3 diet, as compared to the three other diets. Probiotics attenuated caspase-3 activity and TUNEL-positive cells in the DG and the medial amygdala. At 2 weeks post-MI, depression-like behaviour was observed in the low-PUFA n-3 diet without probiotics-group, and this behaviour was attenuated with the high-PUFA n-3 diet or/and probiotics. These results indicate that a high-PUFA n-3 diet or the administration of probiotics, starting after the onset of reperfusion, are beneficial to attenuate apoptosis in the limbic system and post-MI depression in the rat.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the effect of probiotics and prebiotics on the metabolic profile of human microbiota.
AB  - In the current study, batch culture fermentations on fecal samples of 3 healthy individuals were performed to assess the effect of the addition of prebiotics (FOS), probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and Lactobacillus helveticus Bar13) and synbiotics (B. longum Bar33 + L. helveticus Bar13 + FOS) on the fecal metabolic profiles. A total of 84 different metabolites belonging to the families of sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols, phenols, organic acids, and hydrocarbons were detected by GC-MS/SPME analysis. The highest number of metabolites varied in concentration in the models with added FOS and synbiotics, where several metabolic signatures were found in common. The increase of butyrate represented the greatest variation registered after the addition of FOS alone. Following the B. longum Bar33 addition, 2-methyl butyrate underwent the most evident variation. In the batch fermentation with added L. helveticus Bar13, the decrease of pyridine and butandiene was observed together with the increase of 2-methyl-5-ethyl-pyrazine, 2-butanone and butyrate. The modification of the fecal metabolic profiles induced by the simultaneous addition of B. longum Bar33 and L. helveticus Bar13 was very similar to that observed after the supplementation with L. helveticus Bar13, regarding mainly the decrease of pyridine and the increase of butyrate.
TI  - The impact of meals on a probiotic during transit through a model of the human upper gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Commercial literature on various probiotic products suggests that they can be taken before meals, during meals or after meals or even without meals. This has led to serious confusion for the industry and the consumer. The objective of our study was to examine the impact of the time of administration with respect to mealtime and the impact of the buffering capacity of the food on the survival of probiotic microbes during gastrointestinal transit. We used an in vitro Digestive System (IViDiS) model of the upper gastrointestinal tract to examine the survival of a commercial multi-strain probiotic, ProtecFlor(R). This product, in a capsule form, contains four different microbes: two lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011), Bifidobacterium longum R0175 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii. Enumeration during and after transit of the stomach and duodenal models showed that survival of all the bacteria in the product was best when given with a meal or 30 minutes before a meal (cooked oatmeal with milk). Probiotics given 30 minutes after the meal did not survive in high numbers. Survival in milk with 1% milk fat and oatmeal-milk gruel were significantly better than apple juice or spring water. S. boulardii was not affected by time of meal or the buffering capacity of the meal. The protein content of the meal was probably not as important for the survival of the bacteria as the fat content. We conclude that ideally, non-enteric coated bacterial probiotic products should be taken with or just prior to a meal containing some fats.
TI  - Beneficial psychological effects of a probiotic formulation (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175) in healthy human volunteers.
AB  
TI  - Combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 reduces post-myocardial infarction depression symptoms and restores intestinal permeability in a rat model.
AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) in rats is accompanied by apoptosis in the limbic system and a behavioural syndrome similar to models of depression. We have already shown that probiotics can reduce post-MI apoptosis and designed the present study to determine if probiotics can also prevent post-MI depressive behaviour. We also tested the hypothesis that probiotics achieve their central effects through changes in the intestinal barrier. MI was induced in anaesthetised rats via 40-min transient occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery. Sham rats underwent the same surgical procedure without actual coronary occlusion. For 7 d before MI and between the seventh post-MI day and euthanasia, half the MI and sham rats were given one billion live bacterial cells of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 per d dissolved in water, while the remaining animals received only the vehicle (maltodextrin). Depressive behaviour was evaluated 2 weeks post-MI in social interaction, forced swimming and passive avoidance step-down tests. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by oral administration with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, 4 h before euthanasia. MI rats displayed less social interaction and impaired performance in the forced swimming and passive avoidance step-down tests compared to the sham controls (P < 0.05). Probiotics reversed the behavioural effects of MI (P < 0.05), but did not alter the behaviour of sham rats. Intestinal permeability was increased in MI rats and reversed by probiotics. In conclusion, L. helveticus R0052 and B. longum R0175 combination interferes with the development of post-MI depressive behaviour and restores intestinal barrier integrity in MI rats.
TI  - Assessment of psychotropic-like properties of a probiotic formulation (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175) in rats and human subjects.
AB  - In a previous clinical study, a probiotic formulation (PF) consisting of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 (PF) decreased stress-induced gastrointestinal discomfort. Emerging evidence of a role for gut microbiota on central nervous system functions therefore suggests that oral intake of probiotics may have beneficial consequences on mood and psychological distress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anxiolytic-like activity of PF in rats, and its possible effects on anxiety, depression, stress and coping strategies in healthy human volunteers. In the preclinical study, rats were daily administered PF for 2 weeks and subsequently tested in the conditioned defensive burying test, a screening model for anti-anxiety agents. In the clinical trial, volunteers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised parallel group study with PF administered for 30 d and assessed with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-90), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived Stress Scale, the Coping Checklist (CCL) and 24 h urinary free cortisol (UFC). Daily subchronic administration of PF significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviour in rats (P < 0.05) and alleviated psychological distress in volunteers, as measured particularly by the HSCL-90 scale (global severity index, P < 0.05; somatisation, P < 0.05; depression, P < 0.05; and anger-hostility, P < 0.05), the HADS (HADS global score, P < 0.05; and HADS-anxiety, P < 0.06), and by the CCL (problem solving, P < 0.05) and the UFC level (P < 0.05). L. helveticus R0052 and B. longum R0175 taken in combination display anxiolytic-like activity in rats and beneficial psychological effects in healthy human volunteers.
TI  - Immunomodulatory impact of a synbiotic in T(h)1 and T(h)2 models of infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The immunomodulatory activity of a synbiotic combination  containing three bacterial strains (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis R0033 and Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071) and short-chain fructooligosaccharide was examined in two distinct infectious rat models. In the T(h)1 model, Wistar rats were administered the synbiotic combination for 2 weeks prior to challenge with a single oral dose of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or vehicle. In the T(h)2 model, pretreated rats were challenged with a single subcutaneous dose of hook worm, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Blood samples were collected 3 hours or 4 days postchallenge and serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured. RESULTS: Significant reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were observed in both models suggesting a single, unifying mode of action on an upstream regulator. The N. brasiliensis study also compared the effect of the individual strains to synbiotic. For most of cytokines the combination appeared to average the effect of the individual strains with the exception of IL-4 and IL-10 where there was apparent synergy for the combination. Furthermore, the cytokine response varied by strain. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that this synbiotic combination of these three microbes could be beneficial in both T(h)1 and T(h)2 diseases.
TI  - Effect of fermentation by pure and mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus on isoflavone and B-vitamin content of a fermented soy beverage.
AB  - Enhancement of nutritional or vitamin content of foods is commonly touted as a major benefit of probiotics. In this paper, we examined the ability of three probiotic bacteria either alone or in combination to enhance nutritional content. Pure and mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus ST5 and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 or Bifidobacterium longum R0175 were used to prepare fermented soy beverages. The effects of strain, acidification and mixed cultures on the deconjugation of soy isoflavones were examined. Acidification to pH 4.7 alone resulted in a 7% drop in isoflavone levels. Deconjugation levels varied between the different glucosides. Fermentation by L. helveticus R0052 resulted in the 50% reduction in total glucosides with O-malonyl glucosides being reduced 64%. Fermentation by S. thermophilus ST5 or B. longum R0175 had no significant effect on isoflavone levels. Combining a S. thermophilus strain with a L. helveticus culture reduced the effectiveness of the latter. Fermentation did not significantly modify vitamin B1 or B6 levels.
TI  - Bacteria and chocolate: a successful combination for probiotic delivery.
AB  - In this work, chocolate has been evaluated as a potential protective carrier for  oral delivery of a microencapsulated mixture of Lactobacillus helveticus CNCM I-1722 and Bifidobacterium longum CNCM I-3470. A sequential in vitro setup was used to evaluate the protection of the probiotics during passage through the stomach and small intestine, when embedded in dark and milk chocolate or liquid milk. Both chocolates offered superior protection (91% and 80% survival in milk chocolate for L. helveticus and B. longum, respectively compared to 20% and 31% found in milk). To simulate long-term administration, the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) was used. Plate counts, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and quantitative PCR showed that the two probiotics successfully reached the simulated colon compartments. This led to an increase in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counts and the appearance of additional species in the fingerprints. These data indicate that the coating of the probiotics in chocolate is an excellent solution to protect them from environmental stress conditions and for optimal delivery. The simulation with our gastrointestinal model showed that the formulation of a probiotic strain in a specific food matrix could offer superior protection for the delivery of the bacterium into the colon. The chocolate example could act as a trigger for new research to identify new balanced matrices.
TI  - Probiotic colonization of the adherent mucus layer of HT29MTXE12 cells attenuates Campylobacter jejuni virulence properties.
AB  - The HT29MTXE12 (E12) cell line harbors an adherent mucus layer, providing a novel technique to model mucosal infection in vitro. In this study, we have characterized the interaction of Campylobacter jejuni with the E12 cell line and exploited its unique mucus layer to examine the potential efficacy of probiotic treatment to attenuate C. jejuni virulence properties. C. jejuni 81-176 colonized and reproduced in E12 mucus. Adhesion to and internalization of C. jejuni were enhanced in E12 cells harboring mucus compared to parental cells without mucus. Translocation of C. jejuni occurred at early time points following infection. C. jejuni aligned with tight junctions and colocalized with the tight junction protein occludin, suggesting a paracellular route of translocation. Probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011, Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Lactobacillus salivarius AH102, Bifidobacterium longum AH1205, a commercial combination of L. rhamnosus R0011 and L. helveticus R0052 (Lacidofil), and a cocktail consisting of L. rhamnosus, L. helveticus, and L. salivarius (RhHeSa) colonized E12 mucus and bound to underlying cells. Probiotics attenuated C. jejuni association with and internalization into E12 cells and translocation to the basolateral medium of transwells. Live bacteria and prolonged precolonization of E12 cells with probiotics were necessary for probiotic action. These results demonstrate the potential for E12 cells as a model of mucosal pathogenesis and provide a rationale for the further investigation of probiotics as prophylaxis against human campylobacteriosis.
TI  - Impact of a synbiotic food on the gut microbial ecology and metabolic profiles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human gut harbors a diverse community of microorganisms which serve numerous important functions for the host wellbeing. Functional foods are commonly used to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota contributing to the maintenance of the host health or prevention of disease. In the present study, we characterized the impact of one month intake of a synbiotic food, containing fructooligosaccharides and the probiotic strains Lactobacillus helveticus Bar13 and Bifidobacterium longum Bar33, on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles of 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The synbiotic food did not modify the overall structure of the gut microbiome, as indicated by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The ability of the probiotic L. helveticus and B. longum strains to pass through the gastrointestinal tract was hypothesized on the basis of real-time PCR data. In spite of a stable microbiota, the intake of the synbiotic food resulted in a shift of the fecal metabolic profiles, highlighted by the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (GC-MS/SPME) analysis. The extent of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), ketones, carbon disulfide and methyl acetate was significantly affected by the synbiotic food consumption. Furthermore, the Canonical discriminant Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) of GC-MS/SPME profiles allowed a separation of the stool samples recovered before and after the consumption of the functional food. CONCLUSION: In this study we investigated the global impact of a dietary intervention on the gut ecology and metabolism in healthy humans. We demonstrated that the intake of a synbiotic food leads to a modulation of the gut metabolic activities with a maintenance of the gut biostructure. In particular, the significant increase of SCFA, ketones, carbon disulfide and methyl acetate following the feeding period suggests potential health promoting effects of the synbiotic food.
TI  - Immunomodulatory properties of fermented soy and dairy milks prepared with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fermented soy and dairy milk preparations provide a means for delivering lactic acid bacteria and their fermentation products into the diet. Our aims were to test immunomodulatory bioactivity of fermented soy beverage (SB) and dairy milk blend (MB) preparations on human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and to determine the impact of freezing medium on culture survival prior to bioactivity analyses. Fermented SB and MB were prepared using pure or mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus ST5, Bifidobacterium longum R0175, and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052. Immunomodulatory bioactivity was assessed by testing selected SB and MB ferments on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-treated IEC and measuring effects on Interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. Impact of timing of ferment administration relative to this pro-inflammatory challenge was investigated. The most pronounced reductions in IEC IL-8 production were observed when IEC were treated with either SB or MB ferment preparations prior to TNFalpha challenge. These results indicate that freezing-stable MB and SB ferments prepared with selected strains can modulate IEC IL-8 production in vitro, and suggest that yogurt-like fermented soy formulations could provide a functional food alternative to milk-based fermented products.
TI  - Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum taken in combination reduce the apoptosis propensity in the limbic system after myocardial infarction in a rat model.
AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory substances  that induce apoptosis in the limbic system. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are considered as the root cause of apoptosis, although the mechanism is not fully explained and/or understood at this time. In addition, depression may induce gastrointestinal perturbations that maintain the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that some specific probiotic formulations may reduce gastrointestinal problems induced by stress and the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio. Therefore, we hypothesised that probiotics, when given prophylactically, may diminish the apoptosis propensity in the limbic system following a MI. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum in combination) or placebo in their drinking-water for four consecutive weeks. A MI was then induced in the rats by occluding the left anterior coronary artery for 40 min. Rats were killed following a 72 h reperfusion period. Infarct size was not different in the two groups. Bax/Bcl-2 (pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic) ratio and caspase-3 (pro-apoptotic) activity were reduced in the amygdala (lateral and medial), as well as in the dentate gyrus in the probiotics group when compared with the placebo. Akt activity (anti-apoptotic) was increased in these same three regions. No significant difference was observed in Ca1 and Ca3 for the different markers measured. In conclusion, the probiotics L. helveticus and B. longum, given in combination as preventive therapy, reduced the predisposition of apoptosis found in different cerebral regions following a MI.
TI  - Lactic acid production from cheese whey by immobilized bacteria.
AB  - The performance of immobilized Bifidobacterium longum in sodium alginate beads and on a spiral-sheet bioreactor for the production of lactic acid from cheese whey was evaluated. Lactose utilization and lactic acid yield of B. longum were compared with those of Lactobacillus helveticus. B. longum immobilized in sodium alginate beads showed better performance in lactose utilization and lactic acid yield than L. helveticus. In the spiral-sheet bioreactor, a lactose conversion ratio of 79% and lactic acid yield of 0.84 g of lactic acid/g of lactose utilized were obtained during the first run with the immobilized L. helveticus. A lactose conversion ratio of 69% and lactic acid yield of 0.51 g of lactic acid/g of lactose utilized were obtained during the first run with immobilized B. longum in the spiral-sheet bioreactor. In producing lactic acid L. helveticus performed better when using the Spiral Sheet Bioreactor and B. longum showed better performance with gel bead immobilization. Because B. longum is a very promising new bacterium for lactic acid production from cheese whey, its optimum fermentation conditions such as pH and metabolic pathway need to be studied further. The ultrafiltration tests have shown that 94% of the cell and cheese whey proteins were retained by membranes with a mol wt cutoff of 5 and 20 KDa.
