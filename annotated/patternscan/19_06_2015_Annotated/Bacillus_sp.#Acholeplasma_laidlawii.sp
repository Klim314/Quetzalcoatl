TI  == a new ascochlorin derivative from cylindrocarpon sp. fki-4602.
AB  == cylindrol a(5), a new ascochlorin congener, was isolated along with 14 known compounds from the culture broth of cylindrocarpon sp. fki-4602 by solvent extraction, octadecylsilane column chromatography and hplc. the structure of cylindrol a(5) was elucidated by spectral analyses, including nmr. the compound has an ascochlorin skeleton consisting of a resorcin aldehyde and a cyclohexanone moieties. cylindrol a(5) showed moderate antimicrobial activity against bacillus  subtilis, kocuria rhizophila, mycobacterium smegmatis and acholeplasma laidlawii. the biosynthetic pathway to cylindrol a(5) was deduced from the 14 isolated metabolites of the fungal strain.

TI  == taxonomic status of the agent of cereals pale-green dwarf and proposition of founding in the class of mollicutes, of the order iii acholeplasmatales, family i acholeplasmataceae, genus ii pluraplasma gen. nov., and its first species pluraplasma granulum sp. nov.
AB  == the paper includes the data concerning the taxonomic status of the agent of cereals pale-green dwarf (acpgd) which has been defined as the phytopathogenic variant of the mollicute acholeplasma laidlawii and called a. laidlawii var. granulum. since besides phytopathogenicity acpgd has such fundamental differences from a.laidlawii as: a very large genome of 2200 thousand pairs of nucleotides (t.p.n.) to 2310 t.p.n. that practically equals a sum of genomes of a. laidlawii  (1600 t.p.n.) and phytoplasmas (710 t.p.n.); two forms of dna-dependent rna-polymerase (one form functions in a. laidlawii); a capacity to form extracellular fructosobisphos-phatase which looks like its hypothetical phylogenetic precursor a bacteria bacillus subtilis; availability of numerous fermentative activities which are absent in acholeplasmas; peculiar relation to sterols availability in nutrient media that is not characteristic of all the known acholeplasmas; extremely rich, as to quantity and quality, composition of antigens to react almost homologously with antibodies to representatives of acholeplasma genus and separate species of mycoplasma genus; great similarity (above 88 %) of sequences of 16s rrna of acpgd and representatives of phytoplasma genus and other properties described in the paper, so it is concluded, that proceeding from its characteristics, acpgd cannot be referred to either of the existing genera of the mollicules class, because according to all its features this mollicute is a transition form of the microorganism, it is the hitherto unknown chain between these genera of mollicutes and sporiferous bacteria, acpgd  is a probable representative of mollicute precursor with genome of about 1600 t.p.n. and, first of all, of genera acholeplasma and phytoplasma which arised as  a result of the evolutionary splitting of its genome. on this basis, it is recommended to found for acpgd in the mollicutes class, order iii acholeplasmatales, family i acholeplasmataceae, a new genus ii pluraplasma gen. nov. and its first species pluraplasma granulum sp. nov., the strain 118 being its typical representative.

TI  == phenatic acids a and b, new potentiators of antifungal miconazole activity produced by streptomyces sp. k03-0132.
AB  == two new phenols, designated phenatic acids a and b, were isolated along with known actiphenol, from the culture of streptomyces sp. k03-0132 by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and hplc. their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including mainly various nmr experiments. they have a common 1-hydroxy 2, 4-dimethyl benzene ring. these compounds potentiate miconazole activity against candida albicans. phenatic acid b also showed moderate antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus  aureus, bacteroides fragilis and acholeplasma laidlawii.

TI  == studies on bacterial cell wall inhibitors. vi. screening method for the specific  inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis.
AB  == a screening method was established for selecting new specific inhibitors of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. in the primary test, culture broths  of soil isolates were selected based on relative microbial activity. a culture, to be retained, must be active against bacillus subtilis and lack activities against acholeplasma laidawii. in the secondary test, inhibitors of bacterial cell wall synthesis were identified by their ability to prevent the incorporation of meso-[3h]diaminopimelic acid but not to prevent the incorporation of l-[4c]leucine into the acid-insoluble macromolecular fraction of growing cells of bacillus sp. atcc 21206 (dpm-). as the tertiary test, inhibitors with molecular weights under 1,000 were selected by passage through a diaflo um-2 membrane. by this screening procedure, six known antibiotics and one new one were picked out from ten thousand soil isolates.
