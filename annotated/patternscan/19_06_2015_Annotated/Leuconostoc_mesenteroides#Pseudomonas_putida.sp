TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == identification and evaluation of volatile compounds of vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged beef strip loins.
AB  == beef strip loins were packaged and stored for up to 28 days at 3 degrees c in high-oxygen barrier film under vacuum and in 100% co(2), 40% co(2)/60% n(2) and 20% co(2)/80% o(2). as storage progressed, loins packaged and stored in 20% co(2)/80% o(2) developed strong off-odors. 1-hexene, methyl thiirane, ethyl acetate, benzene and 1-heptene were detected in these packaged loins beginning at 7 to 14 days of storage. with the exception of 1-hexene, these compounds were not consistently detected in loins stored in vacuum, in 100% co(2), or in 40% co(2)/60% n(2), and these packaged loins developed much less off-odor during storage than loins packaged and stored in 20% co(2)/80% o(2). a large number of volatile compounds from the headspace of the packaged loins originated from the packaging material. lactobacillus plantarum became the dominant flora on loins stored under vacuum and under 40% co(2)/60% n(2) while leuconostoc mesenteroides  subsp. mesenteroides predominated in loins stored in 100% co(2). pseudomonas putida eventually dominated on loins stored in 20% co(2)/80% o(2).
