TI  - A new shuttle plasmid that stably replicates in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - We have developed a new shuttle plasmid, designated as pLK1-MCS that can be replicated in both Clostridium acetobutylicum and Escherichia coli, by combining the pUB110 and pUC19 plasmids. Plasmid pLK1-MCS was more stably replicated than previously reported plasmids containing either the pIM13 or the pAMbeta1 replicon in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure. The transfer frequency of pLK1-MCS into C. acetobutylicum was similar to the transfer frequency of other shuttle plasmids. We complemented C. acetobutylicum ML1 (that does not produce solvents such as acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) due to loss of the megaplasmid pSOL1 harboring the adhE1-ctfAB-adc operon) by introducing pLK1-MCS carrying the adhE1-ctfAB-adc operon into C. acetobutylicum ML1. The transformed cells were able to resume anaerobic solvent production, indicating that the new shuttle plasmid has the potential for practical use in microbial biotechnology.
TI  - Improved n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli by controlling membrane related  functions.
AB  - As the increasing demand from both chemical and fuel markets, the interest in producing n-butanol using biological route has been rejuvenated to engineer an economical fermentation process, competing with the currently-dominant chemical synthesis. n-Butanol has been traditionally produced from the ABE fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum. This system, however, is not economically feasible due to its limited efficiency and the lack of genetic modification tools for further improvements. Alternatively, n-butanol synthesis pathway was successfully transferred into Escherichia coli and rapidly improved to reach a level of production comparable to the native producer. Nevertheless, the toxicity of n-butanol has become a common issue that either approach has to deal with. Previously, we reported our success in improving n-butanol tolerance in E. coli by engineering an Artificial Transcription Factor (ATF) that can modify the expression level of multiple targets simultaneously and improved the n-butanol tolerance of MG1655 strain to 1.5% (vol/vol) n-butanol. However, it was observed that some possible n-butanol tolerance mechanisms did not occurred upon the ATF expression, especially the membrane-related functions such as the homeoviscous adaptation, iron uptaking system, and efflux pump system. In this work, we attempted to enhance the n-butanol tolerance associated with the ATF by combining it with the membrane-related functions in E. coli, including the overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes, iron-uptaking protein FeoA, and introducing a SrpABC efflux pump from Pseudomonas putida into E. coli. The synergistic effect of this combinatorial approach led to 4, 5, and 9-fold improved growths in the cultures containing 1, 1.5, and 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol, respectively, of an MG1655 knockout strain engineered for n-butanol production, and expanded the tolerance limit to 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol.
TI  - Comparative transcriptome analysis between csrA-disruption Clostridium acetobutylicum and its parent strain.
AB  - The genome of Clostridium acetobutylicum contains the gene encoding CsrA, a carbon storage regulator. We investigated the function of CsrA in C. acetobutylicum by insertionally inactivating the encoding gene, CA_C2209 using the ClosTron. Disruption of csrA obviously decreases the growth of the organism and reduces the yield of acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABEs). Like the csrA in Escherichia coli, RNA-seq and beta-galactosidase analysis revealed that csrA in C. acetobutylicum was closely involved in regulating multiple pathways including flagella assembly, oligopeptide transporting, iron uptake, and central carbon metabolism. It has also been newly demonstrated that csrA in C. acetobutylicum is related to the regulation of pathways involved in the phosphotransferase transporting systems, synthesis of riboflavin, and stage III sporulation. This research represented the first investigation of global regulation by CsrA in the strain belonging to Gram-positive bacteria through transcriptome analysis and provided the important theoretical evidence for improving solvent production by transcriptor engineering in C. acetobutylicum.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of an ATP-neutral Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway in Corynebacterium glutamicum: growth restoration by an adaptive point mutation in NADH dehydrogenase.
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum uses the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway of glycolysis  and gains 2 mol of ATP per mol of glucose by substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). To engineer glycolysis without net ATP formation by SLP, endogenous phosphorylating NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was replaced by nonphosphorylating NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapN) from Clostridium acetobutylicum, which irreversibly converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) without generating ATP. As shown recently (S. Takeno, R. Murata, R. Kobayashi, S. Mitsuhashi, and M. Ikeda, Appl Environ Microbiol 76:7154-7160, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01464-10), this ATP-neutral, NADPH-generating glycolytic pathway did not allow for the growth of Corynebacterium glutamicum with glucose as the sole carbon source unless hitherto unknown suppressor mutations occurred; however, these mutations were not disclosed. In the present study, a suppressor mutation was identified, and it was shown that heterologous expression of udhA encoding soluble transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli partly restored growth, suggesting that growth was inhibited by NADPH accumulation. Moreover, genome sequence analysis of second-site suppressor mutants that were able to grow faster with glucose revealed a single point mutation in the gene of non-proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH-II) leading to the amino acid change D213G, which was shared by these suppressor mutants. Since related NDH-II enzymes accepting NADPH as the substrate possess asparagine or glutamine residues at this position, D213G, D213N, and D213Q variants of C. glutamicum NDH-II were constructed and were shown to oxidize NADPH in addition to NADH. Taking these findings together, ATP-neutral glycolysis by the replacement of endogenous NAD-dependent GAPDH with NADP-dependent GapN became possible via oxidation of NADPH formed in this pathway by mutant NADPH-accepting NDH-II(D213G) and thus by coupling to electron transport phosphorylation (ETP).
TI  - A synthetic O2 -tolerant butanol pathway exploiting native fatty acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Several synthetic metabolic pathways for butanol synthesis have been reported in  Escherichia coli by modification of the native CoA-dependent pathway from selected Clostridium species. These pathways are all dependent on the O2 -sensitive AdhE2 enzyme from Clostridium acetobutylicum that catalyzes the sequential reduction of both butyryl-CoA and butyraldehyde. We constructed an O2 -tolerant butanol pathway based on the activities of an ACP-thioesterase, acting on butyryl-ACP in the native fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, and a promiscuous carboxylic acid reductase. The pathway was genetically optimized by screening a series of bacterial acyl-ACP thioesterases and also by modification of the physical growth parameters. In order to evaluate the potential of the pathway for butanol production, the ACP-dependent butanol pathway was compared with a previously established CoA-dependent pathway. The effect of (1) O2 -availability, (2) media, and (3) co-expression of aldehyde reductases was evaluated systematically demonstrating varying and contrasting functionality between the ACP- and CoA-dependent pathways. The yield of butanol from the ACP-dependent pathway was stimulated by enhanced O2 -availability, in contrast to the CoA-dependent pathway, which did not function well under aerobic conditions. Similarly, whilst the CoA-dependent pathway only performed well in complex media, the ACP-dependent pathway was not influenced by the choice of media except in the absence of O2 . A combination of a thioesterase from Bacteroides fragilis and the aldehyde reductase, ahr, from E. coli resulted in the greatest yield of butanol. A product titer of ~300 mg/L was obtained in 24 h under optimal batch growth conditions, in most cases exceeding the performance of the reference CoA-pathway when evaluated under equivalent conditions.
TI  - Engineering cellular robustness of microbes by introducing the GroESL chaperonins from extremophilic bacteria.
AB  - The cellular robustness is a big concern for efficient microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals. In this study, the groESL genes from extremophilic bacteria were found to serve as transplantable stress-response elements to improve diverse types of stress-tolerances of other microbes. By overexpressing the groESL from the solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli, its thermo-tolerance and ethanol-tolerance were significantly increased. Meanwhile, the groESL from the thermophilic Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis endowed Clostridium acetobutylicum with improved corn cob hydrolysates (CCH)-tolerance as well as elevated butanol productivity. The chaperonins GroESL have been widely considered as cellular stress-response proteins and overexpression of native groESL has been proven to improve cellular tolerances facing various stresses. Here we found that the groESL genes from extremophilic bacteria were superior to the native ones, possibly because they have adapted to the environmental stresses during long-term natural evolution. Moreover, our results also revealed that different extreme groESL genes performed quite different in different microbes. Thus the relation and compatibility between the extremophiles and the host must be considered for selection of the proper groESL for engineering microbial robustness.
TI  - Steady-state metabolite concentrations reflect a balance between maximizing enzyme efficiency and minimizing total metabolite load.
AB  - Steady-state metabolite concentrations in a microorganism typically span several  orders of magnitude. The underlying principles governing these concentrations remain poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that observed variation can be explained in terms of a compromise between factors that favor minimizing metabolite pool sizes (e.g. limited solvent capacity) and the need to effectively utilize existing enzymes. The latter requires adequate thermodynamic driving force in metabolic reactions so that forward flux substantially exceeds reverse flux. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method, metabolic tug-of-war (mTOW), which computes steady-state metabolite concentrations in microorganisms on a genome-scale. mTOW is shown to explain up to 55% of the observed variation in measured metabolite concentrations in E. coli and C. acetobutylicum across various growth media. Our approach, based strictly on first thermodynamic principles, is the first method that successfully predicts high-throughput metabolite concentration data in bacteria across conditions.
TI  - Microbial production of short-chain alkanes.
AB  - Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems  have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-ACPs, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. A modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of SCAs consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester synthase (atfA) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE(mut)).
TI  - Engineering a synthetic pathway in cyanobacteria for isopropanol production directly from carbon dioxide and light.
AB  - Production of alternate fuels or chemicals directly from solar energy and carbon  dioxide using engineered cyanobacteria is an attractive method to reduce petroleum dependency and minimize carbon emissions. Here, we constructed a synthetic pathway composed of acetyl-CoA acetyl transferase (encoded by thl), acetoacetyl-CoA transferase (encoded by atoAD), acetoacetate decarboxylase (encoded by adc) and secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by adh) in Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942 to produce isopropanol. The enzyme-coding genes, heterogeneously originating from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (thl and adc), Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 (atoAD) and Clostridium beijerinckii (adh), were integrated into the S. elongatus genome. Under the optimized production conditions, the engineered cyanobacteria produced 26.5 mg/L of isopropanol after 9 days.
TI  - Engineering E. coli strain for conversion of short chain fatty acids to bioalcohols.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent progress in production of various biofuel precursors and molecules, such as fatty acids, alcohols and alka(e)nes, is a significant step forward for replacing the fossil fuels with renewable fuels. A two-step process, where fatty acids from sugars are produced in the first step and then converted to corresponding biofuel molecules in the second step, seems more viable and attractive at this stage. We have engineered an Escherichia coli strain to take care of the second step for converting short chain fatty acids into corresponding alcohols by using butyrate kinase (Buk), phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE2) from Clostridium acetobutylicum. RESULTS: The engineered E. coli was able to convert butyric acid and other short chain fatty acids of chain length C3 to C7 into corresponding alcohols and the efficiency of conversion varied with different E. coli strain type. Glycerol proved to be a better donor of ATP and electron as compared to glucose for converting butyric acid to butanol. The engineered E. coli was able to tolerate up to 100 mM butyric acid and produced butanol with the conversion rate close to 100% under anaerobic condition. Deletion of native genes, such as fumarate reductase (frdA) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE), responsible for side products succinate and ethanol, which act as electron sink and could compete with butyric acid uptake, did not improve the butanol production efficiency. Indigenous acyl-CoA synthetase (fadD) was found to play no role in the conversion of butyric acid to butanol. Engineered E. coli was cultivated in a bioreactor under controlled condition where 60 mM butanol was produced within 24 h of cultivation. A continuous bioreactor with the provision of cell recycling allowed the continuous production of butanol at the average productivity of 7.6 mmol/l/h until 240 h. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli engineered with the pathway from C. acetobutylicum could efficiently convert butyric acid to butanol. Other short chain fatty acids with the chain length of C3 to C7 were also converted to the corresponding alcohols. The ability of engineered strain to convert butyric acid to butanol continuously demonstrates commercial significance of the system.
TI  - Prospective and development of butanol as an advanced biofuel.
AB  - Butanol has been acknowledged as an advanced biofuel, but its production through  acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation by clostridia is still not economically competitive, due to low butanol yield and titer. In this article, update progress in butanol production is reviewed. Low price and sustainable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic residues and dedicated energy crops are needed for butanol production at large scale to save feedstock cost, but processes are more complicated, compared to those established for ABE fermentation from sugar- and starch-based feedstocks. While rational designs targeting individual genes, enzymes or pathways are effective for improving butanol yield, global and systems strategies are more reasonable for engineering strains with stress tolerance controlled by multigenes. Compared to solvent-producing clostridia, engineering heterologous species such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with butanol pathway might be a solution for eliminating the formation of major byproducts acetone and ethanol so that butanol yield can be improved significantly. Although batch fermentation has been practiced for butanol production in industry, continuous operation is more productive for large scale production of butanol as a biofuel, but a single chemostat bioreactor cannot achieve this goal for the biphasic ABE fermentation, and tanks-in-series systems should be optimized for alternative feedstocks and new strains. Moreover, energy saving is limited for the distillation system, even total solvents in the fermentation broth are increased significantly, since solvents are distilled to ~40% by the beer stripper, and more than 95% water is removed with the stillage without phase change, even with conventional distillation systems, needless to say that advanced chemical engineering technologies can distil solvents up to ~90% with the beer stripper, and the multistage pressure columns can well balance energy consumption for solvent fraction. Indeed, an increase in butanol titer with ABE fermentation can significantly save energy consumption for medium sterilization and stillage treatment, since concentrated medium can be used, and consequently total mass flow with production systems can be reduced. As for various in situ butanol removal technologies, their energy efficiency, capital investment and contamination risk to the fermentation process need to be evaluated carefully.
TI  - Conversion of levulinic acid to 2-butanone by acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - In this study, a novel system for synthesis of 2-butanone from levulinic acid (gamma-keto-acid) via an enzymatic reaction was developed. Acetoacetate decarboxylase (AADC; E.C. 4.1.1.4) from Clostridium acetobutylicum was selected as a biocatalyst for decarboxylation of levulinic acid. The purified recombinant AADC from Escherichia coli successfully converted levulinic acid to 2-butanone with a conversion yield of 8.4-90.3 % depending on the amount of AADC under optimum conditions (30 degrees C and pH 5.0) despite that acetoacetate, a beta-keto-acid, is a natural substrate of AADC. In order to improve the catalytic efficiency, an AADC-mediator system was tested using methyl viologen, methylene blue, azure B, zinc ion, and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as mediators. Among them, methyl viologen showed the best performance, increasing the conversion yield up to 6.7-fold in comparison to that without methyl viologen. The results in this study are significant in the development of a renewable method for the synthesis of 2-butanone from biomass-derived chemical, levulinic acid, through enzymatic decarboxylation.
TI  - Butyrate production in engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic scaffolds.
AB  - Butyrate pathway was constructed in recombinant Escherichia coli using the genes  from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Treponema denticola. However, the pathway constructed from exogenous enzymes did not efficiently convert carbon flux to butyrate. Three steps of the productivity enhancement were attempted in this study. First, pathway engineering to delete metabolic pathways to by-products successfully improved the butyrate production. Second, synthetic scaffold protein that spatially co-localizes enzymes was introduced to improve the efficiency of the heterologous pathway enzymes, resulting in threefold improvement in butyrate production. Finally, further optimizations of inducer concentrations and pH adjustment were tried. The final titer of butyrate was 4.3 and 7.2 g/L under batch and fed-batch cultivation, respectively. This study demonstrated the importance of synthetic scaffold protein as a useful tool for optimization of heterologous butyrate pathway in E. coli.
TI  - Deriving metabolic engineering strategies from genome-scale modeling with flux ratio constraints.
AB  - Optimized production of bio-based fuels and chemicals from microbial cell factories is a central goal of systems metabolic engineering. To achieve this goal, a new computational method of using flux balance analysis with flux ratios (FBrAtio) was further developed in this research and applied to five case studies to evaluate and design metabolic engineering strategies. The approach was implemented using publicly available genome-scale metabolic flux models. Synthetic pathways were added to these models along with flux ratio constraints by FBrAtio to achieve increased (i) cellulose production from Arabidopsis thaliana; (ii) isobutanol production from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; (iii) acetone production from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803; (iv) H2 production from Escherichia coli MG1655; and (v) isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (IBE) production from engineered Clostridium acetobutylicum. The FBrAtio approach was applied to each case to simulate a metabolic engineering strategy already implemented experimentally, and flux ratios were continually adjusted to find (i) the end-limit of increased production using the existing strategy, (ii) new potential strategies to increase production, and (iii) the impact of these metabolic engineering strategies on product yield and culture growth. The FBrAtio approach has the potential to design "fine-tuned" metabolic engineering strategies in silico that can be implemented directly with available genomic tools.
TI  - Engineering of NADPH regenerators in Escherichia coli for enhanced biotransformation.
AB  - Efficient regeneration of NADPH is one of the limiting factors that constrain the productivity of biotransformation processes. In order to increase the availability of NADPH for enhanced biotransformation by engineered Escherichia coli, modulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and amplification of the transhydrogenases system have been conventionally attempted as primary solutions. Recently, other approaches for stimulating NADPH regeneration during glycolysis, such as replacement of native glyceradehdye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) with NADP-dependent GAPDH from Clostridium acetobutylicum and introduction of NADH kinase catalyzing direct phosphorylation of NADH to NADPH from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were attempted and resulted in remarkable impacts on NADPH-dependent bioprocesses. This review summarizes several metabolic engineering approaches used for improving the NADPH regenerating capacity in engineered E. coli for whole-cell-based bioprocesses and discusses the key features and progress of those attempts.
TI  - Resolving cell composition through simple measurements, genome-scale modeling, and a genetic algorithm.
AB  - The biochemical composition of a cell is very complex and dynamic. It varies greatly among different organisms and environmental conditions. Inclusion of proper cell composition data is critical for accurate genome-scale metabolic flux modeling using flux balance analysis (FBA). However, determining cell composition experimentally is currently time-consuming and resource intensive. In this chapter, a method for predicting cell composition using a genome-scale model and "easy to measure" culture data (e.g., glucose uptake rate, and specific growth rate) is presented. The method makes use of a genetic algorithm for nonlinear optimization of a biomass equation (a mathematical description of cell composition). As a case study, the method was used to optimize a biomass equation for Escherichia coli MG1655 under multiple growth environments. The availability of experimentally determined (13)C flux data allowed a direct comparison with FBA predicted fluxes through the TCA cycle. Results showed dramatic improvement upon optimization of the biomass equation. In a second case study, biomass equation optimization was also applied to Clostridium acetobutylicum, an organism with less available biochemical cell composition data in the literature. The method produced a biomass equation highly similar to one determined experimentally for the closely related Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - The biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  - Competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. Microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. These 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. In addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. Weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol). Whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: Pichia anomala, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas putida; specialists such as Dunaliella salina, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus spp. and other lactic acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs Gonyostomum semen and Microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Pantoea ananatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as Aspergillus spp., Salinibacter ruber and Haloquadratum walsbyi. Some microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. We propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as Synodropsis spp., Polypaecilum pisce, Metschnikowia orientalis, Salmonella spp., and Caulobacter crescentus. We show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. Microbial weed species are unlikely to emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. Specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.
TI  - Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase is coupled to light-independent hydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
AB  - In anaerobiosis, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii evolves molecular hydrogen (H(2)) as one of several fermentation products. H(2) is generated mostly by the [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase HYDA1, which uses plant type ferredoxin PETF/FDX1 (PETF) as an electron donor. Dark fermentation of the alga is mainly of the mixed acid type, because formate, ethanol, and acetate are generated by a pyruvate:formate lyase pathway similar to Escherichia coli. However, C. reinhardtii also possesses the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase PFR1, which, like pyruvate:formate lyase and HYDA1, is localized in the chloroplast. PFR1 has long been suggested to be responsible for the low but significant H(2) accumulation in the dark because the catalytic mechanism of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase involves the reduction of ferredoxin. With the aim of proving the biochemical feasibility of the postulated reaction, we have heterologously expressed the PFR1 gene in E. coli. Purified recombinant PFR1 is able to transfer electrons from pyruvate to HYDA1, using the ferredoxins PETF and FDX2 as electron carriers. The high reactivity of PFR1 toward oxaloacetate indicates that in vivo, fermentation might also be coupled to an anaerobically active glyoxylate cycle. Our results suggest that C. reinhardtii employs a clostridial type H(2) production pathway in the dark, especially because C. reinhardtii PFR1 was also able to allow H(2) evolution in reaction mixtures containing Clostridium acetobutylicum 2[4Fe-4S]-ferredoxin and [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase HYDA.
TI  - Volatility in mRNA secondary structure as a design principle for antisense.
AB  - Designing effective antisense sequences is a formidable problem. A method for predicting efficacious antisense holds the potential to provide fundamental insight into this biophysical process. More practically, such an understanding increases the chance of successful antisense design as well as saving considerable time, money and labor. The secondary structure of an mRNA molecule is believed to be in a constant state of flux, sampling several different suboptimal states. We hypothesized that particularly volatile regions might provide better accessibility for antisense targeting. A computational framework, GenAVERT was developed to evaluate this hypothesis. GenAVERT used UNAFold and RNAforester to generate and compare the predicted suboptimal structures of mRNA sequences. Subsequent analysis revealed regions that were particularly volatile in terms of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and thus potentially superior antisense targets due to their high accessibility. Several mRNA sequences with known natural antisense target sites as well as artificial antisense target sites were evaluated. Upon comparison, antisense sequences predicted based upon the volatility hypothesis closely matched those of the naturally occurring antisense, as well as those artificial target sites that provided efficient down-regulation. These results suggest that this strategy may provide a powerful new approach to antisense design.
TI  - Site saturation mutagenesis demonstrates a central role for cysteine 298 as proton donor to the catalytic site in CaHydA [FeFe]-hydrogenase.
AB  - [FeFe]-hydrogenases reversibly catalyse molecular hydrogen evolution by reduction of two protons. Proton supply to the catalytic site (H-cluster) is essential for enzymatic activity. Cysteine 298 is a highly conserved residue in all [FeFe]-hydrogenases; moreover C298 is structurally very close to the H-cluster and it is important for hydrogenase activity. Here, the function of C298 in catalysis was investigated in detail by means of site saturation mutagenesis, simultaneously studying the effect of C298 replacement with all other 19 amino acids and selecting for mutants with high retained activity. We demonstrated that efficient enzymatic turnover was maintained only when C298 was replaced by aspartic acid, despite the structural diversity between the two residues. Purified CaHydA C298D does not show any significant structural difference in terms of secondary structure and iron incorporation, demonstrating that the mutation does not affect the overall protein fold. C298D retains the hydrogen evolution activity with a decrease of k(cat) only by 2-fold at pH 8.0 and it caused a shift of the optimum pH from 8.0 to 7.0. Moreover, the oxygen inactivation rate was not affected demonstrating that the mutation does not influence O(2) diffusion to the active site or its reactivity with the H-cluster. Our results clearly demonstrate that, in order to maintain the catalytic efficiency and the high turnover number typical of [FeFe] hydrogenases, the highly conserved C298 can be replaced only by another ionisable residue with similar steric hindrance, giving evidence of its involvement in the catalytic function of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in agreement with an essential role in proton transfer to the active site.
TI  - Thiolase engineering for enhanced butanol production in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Biosynthetic thiolases catalyze the condensation of two molecules acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA and represent key enzymes for carbon-carbon bond forming metabolic pathways. An important biotechnological example of such a pathway is the clostridial n-butanol production, comprising various natural constraints that limit titer, yield, and productivity. In this study, the thiolase of Clostridium acetobutylicum, the model organism for solventogenic clostridia, was specifically engineered for reduced sensitivity towards its physiological inhibitor coenzyme A (CoA-SH). A high-throughput screening assay in 96-well microtiter plates was developed employing Escherichia coli as host cells for expression of a mutant thiolase gene library. Screening of this library resulted in the identification of a thiolase derivative with significantly increased activity in the presence of free CoA-SH. This optimized thiolase comprised three amino acid substitutions (R133G, H156N, G222V) and its gene was expressed in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 to assess the effect of reduced CoA-SH sensitivity on solvent production. In addition to a clearly delayed ethanol and acetone formation, the ethanol and butanol titers were increased by 46% and 18%, respectively, while the final acetone concentrations were similar to the vector control strain. These results demonstrate that thiolase engineering constitutes a suitable methodology applicable to improve clostridial butanol production, but other biosynthetic pathways involving thiolase-mediated carbon flux limitations might also be subjected to this new metabolic engineering approach.
TI  - Novel system for efficient isolation of Clostridium double-crossover allelic exchange mutants enabling markerless chromosomal gene deletions and DNA integration.
AB  - Isolation of Clostridium mutants based on gene replacement via allelic exchange remains a major limitation for this important genus. Use of a heterologous counterselection marker can facilitate the identification of the generally rare allelic exchange events. We report on the development of an inducible counterselection marker and describe its utility and broad potential in quickly and efficiently generating markerless DNA deletions and integrations at any genomic locus without the need for auxotrophic mutants or the use of the mobile group II introns. This system is based on a codon-optimized mazF toxin gene from Escherichia coli under the control of a lactose-inducible promoter from Clostridium perfringens. This system is potentially applicable to almost all members of the genus Clostridium due to their similarly low genomic GC content and comparable codon usage. We isolated all allelic-exchange-based gene deletions (ca_p0167, sigF, and sigK) or disruptions (ca_p0157 and sigF) we attempted and integrated a 3.6-kb heterologous DNA sequence (made up of a Clostridium ljungdahlii 2.1-kb formate dehydrogenase [fdh] gene plus a FLP recombination target [FRT]-flanked thiamphenicol resistance marker) into the Clostridium acetobutylicum chromosome. Furthermore, we report on the development of a plasmid system with inducible segregational instability, thus enabling efficient deployment of the FLP-FRT system to generate markerless deletion or integration mutants. This enabled expeditious deletion of the thiamphenicol resistance marker from the fdh integrant strain as well as the sigK deletion strain. More generally, our system can potentially be applied to other organisms with underdeveloped genetic tools.
TI  - Biochemical analysis of the interactions between the proteins involved in the [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation process.
AB  - [FeFe]-hydrogenases are iron-sulfur proteins characterized by a complex active site, the H-cluster, whose assembly requires three conserved maturases. HydE and HydG are radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes that chemically modify a H-cluster precursor on HydF, a GTPase with a dual role of scaffold on which this precursor is synthesized, and carrier to transfer it to the hydrogenase. Coordinate structural and functional relationships between HydF and the two other maturases are crucial for the H-cluster assembly. However, to date only qualitative analysis of this protein network have been provided. In this work we showed that the interactions of HydE and HydG with HydF are distinct events, likely occurring in a precise functional order driven by different kinetic properties, independently of the HydF GTPase activity, which is instead involved in the dissociation of the maturases from the scaffold. We also found that HydF is able to interact with the hydrogenase only when co-expressed with the two other maturases, indicating that under these conditions it harbors per se all the structural elements needed to transfer the H-cluster precursor, thus completing the maturation process. These results open new working perspectives aimed at improving the knowledge of how these complex metalloenzymes are biosynthesized.
TI  - A modified pathway for the production of acetone in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A modified synthetic acetone operon was constructed. It consists of two genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum (thlA coding for thiolase and adc coding for acetoacetate decarboxylase) and one from Bacillus subtilis or Haemophilus influenzae (teII(srf) or ybgC, respectively, for thioesterase). Expression of this operon in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of acetone starting from the common metabolite acetyl-CoA via acetoacetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. The thioesterases do not need a CoA acceptor for acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolysis. Thus, in contrast to the classic acetone pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum and related microorganisms which employ a CoA transferase, the new pathway is acetate independent. The genetic background of the host strains was crucial. Only E. coli strains HB101 and WL3 were able to produce acetone via the modified plasmid based pathway, up to 64mM and 42mM in 5-ml cultures, respectively. Using glucose fed-batch cultures the concentration could be increased up to 122mM acetone with HB101 carrying the recombinant plasmid pUC19ayt (thioesterase from H. influenzae). The formation of acetone led to a decreased acetate production by E. coli.
TI  - A selection platform for carbon chain elongation using the CoA-dependent pathway  to produce linear higher alcohols.
AB  - Production of green chemicals and fuels using metabolically engineered organisms  has been a promising alternative to petroleum-based production. Higher chain alcohols (C4-C8) are of interest because they can be used as chemical feedstock as well as fuels. Recently, the feasibility of n-hexanol synthesis using Escherichia coli has been demonstrated by extending the modified Clostridium CoA-dependent n-butanol synthesis pathway, thereby elongating carbon chain length via reactions in reversed beta-oxidation, (or beta-reduction). Here, we developed an anaerobic growth selection platform that allows selection or enrichment of enzymes for increased synthesis of C6 and C8 linear alcohols. Using this selection, we were able to improve the carbon flux towards the synthesis of C6 and C8 acyl-CoA intermediates. Replacement of the original enzyme Clostridium acetobutylicum Hbd with Ralstonia eutropha homologue PaaH1 increased production of n-hexanol by 10-fold. Further directed evolution by random mutagenesis of PaaH1 improved n-hexanol and n-octanol production. This anaerobic growth selection platform may be useful for selecting enzymes for production of long-chain alcohols and acids using this CoA-dependent pathway.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of key genes of butanol synthetic pathway in Escherichia  coli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We constructed a recombinant Escherichia coli strain for butanol production by cloning the cDNA sequence of the key butanol synthetic pathway genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824. METHODS: We amplified the genes of thil, adhE2 and BCS operon by PCR with C. acetobutylicum ATCC824 genome as a template. We constructed the recombinant strain E. coli pBAT (BCS operon-adhE2-thil/pTrc99a/MG1655). We used 0.1 mmol/l Isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce the recombinant E. coli pBAT for 5 h for recombinant protein expression. We measured acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (THL), beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBD), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (CRT), butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD) and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (BYDH)/butanol dehydrogenase (BDH) activities in E. coli MG1655 and E. coli pBAT. The fermentation of E. coli pBAT was done in flask in aerobic, micro-aerobic and anaerobic mode separately. RESULTS: In the recombinant E. coli pBAT, THL activity was 0.160 U/mg protein, about 30 times higher than that of E. coli MG1655. HBD activity was 5 times higher than that of E. coli MG1655. CRT activity was 1.53 U/mg protein whereas not detectable in E. coli MG1655. BCD activity was about 32 times higher than that of E. coli MG1655. In addition, the results show that n-butanol could be produced under anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions. The maximum n-buntanol concentration of 84 mg/l was detected in cultivation broth. CONCLUSION: The key genes of butanol synthetic pathway were expressed in E. coli and the recombinant strains would offer an alternative strategy for butanol biosynthesis.
TI  - Engineering a homobutanol fermentation pathway in Escherichia coli EG03.
AB  - A homobutanol fermentation pathway was engineered in a derivative of Escherichia  coli B (glucose [glycolysis] => 2 pyruvate + 2 NADH; pyruvate [pyruvate dehydrogenase] => acetyl-CoA + NADH; 2 acetyl-CoA [butanol pathway enzymes] + 4 NADH => butanol; summary stoichiometry: glucose => butanol). Initially, the native fermentation pathways were eliminated from E. coli B by deleting the genes encoding for lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), acetate kinase (ackA), fumarate reductase (frdABCD), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB), and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE), and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (aceEF-lpd) was anaerobically expressed through promoter replacement. The resulting strain, E. coli EG03 (DeltafrdABCD DeltaldhA DeltaackA DeltapflB Delta adhE DeltapdhR ::pflBp6-aceEF-lpd DeltamgsA), could generate 4 NADH for every glucose oxidized to two acetyl-CoA through glycolysis and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, EG03 lost its ability for anaerobic growth due to the lack of NADH oxidation pathways. When the butanol pathway genes that encode for acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (thiL), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (hbd), crotonase (crt), butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (bcd, etfA, etfB), and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (adheII) were cloned from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, and expressed in E. coli EG03, a balanced NADH oxidation pathway was established for homobutanol fermentation (glucose => 4 NADH + 2 acetyl-CoA => butanol). This strain was able to convert glucose to butanol (1,254 mg l(-1)) under anaerobic condition.
TI  - Genomic sequence of bacteriophage ATCC 8074-B1 and activity of its endolysin and  engineered variants against Clostridium sporogenes.
AB  - Lytic bacteriophage ATCC 8074-B1 produces large plaques on its host Clostridium sporogenes. Sequencing of the 47,595-bp genome allowed the identification of 82 putative open reading frames, including those encoding proteins for head and tail morphogenesis and lysis. However, sequences commonly associated with lysogeny were absent. ORF 22 encodes an endolysin, CS74L, that shows homology to N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases, and when expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein causes effective lysis of C. sporogenes cells when added externally. CS74L was also active on Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The catalytic domain expressed alone (CS74L(1-177)) exhibited a similar activity and the same host range as the full-length endolysin. A chimeric endolysin consisting of the CS74L catalytic domain fused to the C-terminal domain of endolysin CD27L, derived from Clostridium difficile bacteriophage PhiCD27, was produced. This chimera (CSCD) lysed C. sporogenes cells with an activity equivalent to that of the catalytic domain alone. In contrast, the CD27L C-terminal domain reduced the efficacy of the CS74L catalytic domain when tested against C. tyrobutyricum. The addition of the CD27L C-terminal domain did not enable the lysin to target C. difficile or other CD27L-sensitive bacteria.
TI  - Integration of DNA into bacterial chromosomes from plasmids without a counter-selection marker.
AB  - Most bacteria can only be transformed with circular plasmids, so robust DNA integration methods for these rely upon selection of single-crossover clones followed by counter-selection of double-crossover clones. To overcome the limited availability of heterologous counter-selection markers, here we explore novel DNA integration strategies that do not employ them, and instead exploit (i) activation or inactivation of genes leading to a selectable phenotype, and (ii) asymmetrical regions of homology to control the order of recombination events. We focus here on the industrial biofuel-producing bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum, which previously lacked robust integration tools, but the approach we have developed is broadly applicable. Large sequences can be delivered in a series of steps, as we demonstrate by inserting the chromosome of phage lambda (minus a region apparently unstable in Escherichia coli in our cloning context) into the chromosome of C. acetobutylicum in three steps. This work should open the way to reliable integration of DNA including large synthetic constructs in diverse microorganisms.
TI  - Improving fatty acid production in Escherichia coli through the overexpression of malonyl coA-acyl carrier protein transacylase.
AB  - The microbial biosynthesis of free fatty acid, which can be used as precursors for the production of fuels or chemicals from renewable carbon sources, has attracted significant attention in recent years. Free fatty acids can be produced by introducing an acyl-carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase (TE) gene into Escherichia coli. The first committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis is the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase followed by the conversion of malonyl-CoA to malonyl-ACP through the enzyme malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCT; FabD). The E. coli fabD gene encoding MCT has been cloned and studied. However, the effect of FabD overexpression in a fatty acid overproducing strain has not been examined. In this study, we examined the effect of FabD overexpression in a fatty acid overproducing strain carrying an acyl-ACP TE. Specifically, the effect of overexpressing a fabD gene from four different organisms on fatty acid production was compared. The strains carrying a fabD gene from E. coli, Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680, or Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) improved the free fatty acid production; these three strains produced more free fatty acids, about 11% more, than the control strain. The strain carrying a fabD gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, however, produced similar quantities of free fatty acids as the control strain. In addition, the three FabD overexpressed strains also have higher fatty acid/glucose yields. The results suggested that FabD overexpression can be used to improve free fatty acid production by increasing the malonyl-ACP availability.
TI  - Peptidoglycan turnover and recycling in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cells are protected by an exoskeleton, the stabilizing and shape-maintaining cell wall, consisting of the complex macromolecule peptidoglycan. In view of its function, it could be assumed that the cell wall is a static structure. In truth, however, it is steadily broken down by peptidoglycan-cleaving enzymes during cell growth. In this process, named cell wall turnover, in one generation up to half of the preexisting peptidoglycan of a bacterial cell is released from the wall. This would result in a massive loss of cell material, if turnover products were not be taken up and recovered. Indeed, in the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, peptidoglycan recovery has been recognized as a complex pathway, named cell wall recycling. It involves about a dozen dedicated recycling enzymes that convey cell wall turnover products to peptidoglycan synthesis or energy pathways. Whether Gram-positive bacteria also recover their cell wall is currently questioned. Given the much larger portion of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, however, recovery of the wall material would provide an even greater benefit in these organisms compared to Gram-negatives. Consistently, in many Gram-positives, orthologs of recycling enzymes were identified, indicating that the cell wall may also be recycled in these organisms. This mini-review provides a compilation of information about cell wall turnover and recycling in Gram-positive bacteria during cell growth and division, including recent findings relating to muropeptide recovery in Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum from our group. Furthermore, the impact of cell wall turnover and recycling on biotechnological processes is discussed.
TI  - Characterization of an N-acetylmuramic acid/N-acetylglucosamine kinase of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - We report here the cloning and characterization of a cytoplasmic kinase of Clostridium acetobutylicum, named MurK (for murein sugar kinase). The enzyme has a unique specificity for both amino sugars of the bacterial cell wall, N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which are phosphorylated at the 6-hydroxyl group. Kinetic analyses revealed Km values of 190 and 127 muM for MurNAc and GlcNAc, respectively, and a kcat value (65.0 s(-1)) that was 1.5-fold higher for the latter substrate. Neither the non-N-acetylated forms of the cell wall sugars, i.e., glucosamine and/or muramic acid, nor epimeric hexoses or 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc were substrates for the enzyme. MurK displays low overall amino acid sequence identity (24%) with human GlcNAc kinase and is the first characterized bacterial representative of the BcrAD/BadFG-like ATPase family. We propose a role of MurK in the recovery of muropeptides during cell wall rescue in C. acetobutylicum. The kinase was applied for high-sensitive detection of the amino sugars in cell wall preparations by radioactive phosphorylation.
TI  - Enzyme mechanism as a kinetic control element for designing synthetic biofuel pathways.
AB  - Living systems have evolved remarkable molecular functions that can be redesigned for in vivo chemical synthesis as we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biochemical principles for de novo construction of synthetic pathways. We have focused on developing pathways for next-generation biofuels as they require carbon to be channeled to product at quantitative yields. However, these fatty acid-inspired pathways must manage the highly reversible nature of the enzyme components. For targets in the biodiesel range, the equilibrium can be driven to completion by physical sequestration of an insoluble product, which is a mechanism unavailable to soluble gasoline-sized products. In this work, we report the construction of a chimeric pathway assembled from three different organisms for the high-level production of n-butanol (4,650 +/- 720 mg l(-)(1)) that uses an enzymatic chemical reaction mechanism in place of a physical step as a kinetic control element to achieve high yields from glucose (28%).
TI  - Engineering the robustness of Clostridium acetobutylicum by introducing glutathione biosynthetic capability.
AB  - To improve the aero- and solvent tolerance of the solvent-producing Clostridium acetobutylicum, glutathione biosynthetic capability was introduced into C. acetobutylicum DSM1731 by cloning and over-expressing the gshAB genes from Escherichia coli. Strain DSM1731(pITAB) produces glutathione, and shows a significantly improved survival upon aeration and butanol challenge, as compared with the control. In addition, strain DSM1731(pITAB) exhibited an improved butanol tolerance and an increased butanol production capability, as compared with the recombinant strains with only gshA or gshB gene. These results illustrated that introducing glutathione biosynthetic pathway, which is redundant for the metabolism of C. acetobutylicum, can increase the robustness of the host to achieve a better solvent production.
TI  - Improving the Clostridium acetobutylicum butanol fermentation by engineering the  strain for co-production of riboflavin.
AB  - Solvent-producing clostridia are well known for their capacity to use a wide variety of renewable biomass and agricultural waste materials for biobutanol production. To investigate the possibility of co-production of a high value chemical during biobutanol production, the Clostridium acetobutylicum riboflavin operon ribGBAH was over-expressed in C. acetobutylicum on Escherichia coli-Clostridium shuttle vector pJIR750. Constructs that either maintained the original C. acetobutylicum translational start codon or modified the start codons of ribG and ribB from TTG to ATG were designed. Riboflavin was successfully produced in both E. coli and C. acetobutylicum using these plasmids, and riboflavin could accumulate up to 27 mg/l in Clostridium culture. Furthermore, the C. acetobutylicum purine pathway was modified by over-expression of the Clostridium purF gene, which encodes the enzyme PRPP amidotransferase. The function of the plasmid pJaF bearing C. acetobutylicum purF was verified by its ability to complement an E. coli purF mutation. However, co-production of riboflavin with biobutanol by use of the purF over-expression plasmid was not improved under the experimental conditions examined. Further rational mutation of the purF gene was conducted by replacement of amino acid codons D302 V and K325Q to make it similar to the feedback-resistant enzymes of other species. However, the co-expression of ribGBAH and purFC in C. acetobutylicum also did not improve riboflavin production. By buffering the culture pH, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824(pJpGN) could accumulate more than 70 mg/l riboflavin while producing 190 mM butanol in static cultures. Riboflavin production was shown to exert no effect on solvent production at these levels.
TI  - Expression, purification and characterization of two Clostridium acetobutylicum flavodoxins: potential electron transfer partners for CYP152A2.
AB  - Two flavodoxin genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum, CacFld1 (CAC0587) and CacFld2 (CAC3417), were expressed in Escherichia coli and investigated for their ability to support activity of CYP152A2, a fatty acid hydroxylase from C. acetobutylicum. E. coli flavodoxin reductase (FdR) was used as a redox partner, since flavodoxin reductase CacFdR (CAC0196) from C. acetobutylicum could not be purified in a functional form. CacFld1 was shown to accept electrons from FdR and transfer them to CYP152A2. Since H(2)O(2) was generated by uncoupling at different stages of the reconstituted electron transfer chain, catalase was used as H(2)O(2) scavenger in order to exclude peroxygenation by CYP152A2. The reconstituted P450 system with CacFld1 and FdR oxidized myristic acid with a K(M) of 137 muM and a k(cat) of 36 min(-)(1). Furthermore, the hydroxylase activity of CYP152A2 towards myristic acid with CacFld1 was 17-fold higher than without CacFld1. Along with CYP152A2 and a physiological flavodoxin reductase, CacFld1 is therefore likely to be involved in oxygen detoxification in C. acetobutylicum. Flavodoxin CacFld2 did not accept electrons from NADPH-reduced FdR, though it cannot be excluded as a candidate redox partner for CYP152A2 in the presence of an appropriate physiological reductase.
TI  - Genetic modification of critical enzymes and involved genes in butanol biosynthesis from biomass.
AB  - Interest in biobutanol, a sustainable vehicle fuel, is increasing due to rising oil prices and concerns of surrounding climate change and the energy crisis. However, the costs of biobutanol with conventional ABE fermentation by Clostridium are higher than the cost of butanol from today's petrochemical processes. Two major problems in the economic production of biobutanol are difficulty controlling the induction of a metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis and limitations imposed by severe product inhibition. With developments in biotechnology, and the completion of genome sequencing of Clostridium, genetic modification is a viable method to improve the solvent yield and the butanol production ratio. The present article aims to highlight the latest research progress on overexpressing, inserting, knocking out, and knocking down genes of the key enzymes in the ABE fermentation pathway and other relative genes (such as genes coding for heat-shock proteins, operon, transcription, etc). Recombinant manipulations of these genes in Escherichiacoli and yeast have also been reported recently, although their butanol yields are lower than in Clostridium. Butanol production with solventogenic clostridia from various feedstocks is also evaluated in this review.
TI  - Complete stereospecific repair of a synthetic dinucleotide spore photoproduct by  spore photoproduct lyase.
AB  - Spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase), a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine superfamily of enzymes, catalyzes the repair of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine [spore photoproduct (SP)], a type of UV-induced DNA damage unique to bacterial spores. The anaerobic purification and characterization of Clostridium acetobutylicum SP lyase heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and its catalytic activity in repairing stereochemically defined synthetic dinucleotide SPs was investigated. The purified enzyme contains between 2.3 and 3.1 iron atoms per protein. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy reveals an isotropic signal centered at g = 1.99, characteristic of a [3Fe-4S](+) cluster accounting for 3-4% of the iron in the sample. Upon reduction, a nearly axial signal (g = 2.03, 1.93 and 1.92) characteristic of a [4Fe-4S](+) cluster is observed that accounts for 34-45% of total iron. Addition of S-adenosylmethionine to the reduced enzyme produces a rhombic signal (g = 2.02, 1.93, 1.82) unique to the S-adenosyl-L: -methionine complex while decreasing the overall EPR intensity. This reduced enzyme is shown to rapidly and completely repair the 5R diastereomer of a synthetic dinucleotide SP with a specific activity of 7.1 +/- 0.6 nmol min(-1) mg(-1), whereas no repair was observed for the 5S diastereomer.
TI  - Reconstructing the clostridial n-butanol metabolic pathway in Lactobacillus brevis.
AB  - A Lactobacillus brevis strain with the ability to synthesize butanol from glucose was constructed by metabolic engineering. The genes crt, bcd, etfB, etfA, and hbd, composing the bcs-operon, and the thl gene encode the enzymes of the lower part of the clostridial butanol pathway (crotonase, butyryl-CoA-dehydrogenase, two subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and thiolase) of Clostridium acetobutylicum. They were cloned into the Gram-positive/Gram-negative shuttle plasmid vector pHYc. The two resulting plasmids pHYc-thl-bcs and pHYc-bcs (respectively, with and without the clostridial thl gene) were transferred to Escherichia coli and L. brevis. The recombinant L. brevis strains were able to synthesize up to 300 mg l(-1) or 4.1 mM of butanol on a glucose-containing medium. A L. brevis strain carrying the clostridial bcs-operon has the ability to synthesize butanol with participation of its own thiolase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. The particular role of the enzymes involved in butanol production and the suitability of L. brevis as an n-butanol producer are discussed.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase  from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase (NROR), an O(2)-inducible protein, is a versatile  electron donor for scavengers of O(2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Clostridium acetobutylicum. Recombinant NROR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity; it was subsequently crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K. Preliminary crystallographic analysis revealed that the crystals belonged to space group P4(1)22 or P4(3)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 98.6, c = 88.3 A, and diffracted to 2.1 A resolution. Assuming that the crystals contained one molecule per asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient was calculated to be 2.7 A(3) Da(-1) and the solvent content to be 54.1%.
TI  - Metabolite stress and tolerance in the production of biofuels and chemicals: gene-expression-based systems analysis of butanol, butyrate, and acetate stresses in the anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Metabolite accumulation has pleiotropic, toxic, or beneficial effects on cell physiology, but such effects are not well understood at the molecular level. Cells respond and adapt to metabolite stress by mechanisms largely unexplored, especially in the context of multiple and simultaneous stresses. Solventogenic and related clostridia have an inherent advantage for production of biofuels and chemicals directly from cellulosic material and other complex carbohydrates, but issues of product/metabolite tolerance and related culture productivities remain. Using DNA microarray-based gene expression analysis, the transcriptional-stress responses of Clostridium acetobutylicum to fermentation acids acetate and butyrate and the solvent product butanol were analyzed and compared in the context of cell physiology. Ontological analysis demonstrated that stress by all three metabolites resulted in upregulation of genes related to post-translational modifications and chaperone activity, and downregulation of the translation-machinery genes. Motility genes were downregulated by acetate-stress only. The general metabolite stress included upregulation of numerous stress genes (dnaK, groES, groEL, hsp90, hsp18, clpC, and htrA), the solventogenic operon aad-ctfA-ctfB, and other solventogenic genes. Acetate stress downregulated expression of the butyryl-CoA- and butyrate-formation genes, while butyrate stress downregulated expression of acetate-formation genes. Pyrimidine-biosynthesis genes were downregulated by most stresses, but purine-biosynthesis genes were upregulated by acetate and butyrate, possibly for thiamine and histidine biosynthesis. Methionine-biosynthesis genes were upregulated by acetate stress, indicating a possibly conserved stress response mechanism also observed in Escherichia coli. Nitrogen-fixation gene expression was upregulated by acetate stress. Butyrate stress upregulated many iron-metabolism genes, riboflavin-biosynthesis genes, and several genes related to cellular repair from oxidative stress, such as perR and superoxide dismutases. Butanol stress upregulated the glycerol metabolism genes glpA and glpF. Surprisingly, metabolite stress had no apparent effect on the expression of the sporulation-cascade genes. It is argued that the list of upregulated genes in response to the three metabolite stresses includes several genes whose overexpression would likely impart tolerance, thus making the information generated in this study, a valuable source for the development of tolerant recombinant strains.
TI  - Tertiary structure and characterization of a glycoside hydrolase family 44 endoglucanase from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - A gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase family 44 (GH44) protein from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was synthesized and transformed into Escherichia coli. The previously uncharacterized protein was expressed with a C-terminal His tag and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Crystallization and X-ray diffraction to a 2.2-A resolution revealed a triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel-like structure with additional Greek key and beta-sandwich folds, similar to other GH44 crystal structures. The enzyme hydrolyzes cellotetraose and larger cellooligosaccharides, yielding an unbalanced product distribution, including some glucose. It attacks carboxymethylcellulose and xylan at approximately the same rates. Its activity on carboxymethylcellulose is much higher than that of the isolated C. acetobutylicum cellulosome. It also extensively converts lichenan to oligosaccharides of intermediate size and attacks Avicel to a limited extent. The enzyme has an optimal temperature in a 10-min assay of 55 degrees C and an optimal pH of 5.0.
TI  - Improvement of xylose utilization in Clostridium acetobutylicum via expression of the talA gene encoding transaldolase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was metabolically engineered for improved xylose utilization. The gene talA, which encodes transaldolase from Escherichia coli K-12, was cloned and overexpressed in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Compared with C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (824-WT), the transformant bearing the E. coli talA gene (824-TAL) showed improved ability on xylose utilization and solvents production using xylose as the sole carbon source. During the fermentation of xylose and glucose mixtures with three xylose/glucose ratios (approximately 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1), the rate of xylose consumption and final solvents titers of 824-TAL were all higher than those of 824-WT, despite glucose repression on xylose uptake still existing. These results suggest that the insufficiency of transaldolase in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of C. acetobutylicum is one of the bottlenecks for xylose metabolism and therefore, overexpressing the gene encoding transaldolase is able to improve xylose utilization and solvent production.
TI  - Problems with the microbial production of butanol.
AB  - With the incessant fluctuations in oil prices and increasing stress from environmental pollution, renewed attention is being paid to the microbial production of biofuels from renewable sources. As a gasoline substitute, butanol has advantages over traditional fuel ethanol in terms of energy density and hygroscopicity. A variety of cheap substrates have been successfully applied in the production of biobutanol, highlighting the commercial potential of biobutanol development. In this review, in order to better understand the process of acetone-butanol-ethanol production, traditional clostridia fermentation is discussed. Sporulation is probably induced by solvent formation, and the molecular mechanism leading to the initiation of sporulation and solventogenesis is also investigated. Different strategies are employed in the metabolic engineering of clostridia that aim to enhancing solvent production, improve selectivity for butanol production, and increase the tolerance of clostridia to solvents. However, it will be hard to make breakthroughs in the metabolic engineering of clostridia for butanol production without gaining a deeper understanding of the genetic background of clostridia and developing more efficient genetic tools for clostridia. Therefore, increasing attention has been paid to the metabolic engineering of E. coli for butanol production. The importation and expression of a non-clostridial butanol-producing pathway in E. coli is probably the most promising strategy for butanol biosynthesis. Due to the lower butanol titers in the fermentation broth, simultaneous fermentation and product removal techniques have been developed to reduce the cost of butanol recovery. Gas stripping is the best technique for butanol recovery found so far.
TI  - Construction of a synthetic YdbK-dependent pyruvate:H2 pathway in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3).
AB  - A synthetic pyruvate:H(2) pathway was constructed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by co-expression of six proteins: E. coli YdbK, Clostridium pasteurianum [4Fe-4S]-ferredoxin, and Clostridium acetobutylicum HydF, HydE, HydG, and HydA. The effect of cofactor addition and host strain on H(2) yield and fermentation product accumulation was studied, together with in vitro reconstitution of the entire pathway. The deletion of iscR and/or the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate to the medium enhanced the total and specific activity of recombinant YdbK and increased the yield of H(2) per glucose. It was concluded that the introduced pathway outcompeted other pyruvate-consuming reactions, and that the ability to compete for pyruvate at least in part was determined by total YdbK activity. The results demonstrate the successful construction of a high-yielding H(2) pathway in a microorganism that effectively does not synthesize any H(2). The additional co-expression of Bacillus subtilis AmyE enabled starch-dependent H(2) synthesis in minimal media.
TI  - Functions of the Clostridium acetobutylicium FabF and FabZ proteins in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The original anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway proposed by Goldfine and Bloch was based on in vivo labeling studies in Clostridium butyricum ATCC 6015 (now C. beijerinckii) but to date no dedicated unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme has been identified in Clostridia. C. acetobutylicium synthesizes the same species of unsaturated fatty acids as E. coli, but lacks all of the known unsaturated fatty acid synthetic genes identified in E. coli and other bacteria. A possible explanation was that two enzymes of saturated fatty acid synthesis of C. acetobutylicium, FabZ and FabF might also function in the unsaturated arm of the pathway (a FabZ homologue is known to be an unsaturated fatty acid synthetic enzyme in enterococci). RESULTS: We report that the FabF homologue located within the fatty acid biosynthetic gene cluster of C. acetobutylicium functions in synthesis of both unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. Expression of this protein in E. coli functionally replaced both the FabB and FabF proteins of the host in vivo and replaced E. coli FabB in a defined in vitro fatty acid synthesis system. In contrast the single C. acetobutylicium FabZ homologue, although able to functionally replace E. coli FabZ in vivo and in vitro, was unable to replace FabA, the key dehydratase-isomerase of E. coli unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and lacked isomerase activity in vitro. CONCLUSION: Thus, C. acetobutylicium introduces the double of unsaturated fatty acids by use of a novel and unknown enzyme.
TI  - Engineering alternative butanol production platforms in heterologous bacteria.
AB  - Alternative microbial hosts have been engineered as biocatalysts for butanol biosynthesis. The butanol synthetic pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum was first re-constructed in Escherichia coli to establish a baseline for comparison to other hosts. Whereas polycistronic expression of the pathway genes resulted in the production of 34 mg/L butanol, individual expression of pathway genes elevated titers to 200 mg/L. Improved titers were achieved by co-expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae formate dehydrogenase while overexpression of E. coli glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to elevate glycolytic flux improved titers to 580 mg/L. Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis were also explored as alternative production hosts. Polycistronic expression of butanol biosynthetic genes yielded butanol titers of 120 and 24 mg/L from P. putida and B. subtilis, respectively. Production in the obligate aerobe P. putida was dependent upon expression of bcd-etfAB. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering butanol biosynthesis in a variety of heterologous microorganisms, including those cultivated aerobically.
TI  - O2 and reactive oxygen species detoxification complex, composed of O2-responsive  NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase-flavoprotein A2-desulfoferrodoxin operon enzymes, rubperoxin, and rubredoxin, in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum, an obligate anaerobe, grows normally under continuous-O(2)-flow culture conditions, where the cells consume O(2) proficiently. An O(2)-responsive NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase operon composed of three genes (nror, fprA2, and dsr), encoding NROR, functionally uncharacterized flavoprotein A2 (FprA2), and the predicted superoxide reductase desulfoferrodoxin (Dsr), has been proposed to participate in defense against O(2) stress. To functionally characterize these proteins, native NROR from C. acetobutylicum, recombinant NROR (rNROR), FprA2, Dsr, and rubredoxin (Rd) expressed in Escherichia coli were purified. Purified native NROR and rNROR both exhibited weak H(2)O(2)-forming NADH oxidase activity that was slightly activated by Rd. A mixture of NROR, Rd, and FprA2 functions as an efficient H(2)O-forming NADH oxidase with a high affinity for O(2) (the K(m) for O(2) is 2.9 +/- 0.4 microM). A mixture of NROR, Rd, and Dsr functions as an NADH-dependent O(2)(-) reductase. A mixture of NROR, Rd, and rubperoxin (Rpr, a rubrerythrin homologue) functions as an inefficient H(2)O-forming NADH oxidase but an efficient NADH peroxidase with a low affinity for O(2) and a high affinity for H(2)O(2) (the K(m)s for O(2) and H(2)O(2) are 303 +/- 39 microM and <or=1 microM, respectively). A gene encoding Rd is dicistronically transcribed with a gene encoding a glutaredoxin (Gd) homologue, and the expression levels of the genes encoding Gd and Rd were highly upregulated upon exposure to O(2). Therefore, nror operon enzymes, together with Rpr, efficiently function to scavenge O(2), O(2)(-), and H(2)O(2) by using an O(2)-responsive rubredoxin as a common electron carrier protein.
TI  - Characterization of the posttranscriptional modifications in Legionella pneumophila small-subunit ribosomal RNA.
AB  - It is generally accepted that posttranscriptional modifications in RNA play a role in the fine-tuning of RNA function and the maintenance of RNA structure. This article describes the characterization of the posttranscriptional modifications in Legionella pneumophila 16S rRNA by mass spectrometry and reverse transcriptase assays. Eight modified nucleotides were identified and mapped in the 16S rRNA sequence. Situation of these data in relation to general 16S rRNA modification patterns shows that L. pneumophila is relatively less modified, and that the majority of the L. pneumophila 16S rRNA modifications are conserved among the bacteria characterized so far (Escherichia coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Thermus thermophilus, and Thermotoga maritima).
TI  - Reductive dioxygen scavenging by flavo-diiron proteins of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Two flavo-diiron proteins (FDPs), FprA1 and FprA2, are up-regulated when the strictly anaerobic solvent producer, Clostridium acetobutylicum, is exposed to dioxygen. These two FDPs were purified following heterologous overexpression in Escherichia coli as N-terminal Strep-tag fusion proteins. The recombinant FprA1 and FprA2 were found to be homodimeric and homotetrameric, respectively, and both FDPs functioned as terminal components of NADH oxidases (NADH:O(2) oxidoreductases) when using C. acetobutylicum NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase (NROR) and rubredoxin (Rd) as electron transport intermediaries. Both FDPs catalyzed the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water with similar specific activities. The results are consistent with these FDPs functioning as efficient scavengers of intracellular dioxygen under aerobic or microoxic growth conditions.
TI  - Replacing Escherichia coli NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) with a NADP-dependent enzyme from Clostridium acetobutylicum facilitates NADPH dependent pathways.
AB  - Reactions requiring reducing equivalents, NAD(P)H, are of enormous importance for the synthesis of industrially valuable compounds such as carotenoids, polymers, antibiotics and chiral alcohols among others. The use of whole-cell biocatalysis can reduce process cost by acting as catalyst and cofactor regenerator at the same time; however, product yields might be limited by cofactor availability within the cell. Thus, our study focussed on the genetic manipulation of a whole-cell system by modifying metabolic pathways and enzymes to improve the overall production process. In the present work, we genetically engineered an Escherichia coli strain to increase NADPH availability to improve the productivity of products that require NADPH in its biosynthesis. The approach involved an alteration of the glycolysis step where glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) is oxidized to 1,3 bisphophoglycerate (1,3-BPG). This reaction is catalyzed by NAD-dependent endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) encoded by the gapA gene. We constructed a recombinant E. coli strain by replacing the native NAD-dependent gapA gene with a NADP-dependent GAPDH from Clostridium acetobutylicum, encoded by the gene gapC. The beauty of this approach is that the recombinant E. coli strain produces 2 mol of NADPH, instead of NADH, per mole of glucose consumed. Metabolic flux analysis showed that the flux through the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, one of the main pathways that produce NADPH, was reduced significantly in the recombinant strain when compared to that of the parent strain. The effectiveness of the NADPH enhancing system was tested using the production of lycopene and epsilon-caprolactone as model systems using two different background strains. The recombinant strains, with increased NADPH availability, consistently showed significant higher productivity than the parent strains.
TI  - In situ product recovery of n-butanol using polymeric resins.
AB  - Polymeric resins with high n-butanol adsorption affinities were identified from a candidate pool of commercially available materials representing a wide array of physical and chemical properties. Resin hydrophobicity, which was dictated by the chemical structure of its constituent monomer units, most greatly influenced the resin-aqueous equilibrium partitioning of n-butanol whereas ionic functionalization appeared to have no effect. In general, those materials derived from poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) possessed the greatest n-butanol affinity, while the adsorption potential of these resins was limited by their specific surface area. Resins were tested for their ability to serve as effective in situ product recovery (ISPR) devices in the n-butanol fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. In small-scale batch fermentations, the addition of 0.05 kg/L Dowex Optipore SD-2 facilitated achievement of effective n-butanol titers as high as 2.22% (w/v), well above the inhibitory threshold of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, and nearly twice that of traditional, single-phase fermentations. Retrieval of n-butanol from resins via thermal treatment was demonstrated with high efficiency and predicted to be economically favorable. Due to its modular nature, the proposed ISPR design exhibits strong potential for compatibility with future n-butanol fermentation efforts.
TI  - The two-component system PhoPR of Clostridium acetobutylicum is involved in phosphate-dependent gene regulation.
AB  - The phoPR gene locus of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 comprises two genes,  phoP and phoR. Deduced proteins are predicted to represent a response regulator and sensor kinase of a phosphate-dependent two-component regulatory system. We analyzed the expression patterns of phoPR in P(i)-limited chemostat cultures and in response to P(i) pulses. A basic transcription level under high-phosphate conditions was shown, and a significant increase in mRNA transcript levels was found when external P(i) concentrations dropped below 0.3 mM. In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments, a 2.5-fold increase in PhoP was observed under P(i)-limiting growth conditions compared to growth with an excess of P(i). At least three different transcription start points for phoP were determined by primer extension analyses. Proteins PhoP and an N-terminally truncated *PhoR were individually expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and purified. Autophosphorylation of *PhoR and phosphorylation of PhoP were shown in vitro. Electromobility shift assays proved that there was a specific binding of PhoP to the promoter region of the phosphate-regulated pst operon of C. acetobutylicum.
TI  - Clostridium acetobutylicum 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg) differs from eukaryotic Oggs with respect to opposite base discrimination.
AB  - During repair of damaged DNA, the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is removed  by 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (Ogg) in eukaryotes and most archaea, whereas in most bacteria it is removed by formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). We report the first characterization of a bacterial Ogg, Clostridium acetobutylicum Ogg (CacOgg). Like human OGG1 and Escherichia coli Fpg (EcoFpg), CacOgg excised 8-oxoguanine. However, unlike hOGG1 and EcoFpg, CacOgg showed little preference for the base opposite the damage during base excision and removed 8-oxoguanine from single-stranded DNA. Thus, our results showed unambiguous qualitative functional differences in vitro between CacOgg and both hOGG1 and EcoFpg. CacOgg differs in sequence from the eukaryotic enzymes at two sequence positions, M132 and F179, which align with amino acids (R154 and Y203) in human OGG1 (hOGG1) found to be involved in opposite base interaction. To address the sequence basis for functional differences with respect to opposite base interactions, we prepared three CacOgg variants, M132R, F179Y, and M132R/F179Y. All three variants showed a substantial increase in specificity for 8-oxoG.C relative to 8-oxoG.A. While we were unable to definitively associate these qualitative functional differences with differences in selective pressure between eukaryotes, Clostridia, and other bacteria, our results are consistent with the idea that evolution of Ogg function is based on kinetic control of repair.
TI  - HydF as a scaffold protein in [FeFe] hydrogenase H-cluster biosynthesis.
AB  - In an effort to determine the specific protein component(s) responsible for in vitro activation of the [FeFe] hydrogenase (HydA), the individual maturation proteins HydE, HydF, and HydG from Clostridium acetobutylicum were purified from heterologous expressions in Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that HydF isolated from a strain expressing all three maturation proteins is sufficient to confer hydrogenase activity to purified inactive heterologously expressed HydA (expressed in the absence of HydE, HydF, and HydG). These results represent the first in vitro maturation of [FeFe] hydrogenase with purified proteins, and suggest that HydF functions as a scaffold upon which an H-cluster intermediate is synthesized.
TI  - Biosynthesis of enantiopure (S)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - A biosynthetic pathway for the production of (S)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (S3HB) from glucose was established in recombinant Escherichia coli by introducing the beta-ketothiolase gene from Ralstonia eutropha H16, the (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene from R. eutropha H16, or Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase gene from Bacillus cereus ATCC14579. Artificial operon consisting of these genes was constructed and was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus under T7 promoter by isopropyl beta-D: -thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction. Recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus expressing the beta-ketothiolase gene, the (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase gene could synthesize enantiomerically pure S3HB to the concentration of 0.61 g l(-1) from 20 g l(-1) of glucose in Luria-Bertani medium. Fed-batch cultures of recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus were carried out to achieve higher titer of S3HB with varying induction time and glucose concentration during fermentation. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG when cell concentration reached 10 and 20 g l(-1) (OD(600) = 30 and 60), respectively. When protein expression was induced at 60 of OD(600) and glucose was fed to the concentration of 15 g l(-1), 10.3 g l(-1) of S3HB was obtained in 38 h with the S3HB productivity of 0.21 g l(-1)h(-1). Lowering glucose concentration to 5 g l(-1) and induction of protein expression at 30 of OD(600) significantly reduced final S3HB concentration to 3.7 g l(-1), which also resulted in the decrease of the S3HB productivity to 0.05 g l(-1)h(-1).
TI  - Characterization of two 2[4Fe4S] ferredoxins from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - In vivo hydrogen production in Clostridium acetobutylicum involves electron transfer between ferredoxin and [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Five C. acetobutylicum open reading frames were annotated as coding for putative ferredoxins. We focused our biophysical and biochemical investigations on CAC0303 and CAC3527, which possess the sequence signature and length of classical 2[4Fe4S] clostridial ferredoxins but differ significantly in theoretical pI. After cloning, heterologous expression in E. coli followed by in vitro Fe-S incorporation and purification, CAC0303 was shown to have a regular electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal for a classical 2[4Fe4S] clostridial ferredoxin, while CAC3527 displayed an unusual EPR signal and a quite low reduction potential. Both ferredoxins were reduced in vitro by C. acetobutylicum [FeFe]-hydrogenase, but the CAC3527 reduction rate was 10-fold lower than that of CAC0303. These results are consistent with the efficiency of intermolecular electron transfer being dictated by the redox thermodynamics, the contribution of the ferredoxin global charge being only minor. The physiological function of CAC3527 is discussed.
TI  - Expression of Clostridium acetobutylicum butanol synthetic genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A recombinant butanol pathway composed of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 genes, thiL, hbd, crt, bcd-etfB-etfA, and adhe1 (or adhe) coding for acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (THL), beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBD), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (CRT), butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD), butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (BYDH), and butanol dehydrogenase (BDH), under the tac promoter control was constructed and was introduced into Escherichia coli. The functional expression of these six enzymes was proved by demonstrating the corresponding enzyme activities using spectrophotometric, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography analyses. The BCD activity, which was not detected in E. coli previously, was shown in the present study by performing the procedure from cell extract preparation to activity measurement under anaerobic condition. Moreover, the etfA and etfB co-expression was found to be essential for the BCD activity. In the case of BYDH activity, the adhe gene product was shown to have higher specificity towards butyryl-CoA compared to the adhe1 product. Butanol production from glucose was achieved by the highly concentrated cells of the butanologenic E. coli strains, BUT1 with adhe1 and BUT2 with adhe, under anaerobic condition, and the BUT1 and BUT2 strains were shown to produce 4 and 16-mM butanol with 6- and 1-mM butyrate as a byproduct, respectively. This study reports the novel butanol production by an aerobically pregrown microorganism possessing the genes of a strict anaerobe, Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Production of isopropanol by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - A genetically engineered strain of Escherichia coli JM109 harboring the isopropanol-producing pathway consisting of five genes encoding four enzymes, thiolase, coenzyme A (CoA) transferase, acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, and primary-secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from C. beijerinckii NRRL B593, produced up to 227 mM of isopropanol from glucose under aerobic fed-batch culture conditions. Acetate production by the engineered strain was approximately one sixth that produced by a control E. coli strain bearing an expression vector without the clostridial genes. These results demonstrate a functional isopropanol-producing pathway in E. coli and consequently carbon flux from acetyl-CoA directed to isopropanol instead of acetate. This is the first report on isopropanol production by genetically engineered microorganism under aerobic culture conditions.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for 1-butanol production.
AB  - Compared to ethanol, butanol offers many advantages as a substitute for gasoline  because of higher energy content and higher hydrophobicity. Typically, 1-butanol is produced by Clostridium in a mixed-product fermentation. To facilitate strain improvement for specificity and productivity, we engineered a synthetic pathway in Escherichia coli and demonstrated the production of 1-butanol from this non-native user-friendly host. Alternative genes and competing pathway deletions were evaluated for 1-butanol production. Results show promise for using E. coli for 1-butanol production.
TI  - Engineered synthetic pathway for isopropanol production in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A synthetic pathway was engineered in Escherichia coli to produce isopropanol by  expressing various combinations of genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, E. coli K-12 MG1655, Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B593, and Thermoanaerobacter brockii HTD4. The strain with the combination of C. acetobutylicum thl (acetyl-coenzyme A [CoA] acetyltransferase), E. coli atoAD (acetoacetyl-CoA transferase), C. acetobutylicum adc (acetoacetate decarboxylase), and C. beijerinckii adh (secondary alcohol dehydrogenase) achieved the highest titer. This strain produced 81.6 mM isopropanol in shake flasks with a yield of 43.5% (mol/mol) in the production phase. To our knowledge, this work is the first to produce isopropanol in E. coli, and the titer exceeded that from the native producers.
TI  - Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum: a new alpha-fatty  acid hydroxylase.
AB  - Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from the anaerobic microorganism Clostridium acetobutylicum (CYP152A2) has been produced in Escherichia coli. CYP152A2 was shown to bind a broad range of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and corresponding methyl esters and demonstrated a high peroxygenase activity of up to 200min(-1) with myristic acid. Although a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide of 200microM was necessary for high activities of the enzyme, it led to a fast enzyme inactivation within 2-4min. This might reflect the natural function of CYP152A2 as a rapid hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzyme. In two different reconstituted systems with NADPH, CYP152A2 was able to convert 10 times more substrate, if provided with flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase from E. coli and even 30-40 times more substrate with the CYP102A1-reductase from Bacillus megaterium. According to the clear preference for hydroxylation at alpha-position, CYP152A2 can be referred to as fatty acid alpha-hydroxylase.
TI  - Complete activity profile of Clostridium acetobutylicum [FeFe]-hydrogenase and kinetic parameters for endogenous redox partners.
AB  - In Clostridium acetobutylicum, [FeFe]-hydrogenase is involved in hydrogen production in vivo by transferring electrons from physiological electron donors, ferredoxin and flavodoxin, to protons. In this report, by modifications of the purification procedure, the specific activity of the enzyme has been improved and its complete catalytic profile in hydrogen evolution, hydrogen uptake, proton/deuterium exchange and para-H2/ortho-H2 conversion has been determined. The major ferredoxin expressed in the solvent-producing C. acetobutylicum cells was purified and identified as encoded by ORF CAC0303. Clostridium acetobutylicum recombinant holoflavodoxin CAC0587 was also purified. The kinetic parameters of C. acetobutylicum [FeFe]-hydrogenase for both physiological partners, ferredoxin CAC0303 and flavodoxin CAC0587, are reported for hydrogen uptake and hydrogen evolution activities.
TI  - Post-transcriptional modification mapping in the Clostridium acetobutylicum 16S rRNA by mass spectrometry and reverse transcriptase assays.
AB  - Post-transcriptional modifications in ribosomal RNA are believed to fine-tune the RNA functions. The present study describes the characterization of the post-transcriptional modifications in Clostridium acetobutylicum 16S rRNA, using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and reverse transcriptase assays. The combination of these techniques allowed the identification of eleven modified nucleosides, which were mapped onto the rRNA sequence. The C. acetobutylicum modification map is similar to that of Escherichia coli, with the majority of the modifications near functionally important sites in the rRNA. Although, in general, the number of modifications in rRNA is smaller than in tRNA, the conservation of the modification sites seems to indicate that the post-transcriptional modifications in 16S rRNA provide a necessary prerequisite for the ribosomal function.
TI  - Heat-shock protein HspA mimics the function of phasins sensu stricto in recombinant strains of Escherichia coli accumulating polythioesters or polyhydroxyalkanoates.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAs) are synthesized by unspecific PHA synthases and  deposited as energy and carbon storage granules in the cytoplasm of many prokaryotes. The number and size of the granules depend on the presence of phasins which are amphiphilic structural proteins occurring at the granule surface. Recently, it was shown that polythioesters (PTEs) are also synthesized by PHA synthases. To increase the yield of these polymers, the role of recombinant phasins was analysed in an artificial PHA-producing Escherichia coli strain. Overexpressed PhaP1 from Ralstonia eutropha H16 affected poly(3-mercaptopropionate) [poly(3MP)] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3HB)] accumulation in recombinant E. coli, which expressed the non-natural BPEC pathway consisting of butyrate kinase and phosphotransbutyrylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum and PHA synthase from Thiococcus pfennigii. For this, BPEC-carrying E. coli with and without phaP1 was cultivated in presence of glucose as carbon source for growth plus 3-mercaptopropionate or 3-hydroxybutyrate as precursor substrates for poly(3MP) or poly(3HB) biosynthesis, respectively. In the presence of PhaP1, the recombinant E. coli produced about 50 or 68 % more poly(3MP) or poly(3HB), respectively. Therefore, coexpression of PhaP1 alongside the BPEC pathway is important for optimizing strains towards enhanced PHA or PTE production. Furthermore, in the absence of PhaP1, large amounts of the 16 kDa heat-shock protein HspA were synthesized and bound to the granule surface. Unusual small granules occurred in the cells of the recombinant E. coli strains. The diameter of the poly(3MP) granules was only 55+/-12 nm or 105+/-12 nm, and of the poly(3HB) granules only 56+/-10 or 110+/-22 nm in the presence or absence of PhaP1, respectively. This explains why no single granules capable of accumulating PHAs or PTEs occurred in the recombinant E. coli, unlike in PhaP1-negative mutants of R. eutropha. Obviously, HspA mimics the phasin, thereby preventing coalescence of granules into one single granule. However, the effect of PhaP1 on granule size and on amounts of accumulated polymers was more severe than that of HspA.
TI  - Novel substrate specificity of glutathione synthesis enzymes from Streptococcus agalactiae and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS) in living organisms. Recently, bifunctional fusion protein, termed gamma-GCS-GS catalyzing both gamma-GCS and GS reactions from gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae, has been reported. We revealed that in the gamma-GCS activity, S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS had different substrate specificities from those of Escherichia coli gamma-GCS. Furthermore, S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-Glu-X(aa)-Gly, from free three amino acids. In Clostridium acetobutylicum, the genes encoding gamma-GCS and putative GS were found to be immediately adjacent by BLAST search, and had amino acid sequence homology with S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS, respectively. We confirmed that the proteins expressed from each gene showed gamma-GCS and GS activity, respectively. C. acetobutylicum GS had broad substrate specificities and synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-Glu-Cys-X(aa). Whereas the substrate specificities of gamma-GCS domain protein and GS domain protein of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS were the same as those of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS.
TI  - Characterization of a novel ferredoxin with N-terminal extension from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - A gene (CAC2657) encoding a ferredoxin (EFR1) from the strictly anaerobic soil bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ferredoxin gene encodes a polypeptide of 27 kDa that incorporates 2[4Fe-4S] clusters. An extended N-terminal region of 187 amino acid (aa) residues precedes ferredoxin domain. The EFR1 expressed in E. coli is a trimeric protein. The iron and sulfur content of the reconstituted protein agrees with that expected of a trimeric form of the protein. The ferredoxin domain of EFR1 is closely related to ferredoxin of C. pasteurianum; and can be fitted to the X-ray crystal structure with a root mean square deviation of 0.62 As for the Calpha atoms of the generated 3D simulation model. In cultures of C. acetobutylicum the efr1 gene shows higher relative expression on induction with Trinitrotoluene (TNT) compared to that from uninduced control cultures.
TI  - Transcription of the pst operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum is dependent on phosphate concentration and pH.
AB  - The pst operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 comprises five genes, pstS, pstC, pstA, pstB, and phoU, and shows a gene architecture identical to that of Escherichia coli. Deduced proteins are predicted to represent a high-affinity phosphate-specific ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transport system (Pst) and a protein homologous to PhoU, a negative phosphate regulon regulator. We analyzed the expression patterns of the pst operon in P(i)-limited chemostat cultures during acid production at pH 5.8 or solvent production at pH 4.5 and in response to P(i) pulses. Specific mRNA transcripts were found only when external P(i) concentrations had dropped below 0.2 mM. Two specific transcripts were detected, a 4.7-kb polycistronic mRNA spanning the whole operon and a quantitatively dominating 1.2-kb mRNA representing the first gene, pstS. The mRNA levels clearly differed depending on the external pH. The amounts of the full-length mRNA detected were about two times higher at pH 5.8 than at pH 4.5. The level of pstS mRNA increased by a factor of at least 8 at pH 5.8 compared to pH 4.5 results. Primer extension experiments revealed only one putative transcription start point 80 nucleotides upstream of pstS. Thus, additional regulatory sites are proposed in the promoter region, integrating two different extracellular signals, namely, depletion of inorganic phosphate and the pH of the environment. After phosphate pulses were applied to a phosphate-limited chemostat we observed faster phosphate consumption at pH 5.8 than at pH 4.5, although higher optical densities were recorded at pH 4.5.
TI  - Studies on inhibition of transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene catalyzed by Fe-only hydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The major enzyme in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 leading to transformation of TNT has been reported to be the Fe-only hydrogenase. In this study, we examine the effect of inhibitors of hydrogenase on TNT reduction by Clostridial extracts. These experiments further demonstrate the major role of hydrogenase in TNT transformation. The C. acetobutylicum hydrogenase is closely related to that of C. pasteurianum; and can be fitted to the X-ray crystal structure with a root mean square deviation of 1.18 angstroms for the Calpha atoms of the generated 3D simulation model. The Hyd1, Hyd2, and Hyd3 antibodies generated against hydrogenase reacted with both the hydrogenase in cell extracts and with C. acetobutylicum hydrogenase expressed in Escherichia coli. Inhibition studies using antibodies against Fe-only hydrogenase from C. acetobutylicum indicated that the transformation of TNT by crude cell extracts was completely inhibited by Hyd2 antibody (to amino acid 415-428) whereas antibodies Hyd1 (to residues 1-16) and Hyd3 (to amino acid 424-448) inhibited less effectively. The TNT transforming activity of the cell extract was retained when Hyd2 antibody pretreated with purified but enzymatically inactive recombinant hydrogenase was added to the extract. Addition of the transition metal Cu2+ to extracts completely inhibited the transformation of TNT suggesting the destruction of [4Fe-4S] centers which are essential for transfer of electrons from the H2-activating site to TNT. Growth of C. acetobutylicum was also inhibited by 0.5 mM Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions. The triazine dye, procion red and the nitroimidazole drug, metronidazole inhibit TNT reduction. The inhibition studies using antibodies, procion red, metronidazole, and transition metals suggest that different portions of hydrogenase are required for effective TNT reduction.
TI  - Functional studies of [FeFe] hydrogenase maturation in an Escherichia coli biosynthetic system.
AB  - Maturation of [FeFe] hydrogenases requires the biosynthesis and insertion of the  catalytic iron-sulfur cluster, the H cluster. Two radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins proposed to function in H cluster biosynthesis, HydEF and HydG, were recently identified in the hydEF-1 mutant of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (M. C. Posewitz, P. W. King, S. L. Smolinski, L. Zhang, M. Seibert, and M. L. Ghirardi, J. Biol. Chem. 279:25711-25720, 2004). Previous efforts to study [FeFe] hydrogenase maturation in Escherichia coli by coexpression of C. reinhardtii HydEF and HydG and the HydA1 [FeFe] hydrogenase were hindered by instability of the hydEF and hydG expression clones. A more stable [FeFe] hydrogenase expression system has been achieved in E. coli by cloning and coexpression of hydE, hydF, and hydG from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Coexpression of the C. acetobutylicum maturation proteins with various algal and bacterial [FeFe] hydrogenases in E. coli resulted in purified enzymes with specific activities that were similar to those of the enzymes purified from native sources. In the case of structurally complex [FeFe] hydrogenases, maturation of the catalytic sites could occur in the absence of an accessory iron-sulfur cluster domain. Initial investigations of the structure and function of the maturation proteins HydE, HydF, and HydG showed that the highly conserved radical-SAM domains of both HydE and HydG and the GTPase domain of HydF were essential for achieving biosynthesis of active [FeFe] hydrogenases. Together, these results demonstrate that the catalytic domain and a functionally complete set of Hyd maturation proteins are fundamental to achieving biosynthesis of catalytic [FeFe] hydrogenases.
TI  - A wide host-range metagenomic library from a waste water treatment plant yields a novel alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase.
AB  - Using DNA obtained from the metagenome of an anaerobic digestor in a waste water  treatment plant, we constructed a gene library cloned in the wide host-range cosmid pLAFR3. One cosmid enabled Rhizobium leguminosarum to grow on ethanol as sole carbon and energy source, this being due to the presence of a gene, termed adhEMeta. The AdhEMeta protein most closely resembles the AdhE alcohol dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum, where it catalyses the formation of ethanol and butanol in a two-step reductive process. However, cloned adhEMeta did not confer ethanol utilization ability to Escherichia coli or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even though it was transcribed in both these hosts. Further, cell-free extracts of E. coli and R. leguminosarum containing cloned adhEMeta had butanol and ethanol dehydrogenase activities when assayed in vitro. In contrast to the well-studied AdhE proteins of C. acetobutylicum and E. coli, the enzyme specified by adhEMeta is not inactivated by oxygen and it enables alcohol to be catabolized. Cloned adhEMeta did, however, confer one phenotype to E. coli. AdhE- mutants of E. coli fail to ferment glucose and introduction of adhEMeta restored the growth of such mutants when grown under fermentative conditions. These observations show that the use of wide host-range vectors enhances the efficacy with which metagenomic libraries can be screened for genes that confer novel functions.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 with some plasmids.
AB  - Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 was transformed with several shuttle plasmids constructed for Clostridium acetobutylicum-Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens-E. coli by electroporation. The Clostridium stercorarium xylanase gene xyn10B was successfully expressed in C. paraputrificum M-21 and the expressed protein did not suffer from proteolysis by host protease(s). This system will provide us with a genetic tool for genetic and metabolic engineering of this bacterium.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of trinitrotoluene transforming oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The genes that encode oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases from Clostridium acetobutylicum possessing 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) transformation activity were cloned, sequenced and characterized. The gene products NitA (MW 31 kDa) and NitB (MW 23 kDa) were purified to homogeneity. The NitA and NitB are oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases comprised of a single nitroreductase domain. NitA and NitB enzymes show spectral characteristics similar to flavoproteins. The biochemical characteristics of NitA and NitB are highly similar to those of NfsA, the major nitroreductase from E. coli. NitA exhibited broad specificity similar to that of E. coli NfsA and displayed no flavin reductase activity. NitB showed broad substrate specificity toward nitrocompounds in a pattern similar to NfsA and NfsB of Escherichia coli. NitB has high sequence similarity to NAD(P)H nitroreductase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. NitA could utilize only NADH as an electron donor, whereas NitB utilized both NADH and NADPH as electron donors with a preference for NADH. The activity of both nitroreductases was high toward 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) as a substrate. Both the nitroreductases were inhibited by dicoumarol and salicyl hydroxamate. The nitroreductases showed higher relative expression on induction with TNT, nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin compared to the uninduced control.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Clostridium acetobutylicum for the industrial production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol.
AB  - Clostridium butyricum is to our knowledge the best natural 1,3-propanediol producer from glycerol and the only microorganism identified so far to use a coenzyme B12-independent glycerol dehydratase. However, to develop an economical process of 1,3-propanediol production, it would be necessary to improve the strain by a metabolic engineering approach. Unfortunately, no genetic tools are currently available for C. butyricum and all our efforts to develop them have been so far unsuccessful. To obtain a better "vitamin B12-free" biological process, we developed a metabolic engineering strategy with Clostridium acetobutylicum. The 1,3-propanediol pathway from C. butyricum was introduced on a plasmid in several mutants of C. acetobutylicum altered in product formation. The DG1(pSPD5) recombinant strain was the most efficient strain and was further characterized from a physiological and biotechnological point of view. Chemostat cultures of this strain grown on glucose alone produced only acids (acetate, butyrate and lactate) and a high level of hydrogen. In contrast, when glycerol was metabolized in chemostat culture, 1,3-propanediol became the major product, the specific rate of acid formation decreased and a very low level of hydrogen was observed. In a fed-batch culture, the DG1(pSPD5) strain was able to produce 1,3-propanediol at a higher concentration (1104 mM) and productivity than the natural producer C. butyricum VPI 3266. Furthermore, this strain was also successfully used for very long term continuous production of 1,3-propanediol at high volumetric productivity (3 g L-1 h-1) and titer (788 mM).
TI  - Genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  - beta-Glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from Ruminococcus gnavus E1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-Glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp DNA fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from R. gnavus E1 was determined. Five ORFs were detected on this fragment: three complete ORFs (ORF2, gus and ORF3) and two partial ORFs (ORF4 and ORF5). The products of ORF2 and ORF3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), such as Escherichia coli BglC, Bacillus subtilis BglP and Bacillus halodurans PTS Enzyme II. The product of ORF5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bglA). The gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of Lactobacillus gasseri (69%), E. coli (61%), Clostridium perfringens (59%) and Staphylococcus aureus (58%). By complementing an E. coli strain in which the uidA gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the R. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. Moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes ORF2, ORF3 and ORF5.
TI  - Biosynthesis of poly (3-mercaptopropionate) and poly (3-mercaptopropionate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) with recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Polythioesters newly emerged as a type of novel polymer and they have showed great potential for application in industries. In this study, genes of butyrate kinase (buk) and phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb) from Clostridium acetobutylicum, and poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthase gene from Thiocapsa pfennigii were used for construction of a metabolic pathway to synthesize the polythioesters. When 3-mercaptopropionate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were fed, poly (3-mercaptopropoinate) [poly (3MP)] and poly(3-mercaptopropionate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3MP-co-3HB)] were synthesized by recombinant Escherichia coli JM109 (pBPP1) harboring the constructed metabolic pathway. Results indicated clearly that all these genes are necessary for the synthesis of poly(3MP) and poly(3MP-co-3HB).
TI  - Characterization of thermostable Xyn10A enzyme from mesophilic Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - A thermostable xylanase gene, xyn10A (CAP0053), was cloned from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The nucleotide sequence of the C. acetobutylicum xyn10A gene encoded a 318-amino-acid, single-domain, family 10 xylanase, Xyn10A, with a molecular mass of 34 kDa. Xyn10A exhibited extremely high (92%) amino acid sequence identity with Xyn10B (CAP0116) of this strain and had 42% and 32% identity with the catalytic domains of Rhodothermus marinus xylanase I and Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase I, respectively. Xyn10A enzyme was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli and was highly active toward oat-spelt and Birchwood xylan and slightly active toward carboxymethyl cellulose, arabinogalactouronic acid, and various p-nitrophenyl monosaccharides. Xyn10A hydrolyzed xylan and xylooligosaccharides larger than xylobiose to produce xylose. This enzyme was optimally active at 60 degrees C and had an optimum pH of 5.0. This is one of a number of related activities encoded on the large plasmid in this strain.
TI  - Substrate-induced production and secretion of cellulases by Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is a solventogenic bacterium that grows heterotrophically on a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, cellobiose, xylose, and lichenan, a linear polymer of beta-1,3- and beta-1,4-linked beta-D-glucose units. C. acetobutylicum does not degrade cellulose, although its genome sequence contains several cellulase-encoding genes and a complete cellulosome cluster of cellulosome genes. In the present study, we demonstrate that a low but significant level of induction of cellulase activity occurs during growth on xylose or lichenan. The celF gene, located in the cellulosome-like gene cluster and coding for a unique cellulase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 48, was cloned in Escherichia coli, and antibodies were raised against the overproduced CelF protein. A Western blot analysis suggested a possible catabolite repression by glucose or cellobiose and an up-regulation by lichenan or xylose of the extracellular production of CelF by C. acetobutylicum. Possible reasons for the apparent inability of C. acetobutylicum to degrade cellulose are discussed.
TI  - Thermostable xylanase10B from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824.
AB  - The Clostridium acetobutylicum xylanase gene xyn10B (CAP0116) was cloned from the type strain ATCC 824, whose genome was recently sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of C. acetobutylicum xyn10B encodes a 318-amino acid protein. Xyn10B consists of a single catalytic domain that belongs to family 10 of glycosyl hydrolases. The enzyme was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli. The Xyn10B enzyme was highly active toward birchwood xylan, oat-spelt xylan, and moderately active toward avicel, carboxymethyl cellulose, polygalacturonic acid, lichenan, laminarin, barley-beta-glucan and various p-nitrophenyl monosaccharides. Xyn10B hydrolyzed xylan and xylooligosaccharides to produce xylobiose and xylotriose. The pH optimum of Xyn10B was 5.0, and the optimal temperature was 70 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at 60 degrees C at pH 5.0-6.5 for 1 h without substrate. This is one of a number of xylan-related activities encoded on the large plasmid in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
TI  - Analysis of orthologous hrcA genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The hrcA gene codes for a transcriptional repressor protein interacting with the  CIRCE operator thereby reducing expression of the groE operon of more than 120 bacterial species. At least in Bacillus subtilis, the activity of the HrcA protein is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system. We amplified the hrcA gene from five different bacterial species and analyzed its activity in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. While those from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Staphylococcus aureus turned out to be active, those of Helicobacter pylori, Lactococcus lactis and Thermotoga maritima were inactive in E. coli, but that of T. maritima turned out to repress expression of the reporter gene in B. subtilis. All these results strongly suggest to us a specific recognition of HrcA by the GroE chaperonin system.
TI  - Transcriptional organization of the Clostridium acetobutylicum genome.
AB  - Prokaryotic genes are frequently organized in multicistronic operons (or transcriptional units, TUs), and usually the regulatory motifs for the whole TU are located upstream of the first TU gene. Although the number of sequenced genomes has increased dramatically, experimental information on TU organization is extremely limited. Even for organisms as extensively studied as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, TU annotation is far from complete. It therefore becomes imperative to rely on computational approaches to complement experimental information. Here we present a TU map for the obligate anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. This map is largely based on the distance between pairs of consecutive genes but enhanced and refined by predictions of several types of promoters (sigmaA, sigmaE and sigmaF/G) and rho-independent terminator structures. Based on the set of known C.acetobutylicum TUs, the presented TU map offers an 88% prediction accuracy.
TI  - Sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the Clostridium stercorarium beta-xylosidase Xyl43B in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Clostridium stercorarium F-9 xyl43B gene encoding the beta-xylosidase Xyl43B  consists of an open reading frame of 1,491 nucleotides that encodes a putative protein, classified in family 43, of 497 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 56,355. The deduced amino acid sequence of Xyl43B has sequence similarity with beta-xylosidases from Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron (57% sequence identity), Prevotella ruminicola (45%), Streptomyces coelicolor (40%), and Clostridium acetobutylicum (36%), all of which have been classified in family 43 of the glycoside hydrolases. Xyl43B was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli and characterized. The optimum pH of the purified enzyme was 3.5 and it was stable over pH from 3.0 to 8.0. Its optimum temperature was 80 degrees C and it showed thermostability in the temperature range from 50 to 70 degrees C. Xyl43B had a K(m) of 6.2 mM and a V(max) of 15 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside.
TI  - Analysis of the elements of catabolite repression in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The PTSH gene, encoding the phosphotransferase protein HPr, from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was identified from the genome sequence, cloned and shown to complement a PTSH mutant of Escherichia coli. The deduced protein sequence shares significant homology with HPr proteins from other low-GC gram-positive bacteria, although the highly conserved sequence surrounding the Ser-46 phosphorylation site is not well preserved in the clostridial protein. Nevertheless, the HPr was phosphorylated in an ATP-dependent manner in cell-free extracts of C. Acetobutylicum. Furthermore, purified His-tagged HPr from Bacillus Subtilis was also a substrate for the clostridial HPr kinase/phosphorylase. This phosphorylation reaction is a key step in the mechanism of carbon catabolite repression proposed to operate in B. Subtilis and other low-GC gram-positive bacteria. Putative genes encoding the HPr kinase/phosphorylase and the other element of this model, namely the catabolite control protein CcpA, were identified from the C. Acetobutylicum genome sequence, suggesting that a similar mechanism of carbon catabolite repression may operate in this industrially important organism.
TI  - Cloning, characterization, and functional expression of the Klebsiella oxytoca xylodextrin utilization operon (xynTB) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli is being developed as a biocatalyst for bulk chemical production from inexpensive carbohydrates derived from lignocellulose. Potential substrates include the soluble xylodextrins (xyloside, xylooligosaccharide) and xylobiose that are produced by treatments designed to expose cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Adjacent genes encoding xylobiose uptake and hydrolysis were cloned from Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 and are functionally expressed in ethanologenic E. coli. The xylosidase encoded by xynB contains the COG3507 domain characteristic of glycosyl hydrolase family 43. The xynT gene encodes a membrane protein containing the MelB domain (COG2211) found in Na(+)/melibiose symporters and related proteins. These two genes form a bicistronic operon that appears to be regulated by xylose (XylR) and by catabolite repression in both K. oxytoca and recombinant E. coli. Homologs of this operon were found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus lactis, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Bacillus subtilis based on sequence comparisons. Based on similarities in protein sequence, the xynTB genes in K. oxytoca appear to have originated from a gram-positive ancestor related to L. lactis. Functional expression of xynB allowed ethanologenic E. coli to metabolize xylodextrins (xylosides) containing up to six xylose residues without the addition of enzyme supplements. 4-O-methylglucuronic acid substitutions at the nonreducing termini of soluble xylodextrins blocked further degradation by the XynB xylosidase. The rate of xylodextrin utilization by recombinant E. coli was increased when a full-length xynT gene was included with xynB, consistent with xynT functioning as a symport. Hydrolysis rates were inversely related to xylodextrin chain length, with xylobiose as the preferred substrate. Xylodextrins were utilized more rapidly by recombinant E. coli than K. oxytoca M5A1 (the source of xynT and xynB). XynB exhibited weak arabinosidase activity, 3% that of xylosidase.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferase genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum and Escherichia coli for the production of isoamyl acetate.
AB  - Esters are formed by the condensation of acids with alcohols. The esters isoamyl  acetate and butyl butyrate are used for food and beverage flavorings. Alcohol acetyltransferase is one enzyme responsible for the production of esters from acetyl-CoA and different alcohol substrates. The genes ATF1 and ATF2, encoding alcohol acetyltransferases from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been sequenced and characterized. The production of acids and alcohols in mass quantities by the industrially important Clostridium acetobutylicum makes it a potential organism for exploitation of alcohol acetyltransferase activity. This report focuses on the heterologous expression of the alcohol acetyltransferases in Escherichia coli and C. acetobutylicum. ATF1 and ATF2 were cloned and expressed in E. coli and ATF2 was expressed in C. acetobutylicum. Isoamyl acetate production from the substrate isoamyl alcohol in E. coli and C. acetobutylicum cultures was determined by head-space gas analysis. Alcohol acetyltransferase I produced more than twice as much isoamyl acetate as alcohol acetyltransferase II when expressed from a high-copy expression vector. The effect of substrate levels on ester production was explored in the two bacterial hosts to demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing ATF1 and ATF2 in bacteria for ester production.
TI  - Overexpression of groESL in Clostridium acetobutylicum results in increased solvent production and tolerance, prolonged metabolism, and changes in the cell's transcriptional program.
AB  - DNA array and Western analyses were used to examine the effects of groESL overexpression and host-plasmid interactions on solvent production in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Strain 824(pGROE1) was created to overexpress the groESL operon genes from a clostridial thiolase promoter. The growth of 824(pGROE1) was inhibited up to 85% less by a butanol challenge than that of the control strain, 824(pSOS95del). Overexpression of groESL resulted in increased final solvent titers 40% and 33% higher than those of the wild type and plasmid control strains, respectively. Active metabolism lasted two and one half times longer in 824(pGROE1) than in the wild type. Transcriptional analysis of 824(pGROE1) revealed increased expression of motility and chemotaxis genes and a decrease in the expression of the other major stress response genes. Decreased expression of the dnaKJ operon upon overexpression of groESL suggests that groESL functions as a modulator of the CIRCE regulon, which is shown here to include the hsp90 gene. Analysis of the plasmid control strain 824(pSOS95del) revealed complex host-plasmid interactions relative to the wild-type strain, resulting in prolonged biphasic growth and metabolism. Decreased expression of four DNA gyrases resulted in differential expression of many key primary metabolism genes. The ftsA and ftsZ genes were expressed at higher levels in 824(pSOS95del), revealing an altered cell division and sporulation pattern. Both transcriptional and Western analyses revealed elevated stress protein expression in the plasmid-carrying strain.
TI  - Expression of a cloned cyclopropane fatty acid synthase gene reduces solvent formation in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The cyclopropane fatty acid synthase gene (cfa) of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was cloned and overexpressed under the control of the clostridial ptb promoter. The function of the cfa gene was confirmed by complementation of an Escherichia coli cfa-deficient strain in terms of fatty acid composition and growth rate under solvent stress. Constructs expressing cfa were introduced into C. acetobutylicum hosts and cultured in rich glucose broth in static flasks without pH control. Overexpression of the cfa gene in the wild type and in a butyrate kinase-deficient strain increased the cyclopropane fatty acid content of early-log-phase cells as well as initial acid and butanol resistance. However, solvent production in the cfa-overexpressing strain was considerably decreased, while acetate and butyrate levels remained high. The findings suggest that overexpression of cfa results in changes in membrane properties that dampen the full induction of solventogenesis. The overexpression of a marR homologous gene preceding the cfa gene in the clostridial genome resulted in reduced cyclopropane fatty acid accumulation.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the gene for 2,6-beta-D-fructan 6-levanbiohydrolase from Streptomyces exfoliatus F3-2.
AB  - The gene encoding a 2,6-beta-D-fructan 6-levanbiohydrolase (LF2ase) (EC 3.2.1.64) that converts levan into levanbiose was cloned from the genomic DNA of Streptomyces exfoliatus F3-2. The gene encoded a signal peptide of 37 amino acids and a mature protein of 482 amino acids with a total length of 1560 bp and was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The similarities of primary structure were observed with levanases from Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus subtilis, B. stearothermophilus (51.0-54.3%) and with LF2ase from Microbacterium levaniformans (53.9%). The enzyme from S. exfoliatus F3-2 shared the conserved six domains and the completely conserved five amino acid residues with family 32 glycosyl hydrolases, which include levanase, inulinase, and invertase. These observations led to the conclusion that the enzyme belongs to family 32 glycosyl hydrolases.
TI  - Production by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 of CelG, a cellulosomal glycoside hydrolase belonging to family 9.
AB  - The genome sequence of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, a noncellulolytic solvent-producing strain, predicts the production of various proteins with domains typical for cellulosomal subunits. Most of the genes coding for these proteins are grouped in a cluster similar to that found in cellulolytic clostridial species, such as Clostridium cellulovorans. CAC0916, one of the open reading frames present in the putative cellulosome gene cluster, codes for CelG, a putative endoglucanase belonging to family 9, and it was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The overproduced CelG protein was purified by making use of its high affinity for cellulose and was characterized. The biochemical properties of the purified CelG were comparable to those of other known enzymes belonging to the same family. Expression of CelG by C. acetobutylicum grown on different substrates was studied by Western blotting by using antibodies raised against the purified E. coli-produced protein. Whereas the antibodies cross-reacted with CelG-like proteins secreted by cellobiose- or cellulose-grown C. cellulovorans cultures, CelG was not detectable in extracellular medium from C. acetobutylicum grown on cellobiose or glucose. However, notably, when lichenan-grown cultures were used, several bands corresponding to CelG or CelG-like proteins were present, and there was significantly increased extracellular endoglucanase activity.
TI  - The effect of carbon sources and lactate dehydrogenase deletion on 1,2-propanediol production in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In previous studies, we showed that cofactor manipulations can potentially be used as a tool in metabolic engineering. In this study, sugars similar to glucose, that can feed into glycolysis and pyruvate production, but with different oxidation states, were used as substrates. This provided a simple way of testing the effect of manipulating the NADH/NAD+ ratio or the availability of NADH on the metabolic patterns of Escherichia coli under anaerobic conditions and on the production of 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD), which requires NADH for its synthesis. Production of 1,2-PD was achieved by overexpressing the two enzymes methylglyoxal synthase from Clostridium acetobutylicum and glycerol dehydrogenase from E. coli. In addition, the effect of eliminating a pathway competing for NADH by using a ldh(-) strain (without lactate dehydrogenase activity) on the production of 1,2-PD was investigated. The oxidation state of the carbon source significantly affected the yield of metabolites, such as ethanol, acetate and lactate. However, feeding a more reduced carbon source did not increase the yield of 1,2-PD. The production of 1,2-PD with glucose as the carbon source was improved by the incorporation of a ldh(-) mutation. The results of these experiments indicate that our current 1,2-PD production system is not limited by NADH, but rather by the pathways following the formation of methylglyoxal.
TI  - Characterization of the CipA scaffolding protein and in vivo production of a minicellulosome in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The cipA gene encoding the Clostridium acetobutylicum scaffolding protein CipA was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. CipA contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a family 3a cellulose-binding domain (CBD), five type I cohesin domains, and six hydrophilic domains. The uniqueness of CipA lies in the enchainment of cohesin domains that are all separated by a hydrophilic domain. Affinity-purified CipA was used in equilibrium-binding experiments to characterize the interaction of CipA with crystalline cellulose. A K(d) of 0.038 micro M and a [C](max) of 0.43 micro mol of CipA bound per g of Avicel were determined. A mini-CipA polypeptide consisting of a CBD3a and two cohesin domains was overexpressed in C. acetobutylicum, yielding the in vivo formation of a minicellulosome. This is to our knowledge the first demonstration of the in vivo assembly of a recombinant minicellulosome.
TI  - Cloning and molecular characterization of an immunogenic LigA protein of Leptospira interrogans.
AB  - A clone expressing a novel immunoreactive leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein A of 130 kDa (LigA) from Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona type kennewicki was isolated by screening a genomic DNA library with serum from a mare that had recently aborted due to leptospiral infection. LigA is encoded by an open reading frame of 3,675 bp, and the deduced amino acid sequence consists of a series of 90-amino-acid tandem repeats. A search of the NCBI database found that homology of the LigA repeat region was limited to an immunoglobulin-like domain of the bacterial intimin binding protein of Escherichia coli, the cell adhesion domain of Clostridium acetobutylicum, and the invasin of Yersinia pestis. Secondary structure prediction analysis indicates that LigA consists mostly of beta sheets with a few alpha-helical regions. No LigA was detectable by immunoblot analysis of lysates of the leptospires grown in vitro at 30 degrees C or when cultures were shifted to 37 degrees C. Strikingly, immunohistochemistry on kidney from leptospira-infected hamsters demonstrated LigA expression. These findings suggest that LigA is specifically induced only in vivo. Sera from horses, which aborted as a result of natural Leptospira infection, strongly recognize LigA. LigA is the first leptospiral protein described to have 12 tandem repeats and is also the first to be expressed only during infection. Thus, LigA may have value in serodiagnosis or as a protective immunogen in novel vaccines.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant nonphosphorylating  NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum gapN was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21. The IPTG-induced nonphosphorylating NADP-dependent GAPDH (GAPN) has been purified about 34-fold from E. coli cells and its physical and kinetic properties were investigated. The purification method consisted of a rapid and straightforward procedure involving anion-exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatographies. The purified protein is an homotetrameric of 204kDa exhibiting absolute specificity for NADP. Chromatofocusing analysis showed the presence of only one acidic GAPN isoform with an acid isoelectric point of 4.2. The optimum pH of purified enzyme was 8.2. Studies on the effect of assay temperature on enzyme activity revealed an optimal value of about 65 degrees C with activation energy of 18KJmol(-1). The apparent K(m) values for NADP and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-G3P) or DL-G3P were estimated to be 0.200+/-0.05 and 0.545+/-0.1 mM, respectively. No inhibition was observed with L-D3P. The V(max) of the purified protein was estimated to be 78.8 U mg(-1). The Cl. acetobutylicum GAPN was markedly inhibited by sulfhydryl-modifying reagent iodoacetamide, these results suggest the participation of essential sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic activity.
TI  - Clostridium as a tumor-specific delivery system of therapeutic proteins.
AB  - The feasibility of gene therapy strategies in cancer treatment still has important pitfalls. Transfer of therapeutic proteins to the hypoxic/necrotic 'extracellular' microenvironment of solid tumors, based on the engineering of nonpathogenic clostridia is proposed as an alternative methodology. Using the rat rhabdomyosarcoma R1 in vivo tumor model, we demonstrated that Clostridium species colonized the tumors, whereas proliferation of these bacteria was absent in normal tissues. C. acetobutylicum was genetically engineered to express and secrete either mTNF-alpha or the E. coli cytosine deaminase. Quantitative in vitro data showed stability of the vectors, and significant levels of biologically active therapeutic proteins in lysates and supernatants of recombinant clostridia. Administration of either of these recombinant Clostridium strains to tumor-bearing rats resulted in the presence of active proteins in the tumor tissue. Based on these data and supported by its selective colonization pattern and safety, the Clostridium gene transfer system offers a potential application in anti-cancer therapies.
TI  - Molecular characterization and utilization of the CAK1 filamentous viruslike particle derived from Clostridium beijerinckii.
AB  - An examination of the replication origin and stability determinant associated with the CAK1 filamentous viruslike particle recovered from Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 6444 was carried out. Seven deletion derivatives, pCKE, pCEP1, pDT5, pCKP, pDTH102, pYL102E and pYL102, were constructed and transformed into C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. The successful transformation of pCKE, pDT5, pCKP, pDTH102, pYL102E and pYL102 into C. beijerinckii 8052, together with the corresponding recovery of single-stranded DNA from Escherichia coli indicated that the double- and single-stranded replication origins are located on a 0.4-kb CAK1 DNA fragment. Sequence analysis of the putative 0.4-kb replication origin region of CAK1 reveals a nick site containing 22 base pairs that has homology with plasmids pC194 and pUB110 and suggests the presence of a 2.0-kb DNA region involved in stability. The putative Rep protein of CAK1 contains three conserved motifs and three essential residues of the catalytic site in agreement with Rep proteins associated with the pC194 family. The utility of the developed CAK1-derived phagemid designated pYL102E was evaluated by using it to examine heterologous expression of: (1) the manA gene derived from Thermoanaerobacterium polysaccharolyticum in E. coli and C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 and (2) the sol operon derived from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 in C. beijerinckii SA-2.
TI  - Molecular characterization and transcriptional analysis of adhE2, the gene encoding the NADH-dependent aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase responsible for butanol production in alcohologenic cultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The adhE2 gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, coding for an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AADH), was characterized from molecular and biochemical points of view. The 2,577-bp adhE2 codes for a 94.4-kDa protein. adhE2 is expressed, as a monocistronic operon, in alcohologenic cultures and not in solventogenic cultures. Primer extension analysis identified two transcriptional start sites 160 and 215 bp upstream of the adhE2 start codon. The expression of adhE2 from a plasmid in the DG1 mutant of C. acetobutylicum, a mutant cured of the pSOL1 megaplasmid, restored butanol production and provided elevated activities of NADH-dependent butyraldehyde and butanol dehydrogenases. The recombinant AdhE2 protein expressed in E. coli as a Strep-tag fusion protein and purified to homogeneity also demonstrated NADH-dependent butyraldehyde and butanol dehydrogenase activities. This is the second AADH identified in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, and to our knowledge this is the first example of a bacterium with two AADHs. It is noteworthy that the two corresponding genes, adhE and adhE2, are carried by the pSOL1 megaplasmid of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
TI  - Orf5/SolR: a transcriptional repressor of the sol operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum?
AB  - The gene of Orf5 (SolR) of Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 was subcloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified with Ni-NTA agarose and used for DNA binding assays. No DNA binding of Orf5 to regions upstream of the sol operon from C. acetobutylicum was observed. Overexpression of Orf5 in C. acetobutylicum led to a change in the organism's pattern of glycosylated exoproteins. The Orf5 protein was localized in the cell membrane fraction and to a small extent in the supernatant medium. Based on these results Orf5 (SolR) appears not to act as a transcriptional repressor in C. acetobutylicum, but instead may be an enzyme involved in glycosylation or deglycosylation.
TI  - Expression of the Klebsiella pneumoniae CG21 acetoin reductase gene in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Acetoin reductase catalyzes the production of 2,3-butanediol from acetoin. The gene encoding the acetoin reductase of Klebsiella pneumoniae CG21 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the enzyme was determined to be 768 bp long. Expression of the K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene in E. coli revealed that the enzyme has a molecular mass of about 31,000 Da based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene was cloned into a clostridial/E. coli shuttle vector, and expression of the gene resulted in detectable levels of acetoin reductase activity in both E. coli and C. acetobutylicum. While acetoin, the natural substrate of acetoin reductase, is a typical product of fermentation by C. acetobutylicum, 2,3-butanediol is not. Analysis of culture supernatants by gas chromatography revealed that introduction of the K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene into C. acetobutylicum was not sufficient for 2,3-butanediol production even though the cultures were producing acetoin. 2,3-Butanediol was produced by cultures of C. acetobutylicum containing the gene only when commercial acetoin was added.
TI  - Specific targeting of cytosine deaminase to solid tumors by engineered Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The presence of severe hypoxia and necrosis in solid tumors offers the potential  to apply an anaerobic bacterial enzyme/prodrug approach in cancer treatment. In this context the apathogenic C. acetobutylicum was genetically engineered to express and secrete E. coli cytosine deaminase (CDase). Considerable levels of functional cytosine deaminase were detected in lysates and supernatants of recombinant C acetobutylicum cultures. After administration of the recombinant Clostridium to rhabdomyosarcoma bearing rats used as a model, cytosine deaminase could be detected at the tumor site. Moreover, following administration of the vascular targeting agent combretastatin A-4 phosphate significantly increased levels of cytosine deaminase were detected at the tumor site as a consequence of enlarged tumor necrosis and subsequently improved growth of C. acetobutylicum. The results provide evidence for the potential application of Clostrisdium-based therapeutic protein transfer to tumors in anticancer therapy.
TI  - Analysis of KdpC of the K(+)-transporting KdpFABC complex of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Kdp complex, a high affinity ATP-driven K(+) transport system of Escherichia  coli, is composed of the four membrane-bound subunits KdpF, KdpA, KdpB and KdpC. Whereas the role of KdpB (catalytical subunit), KdpA (K(+)-translocating subunit) and KdpF (stabilizing peptide) is well understood, the function of KdpC is still unknown. Therefore, a kdpC deletion strain was constructed and complementation experiments were performed using different kdpC constructs. Truncations of the kdpC gene revealed that only one derivative, which lacks base pairs coding for the four C-terminal amino acids, was able to complement the chromosomal deletion of kdpC. Furthermore, complementation was also observed with kdpC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but not with kdpC from Clostridium acetobutylicum or Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Sequence alignment of 17 different KdpC proteins led to the construction of hybrids between kdpC of E. coli and that of C. acetobutylicum. Complementation revealed that the N-terminal transmembrane segment as well as the C-terminal-third of the protein can be exchanged between both species, but only one after the other. A simultaneous substitution of both regions was not possible.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the mannitol operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum encoding  a phosphotransferase system and a putative PTS-modulated regulator.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 accumulates and phosphorylates mannitol via a  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). PEP-dependent mannitol phosphorylation by extracts of cells grown on mannitol required both soluble and membrane fractions. Neither the soluble nor the membrane fraction could be complemented by the opposite fraction prepared from glucose-grown cells, indicating that the mannitol-specific PTS consists of both a soluble (IIA) and a membrane-bound (IICB) component. The mannitol (mtl) operon of C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 comprises four genes in the order mtlARFD. Sequence analysis of deduced protein products indicated that the mtlA and mtlF genes respectively encode the IICB and IIA components of the mannitol PTS, which is a member of the fructose-mannitol (Fru) family. The mtlD gene product is a mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, while mtlR encodes a putative transcriptional regulator. MtlR contains two PTS regulatory domains (PRDs), which have been found in a number of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators and in transcriptional antiterminators of the Escherichia coli BglG family. Also, near the C-terminus is a well-conserved signature motif characteristic of members of the IIA(Fru)/IIA(Mtl)/IIA(Ntr) PTS protein family. These regions are probably the sites of PTS-dependent phosphorylation to regulate the activity of the protein. A helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif was not found in MtlR. Transcriptional analysis of the mtl genes by Northern blotting indicated that the genes were transcribed as a polycistronic operon, expression of which was induced by mannitol and repressed by glucose. Primer extension experiments identified a transcriptional start point 42 bp upstream of the mtlA start codon. Two catabolite-responsive elements (CREs), one of which overlapped the putative -35 region of the promoter, were located within the 100 bp upstream of the start codon. These sequences may be involved in regulation of expression of the operon.
TI  - Differential regulation of two thiolase genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792.
AB  - Thiolase of Clostridium acetobutylicum is an important enzyme involved in both, acid and solvent fermentation. Two thiolase genes (thlA and thIB) have been cloned and sequenced from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792, showing high homology to each other and to thiolases of PHA-synthesizing bacteria. The thlA gene is identical to the gene already cloned and sequenced from strain ATCC 824 (Stim-Herndon et al., 1995, Gene 154: 81-85). Using primer extension and S1 nuclease analysis a transcriptional start site was identified 102 bp upstream of the thlA start codon. This site was preceded by a region that exhibits high similarity to the sigma70 consensus promoter sequences of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Regulation of thlA and thlB was studied at the transcriptional level to elucidate the specific function of each gene. Non-radioactive primer extension analysis using fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotides and Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of thlA transcripts in acid- and solvent-producing cells. During an induced shift of a continuous culture from acid to solvent formation, the transcript level transiently decreased to a minimum, 3 to 7 h after induction. The thlA transcript length is about 1.4 kb, indicating a monocistronic organisation, whereas genetic organization and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that thlB forms an operon with two other adjacent genes, thlR and thlC. Transcription and regulation of the thlB operon was studied using RTPCR and showed a very low expression in acid- and solvent-producing cells. Heterologously expressed clostridial ThlB showed high thiolase activity in Escherichia coli. The N-terminal part of ThlR possesses a potential helix-turn-helix motif and shows significant homology to regulatory proteins belonging to the TetR/AcrR family of transcriptional regulators. ThlR possibly acts as a transcriptional repressor of thlB operon expression. The data provide strong evidence that ThlA is involved in the metabolism of both acid and solvent formation, whereas the physiological function of ThlB has yet to be elucidated.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the DNA gyrase (gyrA) gene from Mycoplasma hominis and characterization of quinolone-resistant mutants selected in vitro with trovafloxacin.
AB  - We report the cloning and characterization of the gyrA gene of the Mycoplasma hominis DNA gyrase, which was previously shown to be associated with quinolone resistance in this organism. The 2,733-bp gyrA gene encodes a protein of 911 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 102.5 kDa. As expected, M. hominis GyrA exhibits higher homology with the GyrA subunits of the gram-positive bacteria Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus than with its Escherichia coli counterpart. Knowing the entire sequence of the gyrA gene of M. hominis could be very useful for confirming the role of the GyrA subunit in fluoroquinolone resistance. Twenty-nine mutants of M. hominis were selected stepwise for resistance to trovafloxacin, a new potent fluoroquinolone, and their gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE quinolone resistance-determining regions were characterized. Three rounds of selection yielded 3 first-step, 12 second-step, and 14 third-step mutants. The first-step mutants harbored a single substitution, Glu460-->Lys (E. coli coordinates), in ParE. GyrA changes, Ser83-->Leu, Glu87-->Lys, and Ala119-->Glu or Val, were found only in the second round of selection. At the third step, additional substitutions, at ParC Ser80, Ser81, and Glu84 and ParE Leu440, associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones, appeared. Thus, high-level resistance to trovafloxacin required three steps and was associated with alterations in both fluoroquinolone targets. According to these genetic data, in M. hominis, as in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, topoisomerase IV seems to be the primary target of trovafloxacin.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - KdpE of Clostridium acetobutylicum is a highly specific response regulator controlling only the expression of the kdp operon.
AB  - KdpE from Clostridium acetobutylicum was enriched in form of its Strep-tag-derivative to allow easy immunodetection. It could be artificially phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate or carbamyl phosphate. Only phosphorylated clostridial KdpE was able to bind to a region upstream of the clostridial kdp structural genes. The minimal sequence requirements for binding were determined and found to share significant similarity with the Escherichia coli KdpE binding motif. However, the clostridial protein proved to be much more specific and did not bind in unphosphorylated form or to other similar sequences either from C. acetobutylicum or E. coli. In contrast, the enterobacterial protein recognized the clostridial binding motif. An HPt domain has been detected in KdpD from C. acetobutylicum, the cognate sensor kinase of KdpE. The data reported indicate that in E. coli, KdpE might represent a regulatory checkpoint for different phosphorelay signalling pathways, whereas in C. acetobutylicum KdpD might serve this function.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a second butyrate kinase from Clostridium  acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - A gene encoding a new butyrate kinase isozyme (BKII) was identified from the C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 DNA database. The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The purified enzyme exhibited a subunit molecular mass of 43 kDa by SDS-PAGE, and a native molecular mass of 80 kDa by gel filtration suggesting it functions as a dimer. In the butyryl phosphate-forming direction the optimal pH of BKII was 8.5. The enzyme had a Km of 0.62 M and a turn over rate of 2.2 x 10(5)/sec (Vmax of 165 units/mg). The presence of a mRNA encoding the BKII was demonstrated using a reverse transcription PCR reaction. The expression of the BKII in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was further examined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody prepared against recombinant BKII.
TI  - Identification of two genes encoding putative new members of the ECF subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Two genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 were identified which are predicted to encode new members of the ECF subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors. The sigX gene has the potential to encode a 184-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 21,870 Da and with the highest overall similarity to Fecl of Escherichia coli (27 % identical residues). The second gene, which is predicted to encode an alternative sigma factor of the ECF subfamily, is the previously described orf2 gene (Gerischer and Durre, 1990) located in the adc gene region of C. acetobutylicum. The deduced protein of orf2 has significant similarity to SigX of C. acetobutylicum (22 % identical residues) and shares structural features with other alternative sigma factors. Therefore, it is proposed to rename orf2 as sigY. Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship revealed that SigX from C. acetobutylicum, together with sigmaE from Streptomyces coelicolor and SigX from Bacillus subtilis, form a gram-positive cluster within the ECF subfamily and that SigY from C. acetobutylicum together with UviA from Clostridium perfringens, form a separate cluster located between the gram-positive cluster and the sporulation sigma factor sigmaH from B. subtilis.
TI  - Exploitation of butyrate kinase and phosphotransbutyrylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum for the in vitro biosynthesis of poly(hydroxyalkanoic acid).
AB  - Active butyrate kinase (Buk) and phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) were purified in three steps: ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and affinity chromatography on Matrex Red A from recombinant Escherichia coli K2006 (pJC7). They were then successfully exploited for in vitro synthesis of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3HBCoA), 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (4HBCoA), 4-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA (4HVCoA) and poly(hydroxyalkanoic acid) (PHA). In addition, the ability of the PHA synthase of Chromatium vinosum, PhaEC(Cv), to use these CoA thioesters was evaluated. Combination of Buk and Ptb with PhaEC(Cv) established a new system for in vitro synthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) [poly(3HB)]. In this system, 3-hydroxybutyric acid was converted to 3HBCoA by Buk and Ptb at the expense of ATP. Formation of 3HBCoA was further driven by the polymerization of 3HBCoA molecules to poly(3HB) by PHA synthase, and the released CoA was recycled by Ptb. This system therefore also ensured the regeneration of CoA. With ATP as the energy supply, which was hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate, 2.6 mg poly(3HB) was obtained from a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 7.6 mg 3-hydroxybutyrate at the beginning. Studies showed that Ptb and PHA synthase were the rate-limiting steps in this system, and initial CoA concentrations ranging from 1 to 7 mM did not inhibit poly(3HB) synthesis. Synthesis of various polyesters of 3HB and 4HB with this system was also tested, and copolyesters containing 4HB of 1-46 mol % were obtained.
TI  - A novel genetically engineered pathway for synthesis of poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A new pathway to synthesize poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids) (PHA) was constructed by  simultaneously expressing butyrate kinase (Buk) and phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) genes of Clostridium acetobutylicum and the two PHA synthase genes (phaE and phaC) of Thiocapsa pfennigii in Escherichia coli. The four genes were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBR322, and the resulting hybrid plasmid, pBPP1, conferred activities of all three enzymes to E. coli JM109. Cells of this recombinant strain accumulated PHAs when hydroxyfatty acids were provided as carbon sources. Homopolyesters of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB), or 4-hydroxyvalerate (4HV) were obtained from each of the corresponding hydroxyfatty acids. Various copolyesters of those hydroxyfatty acids were also obtained when two of these hydroxyfatty acids were fed at equal amounts: cells fed with 3HB and 4HB accumulated a copolyester consisting of 88 mol% 3HB and 12 mol% 4HB and contributing to 68.7% of the cell dry weight. Cells fed with 3HB and 4HV accumulated a copolyester consisting of 94 mol% 3HB and 6 mol% 4HV and contributing to 64.0% of the cell dry weight. Cells fed with 3HB, 4HB, and 4HV accumulated a terpolyester consisting of 85 mol% 3HB, 13 mol% 4HB, and 2 mol% 4HV and contributing to 68.4% of the cell dry weight.
TI  - Characterization of recombinant strains of the Clostridium acetobutylicum butyrate kinase inactivation mutant: need for new phenomenological models for solventogenesis and butanol inhibition?
AB  - Two metabolic engineering tools, namely gene inactivation and gene overexpression, were employed to examine the effects of two genetic modifications on the fermentation characteristics of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Inactivation of the butyrate kinase gene (buk) was examined using strain PJC4BK, while the combined effect of buk inactivation and overexpression of the aad gene-encoding the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogense (AAD) used in butanol formation-was examined using strain PJC4BK(pTAAD). The two strains were characterized in controlled pH > or = 5.0 fermentations, and by a recently enhanced method of metabolic flux analysis. Strain PJC4BK was previously genetically characterized, and fermentation experiments at pH > or = 5.5 demonstrated good, but not exceptional, solvent-production capabilities. Here, we show that this strain is a solvent superproducer in pH > or = 5.0 fermentations producing 225 mM (16.7 g/L) of butanol, 76 mM of acetone (4.4 g/L), and 57 mM (2.6 g/L) of ethanol. Strain PJC4BK(pTAAD) produced similar amounts of butanol and acetone but 98 mM (4.5 g/L) of ethanol. Both strains overcame the 180 mM (13 g/L) butanol toxicity limit, without any selection for butanol tolerance. Work with strain PJC4BK(pTAAD) is the first reported use of dual antibiotic selection in C. acetobutylicum. One antibiotic was used for selection of strain PJC4BK while the second antibiotic selected for the pTAAD presence. Overexpression of aad from pTAAD resulted in increased ethanol production but did not increase butanol titers, thus indicating that AAD did not limit butanol production under these fermentation conditions. Metabolic flux analysis showed a decrease in butyrate formation fluxes by up to 75% and an increase in acetate formation fluxes of up to 100% during early growth. The mean specific butanol and ethanol formation fluxes increased significantly in these recombinant strains, up to 300% and 400%, respectively. Onset of solvent production occurred during the exponential-growth phase when the culture optical density was very low and when total and undissociated butyric acid levels were <1 mM. Butyrate levels were low throughout all fermentations, never exceeding 20 mM. Thus, threshold butyrate concentrations are not necessary for solvent production in these stains, suggesting the need for a new phenomenological model to explain solvent formation.
TI  - The ald gene, encoding a coenzyme A-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase, distinguishes Clostridium beijerinckii and two other solvent-producing clostridia from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The coenzyme A (CoA)-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) catalyzes a key reaction in the acetone- and butanol (solvent)-producing clostridia. It reduces acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA to the corresponding aldehydes, which are then reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to form ethanol and 1-butanol. The ALDH of Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B593 was purified. It had no ADH activity, was NAD(H) specific, and was more active with butyraldehyde than with acetaldehyde. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified ALDH was determined. The open reading frame preceding the ctfA gene (encoding a subunit of the solvent-forming CoA transferase) of C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 was identified as the structural gene (ald) for the ALDH. The ald gene encodes a polypeptide of 468 amino acid residues with a calculated M(r) of 51, 353. The position of the ald gene in C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 corresponded to that of the aad/adhE gene (encoding an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase) of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and DSM 792. In Southern analyses, a probe derived from the C. acetobutylicum aad/adhE gene did not hybridize to restriction fragments of the genomic DNAs of C. beijerinckii and two other species of solvent-producing clostridia. In contrast, a probe derived from the C. beijerinckii ald gene hybridized to restriction fragments of the genomic DNA of three solvent-producing species but not to those of C. acetobutylicum, indicating a key difference among the solvent-producing clostridia. The amino acid sequence of the ALDH of C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 was most similar (41% identity) to those of the eutE gene products (CoA-acylating ALDHs) of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, whereas it was about 26% identical to the ALDH domain of the aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenases of C. acetobutylicum, E. coli, Lactococcus lactis, and amitochondriate protozoa. The predicted secondary structure of the C. beijerinckii ALDH suggests the presence of an atypical Rossmann fold for NAD(+) binding. A comparison of the proposed catalytic pockets of the CoA-dependent and CoA-independent ALDHs identified 6 amino acids that may contribute to interaction with CoA.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the dnaK gene region from Bacillus sphaericus in the context of genomic comparisons.
AB  - The dnaK gene region of Bacillus sphaericus was cloned as a 3.8 kb HindIII fragment and an overlapping 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment by using an internal B. sphaericus specific dnaK gene probe generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Complete DNA sequencing of the two fragments revealed three complete open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs exhibited a high degree of identity to the grpE dnaK, and dnaJ heat shock genes from other gram-positive bacteria. The order of the genes was found to be grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. Additionally, the 5'-end and 3'-end contained amino acid sequences that were homologous to the C-terminal sequence of the hrcA gene and the N-terminal sequence of ORF35 (yqeT), respectively, from Bacillus subtilis. The entire hrcA gene from B. sphaericus was then isolated by high-fidelity PCR and completely sequenced. A transcription stop site is located between the dnaK and dnaJ genes but not after the dnaJ gene. Consistent with this observation, the dnaJ gene is immediately followed by an ORF that shows a high degree of identity to ORF35 from B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The presence of ORF35 is not indicated in other genera representing the gram-positive bacteria. The amino acid sequence of ORF35 exhibited nearly 30% identity with the methyltransferase for large subunit ribosomal protein L11 from gram-negative Proteobacteria and the related protein from cyanobacteria, other gram-negative bacteria, and Archaea, suggesting the presence of the gene for this protein in the common ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea. The absence of the ORF35 gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other gram-positive bacteria indicates that the loss of this gene must have occurred in an ancestor of other gram-positive bacteria following their divergence from the ancestor of Bacillus/Clostridium/staphylococcus lineage.
TI  - Stable Escherichia coli-Clostridium acetobutylicum shuttle vector for secretion of murine tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  - Recombinant plasmids were constructed to secrete mouse tumor necrosis factor alpha (mTNF-alpha) from Clostridium acetobutylicum. The shuttle plasmids contained the clostridial endo-beta1, 4-glucanase (eglA) promoter and signal sequence that was fused in frame to the mTNF-alpha cDNA. The construction was first tested in Escherichia coli and then introduced in C. acetobutylicum DSM792 by electroporation. Controls confirmed the presence and stability of the recombinant plasmids in this organism. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an in vitro cytotoxic assay were used to monitor expression and secretion of mTNF-alpha during growth. Significant levels of biologically active mTNF-alpha were measured in both lysates and supernatants. The present report deals with investigations on the elaboration of a gene transfer system for cancer treatment using anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Catabolism of branched-chain alpha-keto acids in Enterococcus faecalis: the bkd gene cluster, enzymes, and metabolic route.
AB  - Genes encoding a branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis 10C1, E1alpha (bkdA), E1beta (bkdB), E2 (bkdC), and E3 (bkdD), were found to reside in the gene cluster ptb-buk-bkdDABC. The predicted products of ptb and buk exhibited significant homology to the phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase, respectively, from Clostridium acetobutylicum. Activity and redox properties of the purified recombinant enzyme encoded by bkdD indicate that E. faecalis has a lipoamide dehydrogenase that is distinct from the lipoamide dehydrogenase associated with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Specific activity of the ptb gene product expressed in Escherichia coli was highest with the substrates valeryl-coenzyme A (CoA), isovaleryl-CoA, and isobutyryl-CoA. In cultures, a stoichiometric conversion of alpha-ketoisocaproate to isovalerate was observed, with a concomitant increase in biomass. We propose that alpha-ketoisocaproate is converted via the BKDH complex to isovaleryl-CoA and subsequently converted into isovalerate via the combined actions of the ptb and buk gene products with the concomitant phosphorylation of ADP. In contrast, an E. faecalis bkd mutant constructed by disruption of the bkdA gene did not benefit from having alpha-ketoisocaproate in the growth medium, and conversion to isovalerate was less than 2% of the wild-type conversion. It is concluded that the bkd gene cluster encodes the enzymes that constitute a catabolic pathway for branched-chain alpha-keto acids that was previously unidentified in E. faecalis.
TI  - The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum: isolation and purification of the enzyme, and sequencing and localization of the gap gene within a cluster of other glycolytic genes.
AB  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purified from Clostridium acetobutylicum by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography (to a specific activity of 27 U mg-1). The enzyme had a molecular mass of 40 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and a native molecular mass of 160 kDa as determined by nondenaturing PAGE, indicating that it has a homotetrameric composition. Its pH optimum was between 8.5 and 9.3. The corresponding gene (gap) was cloned and sequenced from C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 and found to cluster with other genes of enzymes from the glycolytic pathway (pgk, phosphoglycerate kinase; tpi, triosephosphate isomerase; pgm(i), 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase). No sequences resembling rho-independent transcription terminators were found in the intergenic regions. A plasmid carrying the clostridial gap gene complemented an Escherichia coli gap mutant.
TI  - Characterization of methylglyoxal synthase from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and its use in the formation of 1, 2-propanediol.
AB  - A gene encoding a putative 150-amino-acid methylglyoxal synthase was identified in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Methylglyoxal synthase has a native molecular mass of 60 kDa and an optimum pH of 7.5. The Km and Vmax values for the substrate dihydroxyacetone phosphate were 0.53 mM and 1.56 mmol min(-1) microgram(-1), respectively. When E. coli glycerol dehydrogenase was coexpressed with methylglyoxal synthase in E. coli BL21(DE3), 3.9 mM 1,2-propanediol was produced.
TI  - Genetic manipulation of acid and solvent formation in clostridium acetobutylicum  ATCC 824
AB  - The genes coding for enzymes involved in butanol or butyrate formation were subcloned into a novel Escherichia coli-Clostridium acetobutylicum shuttle vector constructed from pIMP1 and a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene. The resulting replicative plasmids, referred to as pTHAAD (aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase) and pTHBUT (butyrate operon), were used to complement C. acetobutylicum mutant strains, in which genes encoding aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (aad) or butyrate kinase (buk) had been inactivated by recombination with Emr constructs. Complementation of strain PJC4BK (buk mutant) with pTHBUT restored butyrate kinase activity and butyrate production during exponential growth. Complementation of strain PJC4AAD (aad mutant) with pTHAAD restored NAD(H)-dependent butanol dehydrogenase activity, NAD(H)-dependent butyraldehyde dehydrogenase activity and butanol production during solventogenic growth. The development of an alternative selectable marker makes it is possible to overexpress genes, via replicative plasmids, in mutant strains that lack specific enzyme activities, thereby expanding the number of possible genetic manipulations that can be performed in C. acetobutylicum.

TI  - The S box regulon: a new global transcription termination control system for methionine and cysteine biosynthesis genes in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The molecular mechanisms for regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine are poorly characterized in Bacillus subtilis. Analyses of the recently completed B. subtilis genome revealed 11 copies of a highly conserved motif. In all cases, this motif was located in the leader region of putative transcriptional units, upstream of coding sequences that included genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. Additional copies were identified in Clostridium acetobutylicum and Staphylococcus aureus, indicating conservation in other Gram-positive genera. The motif includes an element resembling an intrinsic transcriptional terminator, suggesting that regulation might be controlled at the level of premature termination of transcription. The 5' portion of all of the leaders could fold into a conserved complex structure. Analysis of the yitJ gene, which is homologous to Escherichia coli metH and metF, revealed that expression was induced by starvation for methionine and that induction was independent of the promoter and dependent on the leader region terminator. Mutation of conserved primary sequence and structural elements supported a model in which the 5' portion of the leader forms an anti-antiterminator structure, which sequesters sequences required for the formation of an antiterminator, which, in turn, sequesters sequences required for the formation of the terminator; the anti-antiterminator is postulated to be stabilized by the binding of some unknown factor when methionine is available. This set of genes is proposed to form a new regulon controlled by a global termination control system, which we designate the S box system, as most of the genes are involved in sulphur metabolism and biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine.
TI  - Functional characterisation of the chaperones DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The DnaK chaperone system is involved in various cellular processes such as the control of the folded and oligomeric state of proteins under stress and non-stress conditions. In this study we functionally characterised the homologues of the DnaK system from Clostridium acetobutylicum DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE and OrfA were heterologously synthesised in Escherichia coli and affinity purified via a His-tag. By optimising the stoichiometry, we were able to refold guanidinium hydrochloride-denatured firefly luciferase in vitro with 22% of the yield obtained with the E. coli DnaK system. In addition, C. acetobutylicum DnaJ could stimulate the E. coli DnaK ATPase by a factor of 55. Furthermore, the DnaK system from C. acetobutylicum was able to prevent the aggregation of OrfA from C. acetobutylicum, which is similar to the repressor HrcA of CIRCE-regulated heat shock genes in Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - The hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima has two different classes of  family C DNA polymerases: evolutionary implications.
AB  - Bacterial DNA polymerase III (family C DNA polymerase), the principal chromosomal replicative enzyme, is known to occur in at least three distinct forms which have provisionally been classified as class I ( Escherichia coli DNA pol C-type), class II ( Bacillus subtilis DNA pol C-type) and class III (cyanobacteria DNA pol C-type). We have identified two family C DNA polymerase sequences in the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. One DNA polymerase consisting of 842 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 97 213 belongs to class I. The other one, consisting of 1367 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 155 361, is a member of class II. Comparative sequence analyses suggest that the class II DNA polymerase is the principal DNA replicative enzyme of the microbe and that the class I DNA polymerase may be functionally inactive. A phylogenetic analysis using the class II enzyme indicates that T.maritima is closely related to the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, in particular to Clostridium acetobutylicum, and mycoplasmas. These results are in conflict with 16S rRNA-based phylogenies, which placed T.maritima as one of the deepest branches of the bacterial tree.
TI  - Cloning of an EF-P homologue from Bacteroides fragilis that increases B. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Investigations of possible regulators of Bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (GS) activity were done in Escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. The B. fragilis glnA gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pACYC184 and expressed in the E. coli glnA ntrB ntrC deletion strain, YMC11. GS activity was monitored following co-transformation with a B. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pEcoR251. A gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in B. fragilis GS activity but did not affect the activity of the E. coli GS enzyme or the B. fragilis sucrase (ScrL). Deletion of the B. fragilis glnA downstream region decreased basal levels of GS activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the B. fragilis GS activity. Reporter gene analysis, using the B. fragilis glnA promoter region fused to the promoterless Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. This demonstrated that the increase in GS activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. Sequence data indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor P (EF-P) proteins, the highest being to that of a Synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to Mycobacterium genitalium (27%). Amino acid identity to the E. coli EF-P was intermediate (37%). A possible role for EF-P in enhancing translation of the B. fragilis glnA mRNA is proposed.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and expression of the phosphofructokinase gene of Clostridium  acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The pfk gene encoding phosphofructokinase (Pfk) from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was cloned and sequenced. The gene was identified in a plasmid library by complementation of an E. coli pfk mutant and by the ability to amplify a fragment by PCR using primers based on homologous regions of Pfk from other microorganisms. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a coding region for a 319-aa protein homologous to Pfks from other organisms. Enzyme assay and ability to complement the growth defects of E. coli pfk mutants confirmed the expression of the clostridial pfk gene. The pyruvate kinase (pyk) gene was identified adjacent to pfk. Such an arrangement for the genes encoding key regulators of glycolytic flux had not yet been described in a strict anaerobe. This gene arrangement has been found in other Gram-positive organisms, but not in Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Complementation of an Escherichia coli polypeptide deformylase mutant with a gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 DNA containing the 3' end of a PriA homolog, deformylase (def), and the 5' end of formyltransferase (fmt) has been cloned, sequenced, and used to complement an Escherichia coli mutant. While def and fmt have been found sharing an operon in other organisms, the presence of a third gene within a putative operon has not previously been found.
TI  - Expression of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 genes in Escherichia coli for acetone production and acetate detoxification.
AB  - A synthetic acetone operon (ace4) composed of four Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 genes (adc, ctfAB, and thl, coding for the acetoacetate decarboxylase, coenzyme A transferase, and thiolase, respectively) under the control of the thl promoter was constructed and was introduced into Escherichia coli on vector pACT. Acetone production demonstrated that ace4 is expressed in E. coli and resulted in the reduction of acetic acid levels in the fermentation broth. Since different E. coli strains vary significantly in their growth characteristics and acetate metabolism, ace4 was expressed in three E. coli strains: ER2275, ATCC 11303, and MC1060. Shake flask cultures of MC1060(pACT) produced ca. 2 mM acetone, while both strains ER2275(pACT) and ATCC 11303(pACT) produced ca. 40 mM acetone. Glucose-fed cultures of strain ATCC 11303(pACT) resulted in a 150% increase in acetone titers compared to those of batch shake flask cultures. External addition of sodium acetate to glucose-fed cultures of ATCC 11303(pACT) resulted in further increased acetone titers. In bioreactor studies, acidic conditions (pH 5.5 versus 6.5) improved acetone production. Despite the substantial acetone evaporation due to aeration and agitation in the bioreactor, 125 to 154 mM acetone accumulated in ATCC 11303(pACT) fermentations. These acetone titers are equal to or higher than those produced by wild-type C. acetobutylicum. This is the first study to demonstrate the ability to use clostridial genes in nonclostridial hosts for solvent production. In addition, acetone-producing E. coli strains may be useful hosts for recombinant protein production in that detrimental acetate accumulation can be avoided.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of dnaK-operon proteins from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus.
AB  - We propose that the dnaK operon of Thermus thermophilus HB8 is composed of three  functionally linked genes: dnaK, grpE, and dnaJ. The dnaK and dnaJ gene products are most closely related to their cyanobacterial homologs. The DnaK protein sequence places T. thermophilus in the plastid Hsp70 subfamily. In contrast, the grpE translated sequence is most similar to GrpE from Clostridium acetobutylicum, a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. A single promoter region, with homology to the Escherichia coli consensus promoter sequences recognized by the sigma70 and sigma32 transcription factors, precedes the postulated operon. This promoter is heat-shock inducible. The dnaK mRNA level increased more than 30 times upon 10 min of heat shock (from 70 degrees C to 85 degrees C). A strong transcription terminating sequence was found between the dnaK and grpE genes. The individual genes were cloned into pET expression vectors and the thermophilic proteins were overproduced at high levels in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant T. thermophilus DnaK protein was shown to have a weak ATP-hydrolytic activity, with an optimum at 90 degrees C. The ATPase was stimulated by the presence of GrpE and DnaJ. Another open reading frame, coding for ClpB heat-shock protein, was found downstream of the dnaK operon.
TI  - Analysis of the Bacillus subtilis genome: cloning and nucleotide sequence of a 62 kb region between 275 degrees (rrnB) and 284 degrees (pai).
AB  - In the framework of the international project aimed at the sequencing of the Bacillus subtilis genome, five DNA fragments in the region between rrnB (275 degrees) and pai (284 degrees) were cloned by inverse and combinatorial long-range PCR and their nucleotide sequences were determined and analysed. Together these sequences constituted a contig of 62229 bp. On the basis of the position of Not1 and Stil restriction sites, the orientation and order of known genetic markers was determined to be pai (284 degrees)-degQ comQ comP comAA comAB-pbpD-kapB kinB patB-mcpB tipA mcpA tipB-rrnB (275 degrees). Fifty-four ORFs were detected. Thirteen of these coincided with known B. subtilis genes, and 41 new ORFs were found. Of the predicted new gene products, 12 showed no significant similarity to other known proteins, whereas ten showed strong similarity to proteins of other organisms with unknown function. Nineteen predicted proteins showed strong similarity to known proteins of other organisms, for instance a Na+/H+ antiporter system of Bacillus alcalophilus, a sugar transport system found in Mycoplasma genitalium, NADH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase A of B, subtilis, exo-1,4-alpha-glucosidase activity of Bacillus stearothermophilus and L-rhamnose isomerase of Escherichia coli.
TI  - The kdp system of Clostridium acetobutylicum: cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional regulation in response to potassium concentration.
AB  - The complete sequence of the kdp gene region of Clostridium acetobutylicum has been determined. This part of the chromosome comprises two small open reading frames (orfZ and orfY), putatively encoding hydrophobic peptides, and the genes kdpA, kdpB, kdpC, and kdpX, followed by an operon encoding a pair of sensor-effector regulatory proteins (KdpD and KdpE). Except for orfZ, orfY, and kdpX, all genes showed significant homology to the kdp genes of Escherichia coli, encoding a high-affinity potassium transport ATPase and its regulators. The complete genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 and a recently published part of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate the existence of a kdp system in these organisms as well, but all three systems comprise neither a second orf upstream of kdpA nor an additional kdpX gene. Expression of the clostridial kdp genes, including the unique kdpX gene, was found to be inducible by low potassium concentrations. A transcription start point could be mapped upstream of orfZ. A promoter upstream of kdpD was active only under noninducing conditions. Lowering the potassium content of the medium led to formation of a common transcript (orfZYkdpABCXDE), with a putative internal RNase E recognition site, which could be responsible for the instability of the common transcript. Except for the two small peptides, all gene products could be detected in in vitro transcription-translation experiments.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional analysis of groES and groEL genes from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The groESL operon from Clostridium thermocellum (Ct) has been isolated and sequenced, revealing two ORFs of 285 and 1626 nt, separated by 48 nt. The first ORF encoded a 94-aa 10.6-kDa GroES homologue; the second encoded a 541-aa polypeptide of 57.6 kDa, that exhibited 61% and 77% sequence identity with GroEL from Escherichia coli (Ec) and Clostridium acetobutylicum (Ca), respectively. A putative tsp, preceded by -10 and -35 consensus promoters, was identified upstream of groES. This was followed by an inverted repeat observed previously in bacterial heat shock genes. A 15-nt palindrome characteristic of a Rho-independent transcription terminator, was located downstream of groEL. The first nt of the groES translational start codon was preceded (7 nt) by a putative RBS (AGGAGG); a second RBS sequence was located 8 nt upstream of the groEL start. Production of GroE homologues by Ct was constitutive, but was enhanced significantly during a temperature upshift from 60 degrees C to 70 degrees C. The Ct GroEL, expressed in Ec as a fusion protein with GST, was purified, free of contaminating Ec GroEL.
TI  - Characterization of engF, a gene for a non-cellulosomal Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanase.
AB  - A new Clostridium cellulovorans (strain ATCC 35296) endoglucanase gene engF has been isolated and sequenced. The gene contains 1671 bp and codes for a protein containing 557 amino acids and a mass of 60.1 kDa. A putative signal peptide of 29 amino acids is present and the mature protein has a mass of 57.1 kDa. EngF does not have amino acid sequence homology to previously isolated EngB and EngD, but does show sequence homology to family 5 glycosyl hydrolases from Bacillus, Erwinia carotovora, and C. acetobutylicum species. EngF is not a component of the cellulosome and does not contain a duplicated sequence (DS) at its C-terminal region. EngF is capable of binding to cellulose and hydrolyzing carboxymethylcellulose but not xylan. The cellulose binding domain (CBD) differs from types I, II and III CBDs and no obvious homology has been found to other CBD types. The maximum activity of EngF occurs at pH 5.5 and at 47 degrees C. Its properties suggest that EngF plays an ancillary role in the degradation of cellulosic materials.
TI  - Transcriptional organization and regulation of the dnaK and groE operons of Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - The transcriptional organization and regulation of the dnaK and groE heat shock operons of Chlamydia trachomatis were studied and found to resemble those of the cognate operons of Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The gene order is conserved (hrcA-grpE-dnaK), but no dnaJ homolog could be identified in this region. The dnaK operon was transcribed as a low-abundance polycistronic mRNA whose levels did not increase upon exposure to heat shock. In contrast, a more abundant 2.3-kb mRNA encoding only the dnaK sequence was detectable, and its steady-state level increased upon heat shock. The transcription initiation sites of the dnaK and groE operons were found to be preceded by sequences that resemble an Escherichia coli sigma70 consensus promoter. Upstream of each putative promoter is an inverted repeat sequence which resembles a similar element (CIRCE [controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression]) found upstream of the dnaK and groE operons in at least 27 eubacterial species. In vitro transcription studies utilizing partially purified C. trachomatis RNA polymerase demonstrated that the regions containing the putative promoter elements of the dnaK and groE operons are functional, although heat shock-regulated expression could not be demonstrated.

TI  - Genetic manipulation of acid formation pathways by gene inactivation in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Integrational plasmid technology has been used to disrupt metabolic pathways leading to acetate and butyrate formation in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Non-replicative plasmid constructs, containing either clostridial phosphotransacetylase (pta) or butyrate kinase (buk) gene fragments, were integrated into homologous regions on the chromosome. Integration was assumed to occur by a Campbell-like mechanism, inactivating either pta or buk. Inactivation of the pta gene reduced phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase activity and significantly decreased acetate production. Inactivation of the buk gene reduced butyrate kinase activity, significantly decreased butyrate production and increased butanol production.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of genes encoding phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The enzymes phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and acetate kinase (AK) catalyze the conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to acetate in the fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum. The acetate-producing step is an important element in the acidogenic fermentation stage and generates ATP for clostridial cell growth. The genes pta and ack, encoding PTA and AK, respectively, were cloned and sequenced. Enzyme activity assays were performed on cell extracts from Escherichia coli and C. acetobutylicum harboring the subclone, and both AK and PTA activities were shown to be elevated. DNA sequence analysis showed that the pta and ack genes are adjacent in the clostridial chromosome, with pta upstream. The pta gene encodes a protein of 333 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 36.2 kDa, and ack encodes a polypeptide of 401 residues with a molecular mass of 44.3 kDa. Primer extension analysis identified a single transcriptional start site located 70 bp upstream of the start codon for the pta gene, suggesting an operon arrangement for these tandem genes. The results from overexpression of ack and pta in C. acetobutylicum showed that the final ratios of acetate to other major products were higher and that there was a greater proportion of two- versus four-carbon-derived products.
TI  - The effect of novobiocin on solvent production by Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Cells of Clostridium acetobutylicum treated with novoblocin, a DNA gyrase inhibitor, produced higher butyrate levels and lower solvent levels with acetone being the most affected. Seven enzyme activities involved in acid and solvent production were analyzed. Among them, only CoA transferase, required for acetone formation and acid uptake, experienced a significant decrease in activity. As in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, DNA from C. acetobutylicum became less negatively supercoiled in the early stationary phase (solventogenic stage), as shown by analysis of linking number of a reporter plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of chloroquine.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of clustered genes encoding beta-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, crotonase, and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The enzymes beta-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (BHBD), crotonase, and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD) from Clostridium acetobutylicum are responsible for the formation of butyryl-CoA from acetoacetyl-CoA. These enzymes are essential to both acid formation and solvent formation by clostridia. Clustered genes encoding BHBD, crotonase, BCD, and putative electron transfer flavoprotein alpha and beta subunits have been cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the crt gene indicates that it encodes crotonase, a protein with 261 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 28.2 kDa; the hbd gene encodes BHBD, with 282 residues and a molecular mass of 30.5 kDa. Three open reading frames (bcd, etfB, and etfA) are located between crt and hbd. The nucleotide sequence of bcd indicates that it encodes BCD, which consists of 379 amino acid residues and has high levels of homology with various acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Open reading frames etfB and etfA, located downstream of bcd, encode 27.2- and 36.1-kDa proteins, respectively, and show homology with the fixAB genes and the alpha and beta subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein. These findings suggest that BCD in clostridia might interact with the electron transfer flavoprotein in its redox function. Primer extension analysis identified a promoter consensus sequence upstream of the crt gene, suggesting that the clustered genes are transcribed as a transcriptional unit and form a BCS (butyryl-CoA synthesis) operon. A DNA fragment containing the entire BCS operon was subcloned into an Escherichia coli-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vector. Enzyme activity assays showed that crotonase and BHBD were highly overproduced in cell extracts from E. coli harboring the subclone. In C. acetobutylicum harboring the subclone, the activities of the enzymes crotonase, BHBD, and BCD were elevated.
TI  - Recombination-induced variants of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 with increased solvent production.
AB  - Three sporulation-specific genes (orfA, sigE, sigG) from clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 are arranged in a cluster, encoding the putative sigma E-processing enzyme, sigma E, and sigma sigma G respectively. When they were transformed into Clostridium acetobutylicum while on a plasmid functional in this organism, transformants did not survive. Three kinds of recombinations were then attempted with nonreplicative plasmids: duplication of orfA and sigE, replacement of all of the three genes, and inactivation of orfA. While the wild-type strain ceased to grow and produce solvents in batch cultures after approximately 24 h, mutant strains were isolated that showed sustained growth for a much longer time and produced a threefold increase in acetone and butanol in test tube cultures. In addition, one of the derived strains showed a significantly higher growth rate. Features of the restriction maps of the recombinants did not correlate with expected maps, indicating possible complications occurring during the recombination events.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the anaerobic succinate degradation pathway in Clostridium  kluyveri.
AB  - A region of genomic DNA from Clostridium kluyveri was cloned in Escherichia coli  by a screening strategy which was based on heterologous expression of the clostridial 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase gene. The gene region (6,575 bp) contained several open reading frames which encoded the coenzyme A (CoA)- and NADP+-dependent succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (sucD), the 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (4hbD), and a succinyl-CoA;CoA transferase (cat1), as analyzed by heterologous expression in E. coli. An open reading frame encoding a putative membrane protein (orfY) and the 5' region of a gene encoding a sigma 54-homologous sigma factor (sigL) were identified as well. Transcription was investigated by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. Protein sequence comparisons of SucD and 4HbD revealed similarities to the adhE (aad) gene products from E. coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum and to enzymes of the novel class (III) of alcohol dehydrogenases. A comparison of CoA-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases is presented.
TI  - Chemotherapeutic tumour targeting using clostridial spores.
AB  - The toxicity associated with conventional cancer chemotherapy is primarily due to a lack of specificity for tumour cells. In contrast, intravenously injected clostridial spores exhibit a remarkable specificity for tumours. This is because, following their administration, clostridial spores become exclusively localised to, and germinate in, the hypoxic/necrotic tissue of tumours. This unique property could be exploited to deliver therapeutic agents to tumours. In particular, genetic engineering could be used to endow a suitable clostridial host with the capacity to produce an enzyme within the tumour which can metabolise a systemically introduced, non-toxic prodrug into a toxic metabolite. The feasibility of this strategy (clostridial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, CDEPT) has been demonstrated by cloning the Escherichia coli B gene encoding nitroreductase (an enzyme which converts the prodrug CB1954 to a highly toxic bifunctional alkylating agent) into a clostridial expression vector and introducing the resultant plasmid into Clostridium beijerinckii (formerly C. acetobutylicum) NCIMB 8052. The gene was efficiently expressed, with recombinant nitroreductase representing 8% of the cell soluble protein. Following the intravenous injection of the recombinant spores into mice, tumour lysates have been shown, by Western blots, to contain the E. coli-derived enzyme.
TI  - Expression of heat shock genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Characterization of the heat shock response in Clostridium acetobutylicum has indicated that at least 15 proteins are induced by a temperature upshift from 30 to 42 degrees C. These so-called heat shock proteins include DnaK and GroEL, two highly conserved molecular chaperones. Several genes encoding heat shock proteins of C. acetobutylicum have been cloned and analysed. The dnaK operon includes the genes orfA (a heat shock gene with an unknown function), grpE, dnaK, and dnaJ; and the groE operon the genes groES and groEL. The hsp18 gene coding for a member of the small heat shock protein family constitutes a monocistronic operon. Interestingly, the heat shock response in this bacterium is regulated by a mechanism, which is obviously different from that found in Escherichia coli. So far, no evidence for a heat shock-specific sigma factor of the RNA polymerase in C. acetobutylicum has been found. In this bacterium, like in many Gram-positive and several Gram-negative bacteria, a conserved inverted repeat is located upstream of chaperone/chaperonin-encoding stress genes such as dnaK and groEL and may be implicated as a cis-acting regulatory site. The inverted repeat is not present in the promoter region of hsp18. Therefore, in C. acetobutylicum there are at least two classes of heat shock genes with respect to the type of regulation. Evidence has been found that a repressor is involved in the regulation of the heat shock response in C. acetobutylicum. However, this regulation seems to be independent of the inverted repeat motif, and the mechanism by which the inverted repeat motif mediates regulation remains to be elucidated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Taxonomy and phylogeny of industrial solvent-producing clostridia.
AB  - We performed a systematic study of 55 solvent-producing clostridial strains, the  majority of which are currently classified as Clostridium acetobutylicum strains, by using a combination of biotyping and DNA fingerprint analysis. The biotyping procedures used included rifampin susceptibility testing, bacteriocin typing, and bacteriophage typing. The 55 strains examined exhibited a good correlation between their biotypes and DNA fingerprints, which allowed us to divide them into nine groups. The DNA fingerprints of the nine groups differed markedly, but within each group the DNA fingerprints exhibited a high level of similarity. To determine the phylogenetic relationships of the nine groups, we performed a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The results of a comparative analysis of the partial sequence corresponding to positions 830 to 1383 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that the nine biotype groups could be assembled into four taxonomic groups. The complete 16S rRNA sequences of strains representing these groups were determined. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amylolytic type strain C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (taxonomic group I) was only distantly related to the saccharolytic strains belonging to taxonomic groups II, III, and IV (levels of sequence similarity, 90 to 90.5%). The strains belonging to taxonomic groups II, III, and IV, represented by C. acetobutylicum NCP 262, "Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum" N1-4, and C. acetobutylicum NCIMB 8052T (T = type strain), respectively, were closely related (levels of sequence similarity, 98.2 to 98.9%). C. acetobutylicum NCIMB 8052T exhibited a level of similarity of 100% with the type strain of Clostridium beijerinckii. Reclassification of the saccharolytic solvent-producing strains is necessary, and possible names for the four taxonomic groups are discussed.
TI  - A Clostridium acetobutylicum regulator gene (regA) affecting amylase production in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Plasmid pMET7C containing a 6.05 kb DNA insert from Clostridium acetobutylicum P262 made Escherichia coli F19 cells sensitive to metronidazole. The nucleotide sequence of the C. acetobutylicum DNA controlling metronidazole sensitivity in E. coli F19 revealed an ORF of 972 bp which encoded a protein of 324 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 35,000. The amino acid sequence encoded by the ORF contained a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and was homologous to the catabolite control protein, CcpA, from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium, a tRNA repressor of E. coli encoded by the shl gene, and the GalR, Lacl and PurR repressors of E. coli. The C. acetobutylicum ORF, which was termed regA, complemented a B. subtilis ccpA mutant and an E. coli shl mutant, but was unable to complement E. coli galR, lacl or purR mutants. To determine whether the regA gene product was involved in the regulation of amylase gene expression in C. acetobutylicum, a starch-degrading enzyme gene (staA) from C. acetobutylicum NCIMB 8052 was cloned. The RegA protein inhibited the degradation of starch by the C. acetobutylicum staA gene product in E. coli.
TI  - Characterization of an acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (thiolase) gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Thiolase (Thl) is an important enzyme at the junction in the pathway leading to the production of either acids (acetate or butyrate) or solvents (acetone, butanol or ethanol) during the growth of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Cloning and expression of the Thl-encoding gene (thl) has been described [Petersen and Bennett, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 57 (1991) 2735-2741], as has the purification and properties of the enzyme [Wiesenborn et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54 (1988) 2717-2722]. Here, we present the complete nucleotide sequence (1.9 kb) of thl. The gene encodes a protein of 392 amino acids (aa) (41,237 Da), which mass is in agreement with previous findings using the purified protein. Primer extension analysis has defined the promoter region, and a stem-loop structure found at the end of thl indicates that it is not part of an operon. The aa sequence of Thl showed homology to those of four other beta-ketothiolases: (i) PhbC of Alcaligenes eutrophus, (ii) PhbA of Chromatium vinosum, (iii) PhbA of Thiocystis violacea and (iv) PhbA of Zoogloea ramigera. The C terminus of an open reading frame found upstream from the Thl sequence is similar to OrfX of Bacillus subtilis and to NfrC of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052 cspA gene.
AB  - The major secreted protein of Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052, a choline-containing strain, is CspA (clostridial secreted protein). It appears to be a 115,000-M(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues of the cell wall. Polyclonal antibodies raised against CspA detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. The soluble CspA protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined N-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspA gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an M(r) of 63,740. According to the predicted amino acid sequence, CspA is synthesized with an N-terminal segment of 26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. Expression of the cspA gene in Escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-CspA-labeled protein of 80,000 Da which was purified by affinity chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. A comparison of CspA with other proteins in the EMBL database revealed that the C-terminal half of CspA is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (LytA amidase), the pneumococcal antigen PspA, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. This region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of Clostridium difficile.
TI  - Structure and transcription of genes within the beta-hbd-adh1 region of Clostridium acetobutylicum P262.
AB  - The 1.2-kb DNA fragment upstream of the linked beta-hbd (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase) and adh1 (NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase) genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum P262 was sequenced. The upstream region contained an open reading frame (ORFB) which was found to have 44% amino acid identity to the fixB gene products of Rhizobium and Azorhizobium. The beta-hbd and ORFB genes were expressed during the acidogenic and solventogenic phases. The beta-hbd gene was transcribed on a single mRNA species of 2.0 kb, whereas the ORFB gene was transcribed on two species of mRNA of 2.0 and 3.5 kb, respectively. The adh1 gene was induced or derepressed at the pH breakpoint before the onset of solventogenesis and was transcribed on a single species of mRNA of 2.4 kb.
TI  - Cyclic AMP in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An examination of cAMP levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. Cellular cAMP concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 and D, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. The results were compared to those for Escherichia coli NRRL B3704. The levels of cAMP ranged from undetectable for B. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for P. ruminicola D31d. Varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of cAMP in these organisms. In general, cAMP concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for E. coli. The levels of cAMP in P. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. Based on these data it seems unlikely that cAMP is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in P. ruminicola where it may have an unknown regulatory function.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanase gene, engB.
AB  - An endoglucanase gene, which was shown to be identical to the previously sequenced engB gene [Attwood et al. (1993) Abstr. Ann. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol.], was isolated from a Clostridium cellulovorans genomic library. Because of the lack of transcriptional information concerning engB we examined its expression in C. cellulovorans and in the heterologous hosts Escherichia coli and C. acetobutylicum following transformation of engB. Northern analysis suggested that both E. coli and C. acetobutylicum produced several transcripts of various sizes. C. cellulovarans produced a single transcript of 1600 bp with the relative amount of engB mRNA from cellulose-grown cells being much greater than that from cellobiose-grown cells. Primer extensions showed that engB was transcribed from a single transcription initiation site in C. cellulovorans preceded by sequences similar to promoter sequences found in Gram-positive bacteria. Primer extensions from both E. coli and C. acetobutylicum strains containing the engB gene showed multiple transcription initiation sites, none of which corresponded to the site determined in C. cellulovorans. We conclude that transcriptional control of the engB gene is less stringent in heterologous backgrounds and postulate that expression of the engB gene in C. cellulovorans is increased in the presence of cellulose.
TI  - Purification and molecular characterization of the NAD(+)-dependent acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase from Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - A bifunctional 95 kDa polypeptide (EhADH2) harbouring acetaldehyde dehydrogenase  and alcohol dehydrogenase activities was purified to homogeneity from trophozoite extracts of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Kinetic studies revealed that the enzyme utilizes NAD+ rather than NADP+ as cofactor. Km values for acetyl-CoA, acetaldehyde and ethanol were found to be 0.015, 0.15 and 80 mM respectively in the presence of 0.2 mM NAD+. The primary structure of EhADH2 as deduced from respective amoebic DNA sequences showed striking similarity to the trifunctional AdhE protein of Escherichia coli and the bifunctional AAD protein of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Alignment with a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases and alcohol dehydrogenases from various species suggested that the two catalytic functions of EhADH2 are located on separate parts of the molecule. By cross-linking experiments and electron-microscopic analysis, native EhADH2 was found to be organized in a homopolymeric fashion consisting of more than 20 associated promoters which form rods about 50-120 nm in length.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the beta-galactosidase gene from Enterobacter cloacae GAO.
AB  - The gene encoding a beta-galactosidase from Enterobacter cloacae GAO was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the insert of a positive clone had an open reading frame of 3084 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 1028 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 116,677 daltons. The amino acid sequence of beta-galactosidase deduced from the nucleotide sequence, especially the sequence around the putative active site and of the fourteen regions, showed significant homology to beta-galactosidases of other microorganisms, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a chromosomal fragment from Clostridium acetobutylicum  strain ABKn8 conferring chemical-damaging agents and UV resistance to E. coli recA strains.
AB  - A 3.3-kb DNA fragment of Clostridium acetobutylicum conferred methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), mitomycin C (MC), and UV resistance to recA strains of E. coli when cloned on the pUC19 plasmid. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the total insert and results of in vitro transcription-translation experiments showed that the insert directed the synthesis of three polypeptides referred to as ORFa, ORFb, and ORFc of 23.6, 15.3, and 21 kDa, respectively. None of the polypeptides presented a relationship with the RecA protein of E. coli or products of genes involved in the SOS response. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORFb and ORFc are highly homologous to those deduced from two genes specifying resistance to tellurium salts present on plasmid pMER610 harbored by Alcaligenes sp.strains and to an AMP-binding protein (CABP1) found in Dictyostelium discoideum. The existence of these homologous proteins suggests that they may perform a similar key function in the three unrelated organisms.
TI  - Identification of a grpE heat-shock gene homolog in the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei.
AB  - A grpE heat-shock gene was found by sequencing in the genome of the methanogenic  archaeon Methanosarcina mazei S-6. It is the first example of grpE from the phylogenetic domain Archaea. Since the other seven sequenced homologs are from the domain Bacteria, it may be concluded that grpE appeared early in evolution, before the two domains separated. The archaeal grpE is located in the dnaK locus, 431 base-pairs upstream of dnaK, which is followed downstream by the dnaJ gene. The organization of these three genes is known for Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Borrelia burgdorferi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The archaeal locus organization, grpE-dnaK-dnaJ, is similar to that of the former three bacteria, but different from that of M. tuberculosis. This, and sequence homologies, suggest that the M. tuberculosis GrpE belongs, together with the Streptomyces coelicolor homolog, to a subgroup of the GrpE proteins. The M. mazei grpE gene encodes a protein of 209 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 28.2 to 34.6% identities, and 50.3 to 58.9 similarities (identities plus conservative substitutions) with the other six complete GrpE sequences available. These percentages fall within the range observed for the other GrpEs. Two regions in the second and fourth quarters of the GrpE molecule show higher homology, particularly in three stretches of nine, six and nine amino acid residues, respectively. The archaeal gene uses all codons but three, whereas the bacterial homologs lack higher numbers of codons. The M. mazei grpE responded to heat-shock by increasing transcription, in a manner similar to that of the nearby heat-shock gene dnaK.
TI  - Studies of recombinant Clostridium acetobutylicum with increased dosages of butyrate formation genes.
AB  
TI  - Salmonella typhimurium loci involved in survival within macrophages.
AB  - A set of Tn10 mutants of Salmonella typhimurium which have a diminished capacity  to survive in murine macrophages and decreased virulence in mice has been described previously. In this study, we characterized 30 of these mutants and determined map locations of Tn10 insertions for 23 of these strains. In addition, short fragments of transposon-flanking DNA were cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was determined for 23 mutants. Seven mutants carried transposon insertions in known genes, representing six loci: htrA, prc, purD, fliD, nagA, and smpB. The possible roles of these genes in Salmonella virulence are discussed. One insertion was found to be in an unknown gene which shared homology with the open reading frames Bv' and Bv located in the pin inversion system of Shigella boydii. In one mutant, Tn10 was found to be inserted in a gene with significant homology to adhE of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The map location and degree of homology indicate that the Salmonella gene encodes a related, but different, dehydrogenase. In 14 of the mutants analyzed, Tn10 was inserted into genes which had no significant homologies to entries in the DNA and protein data bases. In conclusion, 16 insertions define loci, termed ims for impaired macrophage survival, which have not yet been described in S. typhimurium but have been shown previously to be necessary for full virulence in mice. Although most ims loci are distributed randomly throughout the genome, a cluster was found between 75 and 78 min on the Salmonella chromosome.
TI  - Molecular characterization of an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - A gene (aad) coding for an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AAD) was identified immediately upstream of the previously cloned ctfA (J. W. Cary, D. J. Petersen, E. T. Papoutsakis, and G. N. Bennett, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 56:1576-1583, 1990) of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and sequenced. The 2,619-bp aad codes for a 96,517-Da protein. Primer extension analysis identified two transcriptional start sites 83 and 243 bp upstream of the aad start codon. The N-terminal section of AAD shows homology to aldehyde dehydrogenases of bacterial, fungal, mammalian, and plant origin, while the C-terminal section shows homology to alcohol dehydrogenases of bacterial (which includes three clostridial alcohol dehydrogenases) and yeast origin. AAD exhibits considerable amino acid homology (56% identity) over its entire sequence to the trifunctional protein encoded by adhE from Escherichia coli. Expression of aad from a plasmid in C. acetobutylicum showed that AAD, which appears as a approximately 96-kDa band in denaturing protein gels, provides elevated activities of NADH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase, NAD-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, and a small increase in NADH-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase. A 957-bp open reading frame that could potentially encode a 36,704-Da protein was identified upstream of aad.
TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Heterologous expression of endo-beta-1,4-D-glucanase from Clostridium cellulovorans in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 following transformation of the engB gene.
AB  - Heterologous expression of the Clostridium cellulovorans engB gene by Clostridium acetobutylicum BKW-1 was detected as zones of hydrolysis on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) Trypticase glucose yeast plates stained with Congo red. The extracellular cellulase preparation from C. acetobutylicum BKW-1 has a specific activity towards CMC which is more than fourfold that present in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis using the C. cellulovorans anti-EngB primary antibody demonstrated that an additional 44-kDa protein band was present in the supernatant derived from C. acetobutylicum BKW-1 but was not present in ATCC 824 or ATCC 824(pMTL500E).
TI  - The xynC gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 codes for a xylanase with two similar catalytic domains.
AB  - The xynC gene of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 codes for a 66.4-kDa xylanase which consists of three distinct domains separated by two flexible regions rich in serine residues. Domains A and B of XynC code for catalytic domains with 56.5% identity and 9.6% similarity with each other, and both domains share homology with xylanases of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Neocallimastix patriciarum, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus circulans. More than 88% of the xylanase activity of Escherichia coli cells carrying the original 13-kb recombinant plasmid was released from intact cells by cold water washes. The major products of hydrolysis of xylan by both domains were xylose and xylobiose, indicating that the xynC gene product exhibits catalytic properties similar to those of the XynA xylanases from R. flavefaciens and N. patriciarum. So far, these features are not shared broadly with bacteria from other environments and may indicate specific selection for this domain structure in the highly competitive environment of the rumen.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the dnaK gene region of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - A 5.4 kb HindIII fragment of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was identified using a homologous dnaK probe generated by PCR and cloned in Escherichia coli. Upstream sequences were generated by inverse PCR. The two cloned fragments partially overlapped, and sequencing of 5915 bp revealed the presence of four open reading frames in the order orf1-grpE-dnaK-orf4. orf1 encodes a 39 kDa protein of unknown function which shows considerable sequence homology with the Orf39 and Orfa proteins of Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum, respectively. The downstream ORFs showed high homology to the grpE and dnaK genes of other prokaryotes. The DnaK protein has a characteristic 24-amino-acid deletion exhibited by all the known DnaK proteins of Gram-positive species. In many bacteria the dnaK and dnaJ genes are found as part of the same operon. The L. lactis dnaK operon is unusual in that the dnaK gene is followed by a putative transcription terminator and a fourth large ORF which shares no homology with the dnaJ genes of other bacteria but has a small degree of homology with various membrane proteins. Vegetative promoter sequences are found upstream of both orf1 and orf4. A 12 bp inverted repeat is found upstream of the putative promoter of orf1 and an 8 bp inverted repeat is found between this promoter and the orf1 initiation codon. These repeats are thought to be involved in regulation of the heat-shock genes. The DnaK homologue is induced approximately 3-fold on heat shock at 42 degrees C.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence and structural analysis of the Clostridium acetobutylicum dnaJ gene.
AB  - The complete dnaJ gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum was isolated by chromosome walking using the previously cloned 5' end of the gene as a probe. Nucleotide sequencing of a positively reacting 2.2-kb HincII fragment, contained in the recombinant plasmid pKG4, revealed that the reading frame of the dnaJ gene of C. acetobutylicum consists of 1125 bp, encoding a protein of 374 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 40376 and an isoelectric point of 9.54. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to the DnaJ proteins of other bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis) as well as of an archaeon (Methanosarcina mazei) and to the corresponding proteins of eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens). The areas of similarity included a conserved N-terminal domain of about 70 amino acids, a glycine-rich region of about 30 residues, and a central domain containing four repeats of a CXXCXGXG motif, whereas the C-terminal domain was less conserved. Northern (RNA) blot analysis indicated that dnaJ is induced by heat shock and that it is part of the dnaK operon of C. acetobutylicum. The 5' end (901 bp) of another gene (orfB), downstream of dnaJ and not heat-inducible, showed no significant similarity to other sequences available in EMBL and GenBank databases.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and molecular analysis of the sol operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum, a chromosomal locus involved in solventogenesis.
AB  - A DNA region of Clostridium acetobutylicum contiguous with the adc operon has been cloned and sequenced. Structural genes encoding the acetoacetyl coenzyme A:acetate/butyrate:coenzyme A transferase (ctfB and ctfA) and an alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhE) could be identified. These three genes together with a small open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function (upstream of adhE) formed an operon (sol operon), as shown by mRNA analyses. The complete sol operon was transcriptionally induced or derepressed before the onset of solventogenesis, thus confirming earlier results of Northern hybridizations with a ctfB gene probe (U. Gerischer and P. Durre, J. Bacteriol. 174:426-433, 1992). Upstream of the sol operon, we identified two putative promoters that were located in regions with possible stem-loop structures formed by several inverted repeats. The distal promoter P1 showed only minor transcription initiation in solventogenic C. acetobutylicum cells but was recognized in Escherichia coli, presumably because of its high similarity to the sigma 70 consensus sequence. The adhE-proximal promoter P2 directed the major transcription start point in solventogenic C. acetobutylicum but was not recognized in E. coli. The clostridial AdhE showed high similarity to a novel family (type III) of alcohol dehydrogenases. Two other ORFs (ORF 5 and ORF 6) were found on the cloned DNA region that showed no significant similarity to sequences in various available data bases. mRNA studies revealed that ORF 5 formed a monocistronic operon and showed increased expression before onset of solventogenesis.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the genes encoding phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIMB 8052.
AB  - An 8.1-kb fragment of chromosomal DNA from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIMB 8052  (formerly NCIB 8052) has been cloned into plasmid pAT153 and shown to allow the growth of Escherichia coli LJ32 (F+ atoC2c atoD32 fadR) on butyrate as the sole source of carbon and energy. Deletion analysis delineated a 3.9-kb subfragment capable of complementation. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and it was shown to encode three complete, and two incomplete open reading frames (ORFs). Based on enzymic studies of recombinant clones, two of these ORFs were shown to encode phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase. The above enzymes are involved in the acidogenic phase of fermentation in C. acetobutylicum. The fragment also carries an incomplete ORF encoding a polypeptide exhibiting substantial similarity to dihydropteroate synthase.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a phage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid), pCAK1, containing the replicative form of viruslike particle CAK1 isolated from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444.
AB  - A bacteriophage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid) designated pCAK1 was constructed by ligating 5-kbp Escherichia coli plasmid pAK102 (AprEmr) and the 6.6-kbp HaeIII-linearized replicative form of the CAK1 viruslike particle from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444. Phagemid pCAK1 (11.6 kbp) replicated via the ColE1 replication origin derived from pAK102 in E. coli. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules complexed with protein in a manner which protected ssDNA from nucleases were recovered from the supernatant of E. coli DH11S transformants containing pCAK1 in the absence of cell lysis. This suggests that the viral-strand DNA synthesis replication origin of CAK1 and associated gene expression are functional in E. coli DH11S. The single-stranded form of pCAK1 isolated from E. coli supernatant was transformed into E. coli DH5 alpha' or DH11S by electroporation. Isolation of ampicillin-resistant E. coli transformants following transformation suggests that the complementary-strand DNA synthesis replication origin of CAK1 is also functional in E. coli. The coat proteins associated with ssDNA of pCAK1 demonstrated sensitivity to proteinase K and various solvents (i.e., phenol and chloroform), similar to the results obtained previously with CAK1. Following phagemid construction in E. coli, pCAK1 was transformed into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and C. perfringens 13 by intact cell electroporation. Restriction enzyme analysis of pCAK1 isolated from erythromycin-resistant transformants of both C. acetobutylicum and C. perfringens suggested that it was identical to that present in E. coli transformants.
TI  - Sequence and molecular characterization of a DNA region encoding a small heat shock protein of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - A DNA region of Clostridium acetobutylicum containing a gene (hsp 18) with significant homology to a family of small eukaryotic heat shock proteins was cloned and sequenced. It is the second reported sequence of a low-molecular-weight heat shock protein from gram-positive bacteria and is induced not only by heat shock but also at the onset of solventogenesis, as determined by Northern (RNA) blot analysis, thus confirming the results of an earlier study performed at the protein level (A. Pich, F. Narberhaus, and H. Bahl, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 33:697-704, 1990). By primer extension analysis, a transcriptional start site was identified 149 bp upstream of hsp18. This site was preceded by a region that exhibits high homology to the consensus promoter sequences of gram-positive bacteria, as well as sigma 70-dependent Escherichia coli. A direct repeat structure was detected in the -35 region. The promoter is located 196 bp from the start of a potential regulatory tRNA(Thr)ACG gene involved in the shift to solventogenesis which is transcribed in the opposite direction. A putative rho-independent transcription termination structure was identified at the 3' end of hsp18.
TI  - In vivo methylation in Escherichia coli by the Bacillus subtilis phage phi 3T I methyltransferase to protect plasmids from restriction upon transformation of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - The restriction endonuclease Cac824I has been shown to be a major barrier to electrotransformation of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (L. D. Mermelstein, N. E. Welker, G. N. Bennett, and E. T. Papoutsakis, Bio/Technology 10:190-195, 1992). Methylation by the phi 3T I methyltransferase encoded by Bacillus subtilis phage phi 3T was shown to protect plasmid DNA from restriction by Cac824I. Expression in Escherichia coli of the phi 3tI gene (which encodes the phi 3T I methyltransferase) from pAN1, which replicates via the p15A origin of replication, was sufficient to completely methylate coresident E. coli-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors with ColE1 origins of replication. Three shuttle vectors (pIMP1, pSYL2, and pSYL7) methylated in this manner were used to efficiently electrotransform strain ATCC 824. These vectors could not be introduced into strain ATCC 824 when unmethylated because the E. coli portions of the plasmids contain a large number of Cac824I sites. This method obviates the need to use B. subtilis-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors with few Cac824I sites to introduce DNA into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and regulatory analysis of the Lactococcus lactis dnaJ gene.
AB  - The dnaJ gene of Lactococcus lactis was isolated from a genomic library of L. lactis NIZO R5 and cloned into pUC19. Nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,137 bp in length, encoding a protein of 379 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to the DnaJ proteins of Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The level of the dnaJ monocistronic mRNA increased approximately threefold after heat shock. The transcription initiation site of the dnaJ gene was determined and appeared to be preceded by a typical gram-positive vegetative promoter sequence (TTGCCA-17 bp-TAAAAT). Upstream of the promoter region, an inverted repeat is located that is identical to those detected upstream of heat shock genes of other gram-positive organisms. A transcriptional fusion between the dnaJ expression signals and a usp45-amyS secretion cassette caused a significant increase in alpha-amylase activity after heat shock induction. Deletion mutagenesis showed that the inverted repeat is involved in heat shock regulation of the dnaJ gene. The conservation of this palindromic sequence in gram-positive heat shock genes suggests a common regulatory pathway distinct from the system used in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium stercorarium xynA gene encoding xylanase A: identification of catalytic and cellulose binding domains.
AB  - The nucleotides of the xynA gene of Clostridium stercorarium were sequenced. The  structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1533 bp encoding 511 amino acids with an M(r) of 56,519. The signal peptide cleavage site was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme produced by a recombinant Escherichia coli. Xylanase A consists of a catalytic domain belonging to family G at the N-terminus and two direct repeats of about 90 amino acids with a short spacing at the C-terminus. Deletion analysis showed that the repeated sequences were responsible for binding the enzyme to Avicel and were not essential for catalytic activity. The catalytic domain of this enzyme is highly homologous to xylanase A of Clostridium acetobutylicum (identity: 69%) and xylanase B of Bacillus pumilus (identity: 64%).
TI  - Cloning, structure, and expression of acid and solvent pathway genes of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  
TI  - A reporter gene vector to investigate the regulation of glutamine synthetase in Bacteroides fragilis Bf1.
AB  - The Clostridium acetobutylicum eglA gene, encoding a beta-1,4-endoglucanase (EG), was shown to be a useful reporter gene for the study of gene expression in Bacteroides fragilis. The eglA reporter gene has the advantages that it can be easily identified in both Escherichia coli and B. fragilis on agar media containing carboxymethylcellulose, and EG production can be rapidly quantified in liquid medium. Since the B. fragilis glutamine synthetase (GS) is inactivated in permeabilized cells and cell extracts, the eglA reporter gene was used to study the regulation of GS production in B. fragilis. Gene fusions containing the GS glnA promoter region fused to the promoterless eglA gene showed that glnA expression was regulated by nitrogen in B. fragilis at the transcriptional level. A glnA upstream region containing a near-perfect direct repeat sequence was essential for efficient GS expression and for regulation by nitrogen.
TI  - Differential expression of a Clostridium acetobutylicum antisense RNA: implications for regulation of glutamine synthetase.
AB  - The Clostridium acetobutylicum glutamine synthetase (GS) DNA region is characterized by a downstream promoter, P3, oriented toward the glnA gene, which controls the transcription of an RNA complementary to the start of the glnA mRNA. Expression of the predicted 43-base antisense RNA was demonstrated in C. acetobutylicum and Escherichia coli cells containing the cloned glnA DNA. Antisense RNA transcription from P3 was not regulated by nitrogen in E. coli cells, but the expression of antisense RNA was associated with decreased levels of GS activity. In C. acetobutylicum, GS activity and the transcription of glnA mRNA and antisense RNA were regulated by nitrogen. GS activity and glnA mRNA were repressed in cells grown in nitrogen-rich medium. Repression ratios for GS activity varied from 1.6 to 9.0, depending on the sampling time. The relative number of glnA transcripts was approximately 25% lower in cells grown for 72 h in nitrogen-rich medium than in cells grown in nitrogen-limiting medium. This finding contrasted with the expression of antisense RNA, which was repressed in nitrogen-limiting medium but induced in nitrogen-rich medium. The relative number of antisense RNA transcripts was increased approximately sixfold in cells grown in nitrogen-rich medium. There was a 1.6-fold excess of antisense RNA over glnA mRNA under conditions that repressed GS activity. Under conditions that induced GS activity, glnA mRNA transcripts exceeded antisense RNA transcripts by fivefold.
TI  - Molecular characterization of two Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 butanol dehydrogenase isozyme genes.
AB  - A 4-kb segment of DNA containing two previously cloned butanol dehydrogenase (BDH) isozyme genes (D. Petersen, R. Welch, F. Rudolph, and G. Bennett, J. Bacteriol. 173:1831-1834, 1991) was sequenced. Two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were identified (bdhA and bdhB), along with a third truncated ORF (ORF1). The translation products of bdhA and bdhB corresponded to the N-terminal sequences of the purified BDH I and BDH II proteins, respectively. The two isozymes had a high amino acid identity (73%) and showed homology to a newly described class of alcohol dehydrogenases. Northern blots revealed that bdhA and bdhB did not form an operon. Primer extension experiments located single transcriptional start sites 37 and 58 bp upstream of the start codons of bdhA and bdhB, respectively. The -10 and -35 promoter regions for these genes were almost identical. bdhA and bdhB were found to be induced or derepressed immediately prior to significant butanol production in controlled pH 5.0 batch fermentations.
TI  - Vector construction, transformation, and gene amplification in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - In order to alter the primary metabolism of C. acetobutylicum, we have constructed E. coli- or B. subtilis-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors that could be used to deliver homologous fermentative genes into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The plasmid copy number and plasmid stability in C. acetobutylicum for several of these plasmids were determined. We have also developed a protocol for the electrotransformation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Difficulty in the transformation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 with vectors containing DNA from E. coli plasmids was found to be due to the existence of a restriction system in this strain. This type II restriction endonuclease, named Cac824I, recognizes the sequence 5'-GCNGC-3' and cuts ColE1 plasmids frequently. One of the vectors, pFNK1, possessing a variety of unique cloning sites was used in the amplification of one acid (PTB) and one solvent (AADC) formation gene. The corresponding enzyme activities were amplified in C. acetobutylicum as shown by enzyme assays and SDS-PAGE gels of cell extracts.
TI  - Organization and nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase (glnA) gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - A 3.3-kb BamHI fragment of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA was cloned and sequenced. It complements an Escherichia coli glnA deletion strain and hybridizes strongly to a DNA containing the Bacillus subtilis glnA gene. DNA sequence analysis of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA showed it to contain the glnA gene encoding class I glutamine synthetase, as judged by extensive homology with other prokaryotic glnA genes. The sequence suggests that the enzyme encoded in this gene is not controlled by adenylylation. Based on a comparison of glutamine synthetase sequences, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is much closer to gram-positive eubacteria, especially Clostridium acetobutylicum, than to gram-negative eubacteria and archaebacteria. The fragment contains another open reading frame encoding a protein of unknown function consisting of 306 amino acids (ORF306), which is also present upstream of glnA of Bacillus cereus. In B. cereus, a repressor gene, glnR, is found between the open reading frame and glnA. Two proteins encoded by the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gene were identified by the maxicell method; the sizes of these proteins are consistent with those of the open reading frames of ORF306 and glnA. The lack of a glnR gene in the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA in this position may indicate a gene rearrangement or a different mechanism of glnA gene expression.
TI  - Reconstruction and expression of the autolytic gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The complete lyc gene encoding the autolytic lysozyme of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was reconstructed from two overlapping DNA fragments and cloned into a suitable plasmid enabling Escherichia coli to produce this lytic enzyme under the control of the lac promoter. A polypeptide with an apparent M(r) of 35,000, corresponding to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence, was observed by maxicell analysis of whole-cell extracts of E. coli harboring the clostridial gene. The enzyme yield was shown to depend on the pH of the culture medium, since the protein was unstable at alkaline pH. The expression of the lyc gene was not increased by using the E. coli strong promoter, lpp-lac, probably due to the limit imposed by the extreme differences in codon usage. Although the LYC lysozyme does not contain a cleavable signal peptide, most of the protein was found in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli suggesting that this enzyme was secreted through a specific mechanism, as already observed for other autolysins.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the dnaK gene region of Clostridium acetobutylicum, including grpE, dnaJ, and a new heat shock gene.
AB  - The dnaK gene region of Clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned in Escherichia coli by using the pBluescript SK+ and pUC18 vectors. By using the E. coli dnaK gene as a probe and by in vivo chromosome walking, three positive clones harboring the recombinant plasmids pKG1, pKG2, and pKG3 containing 1.2-kbp HindIII, 3.55-kbp EcoRV, and 1.2-kbp PstI fragments of the chromosome of C. acetobutylicum, respectively, were isolated. The cloned fragments partially overlapped, and together they spanned 4,083 bp of the clostridial genome that were completely sequenced. On one strand, four open reading frames of which the last was obviously truncated were identified. The last three genes showed high homology to the grpE, dnaK, and dnaJ heat shock genes of E. coli, respectively. They were preceded by an open reading frame (orfA) without any homology to sequences available in the EMBL or GenBank data bases. Typical translational start sites could be found in front of all four genes. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed transcripts of this region with a maximum length of 5.0 kb. Thus, these genes are probably organized in an operon. A transcription terminator could be found between the dnaK and dnaJ genes. By primer extension analysis, a major heat-inducible transcription start site was identified 49 bases upstream of orfA. This site was preceded by a region (5'-TTGACA[17 bp]TATTTT) that exhibited high homology to the consensus promoter sequences of gram-positive bacteria as well as sigma 70-dependent E. coli. Between this promoter and the initiation codon of orfA, a hairpin-loop structure with a possible regulatory role in the expression of these genes was found. Additional heat-inducible transcription start sites were located 69 bases upstream of orfA and 87 bases upstream of grpE; the corresponding promoter regions showed less similarity to other known promoter sequences. Maximum mRNA levels of this heat shock operon were found about 15 min after a heat shock from 30 to 42 degrees C. Our results indicate that orfA codes for an unknown heat shock protein.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and molecular analysis of the groESL operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The groESL operon of Clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned in Escherichia coli by using a gene probe of E. coli groESL. Sequencing of a positively reacting 2.2-kbp HindIII fragment contained in the recombinant plasmid pFN1 and a 2.5-kbp XbaI fragment present in pFN4 revealed that both fragments partially overlapped and together spanned 3,493 bp of the clostridial chromosome. Two complete open reading frames (288 and 1632 bp) were found and identified as the groES- and groEL-homologous genes of C. acetobutylicum, respectively. The 3' end of a third gene (orfZ), which was divergently transcribed, showed no significant homology to other sequences available in the EMBL and GenBank data bases. The length of the groESL-specific mRNA (2.2 kb), a transcription terminator downstream of groEL, and a transcription start site upstream of groES, identified by primer extension analysis, indicated that groES and groEL of C. acetobutylicum are organized in a bicistronic operon. From the transcription start site, the promoter structure 5'-TTGCTA (17 bp) TATTAT that shows high homology to the consensus promoter sequence of gram-positive bacteria as well as E. coli was deduced. Transcription of the groESL operon was strongly heat inducible, and maximum levels of mRNA were detected 15 min after heat shock from 30 to 42 degrees C. An 11-bp inverted repeat, located between promoter and translation start sites of groES and partially identical with similar structures in front of several heat shock genes of other bacteria, may play an important role in the regulation of heat shock gene expression in this organism.
TI  - Expression of cloned homologous fermentative genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum  ATCC 824.
AB  - We have previously cloned the acetone-formation pathway gene, encoding acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc), and butyrate-formation pathway gene, encoding phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb), of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in Escherichia coli. Here we report their subcloning in Bacillus subtilis and transfer to strain ATCC 824 via electrotransformation, where the corresponding enzyme activities were expressed at elevated levels, using pFNK1, a new B. subtilis/C. acetobutylicum shuttle vector. Plasmid pFNK1 was used because shuttle vectors that function in E. coli were unable to electrotransform ATCC 824 unless they became deleted in the E. coli-plasmid regions. The difficulties with shuttle vectors that function in E. coli are probably due to the presence of a restriction endonuclease in ATCC 824. This endonuclease recognizes the sequence 5'-GCNGC-3', which is prevalent in E. coli plasmids but occurs infrequently in pFNK1 and C. acetobutylicum genes. Cloning of genes in C. acetobutylicum is critical for redirecting the cellular metabolism (metabolic engineering) as well as for genetic studies of this industrial organism.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene from Bacillus stearothermophilus var. non-diastaticus encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase.
AB  - A 4.1-kb EcoRI fragment which includes the gene (gldA) encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase (G1DH; EC 1.1.1.6; glycerol:NAD oxidoreductase) from Bacillus stearothermophilus var. non-diastaticus has been cloned by virtue of its ability to restore glycerol utilisation to Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (glpK) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) mutants. Sequencing suggests that the gldA gene is likely to be monocistronic and encodes a protein of 39450 Da. The deduced amino acid composition and sequence of G1DH reveals that the protein is extremely similar to a characterized metal-dependent NAD-dependent G1DH from B. stearothermophilus RS93. The enzyme has limited homology to the iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase of Zymomonas mobilis and the butanol dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - mRNA analysis of the adc gene region of Clostridium acetobutylicum during the shift to solventogenesis.
AB  - By using primer extension analysis, we located the transcription start point of the acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc) gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum 90 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon with A as the first transcribed nucleotide. From this site the promoter structure TTTACT(18 bp)TATAAT was identified; it shows high homology to the consensus sequences of gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli. Northern blot experiments revealed a length of 850 bases for the transcript of the adc gene. It thus represents a monocistronic operon. Transcription of adc was induced by conditions necessary for the onset of solvent formation. Induction occurred long before the respective fermentation product (acetone) could be detected in the medium. Transcription of the operon containing the genes for acetoacetyl coenzyme A:acetate/butyrate:coenzyme A transferase (designated ctf) downstream of the adc gene but divergently transcribed is also induced by conditions necessary for the onset of solvent formation. The length of the respective RNA transcript, 4.1 kb, indicates additional coding capacity, since the genes for the two subunits of the coenzyme A transferase cover only approximately 1.5 kb. No distinct transcripts for the other open reading frames of the adc gene region, ORF1 and ORF2, could be detected. Computer analysis indicated that ORF1, which showed significant similarity to the alpha-amylase gene of Bacillus subtilis (U. Gerischer and P. Durre, J. Bacteriol. 172:6907-6918, 1990), probably is indeed a coding region. ORF2, however, does not seem to have a coding function.
TI  - The bacteriocin lactococcin A specifically increases permeability of lactococcal  cytoplasmic membranes in a voltage-independent, protein-mediated manner.
AB  - Lactococcin A is a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis. Its structural gene has recently been cloned and sequenced (M. J. van Belkum, B. J. Hayema, R. E. Jeeninga, J. Kok, and G. Venema, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 57:492-498, 1991). Purified lactococcin A increased the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane of L. lactis and dissipated the membrane potential. A significantly higher concentration of lactococcin A was needed to dissipate the membrane potential in an immune strain of L. lactis. Lactococcin A at low concentrations (0.029 microgram/mg of protein) inhibited secondary and phosphate-bond driven transport of amino acids in sensitive cells and caused efflux of preaccumulated amino acids. Accumulation of amino acids by immune cells was not affected by this concentration of lactococcin A. Lactococcin A also inhibited proton motive force-driven leucine uptake and leucine counterflow in membrane vesicles of the sensitive strain but not in membrane vesicles of the immune strain. These observations indicate that lactococcin A makes the membrane permeable for leucine in the presence or absence of a proton motive force and that the immunity factor(s) is membrane linked. Membrane vesicles of Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were not affected by lactococcin A, nor were liposomes derived from phospholipids of L. lactis. These results indicate that lactococcin A acts on the cytoplasmic membrane and is very specific towards lactococci. The combined results obtained with cells, vesicles, and liposomes suggest that the specificity of lactococcin A may be mediated by a receptor protein associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Properties of the glucose phosphotransferase system of Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052.
AB  - The glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) of Clostridium acetobutylicum was studied by using cell extracts. The system exhibited a Km for glucose of 34 microM, and glucose phosphorylation was inhibited competitively by mannose and 2-deoxyglucose. The analogs 3-O-methylglucoside and methyl alpha-glucoside did not inhibit glucose phosphorylation significantly. Activity showed no dependence on Mg2+ ions or on pH in the range 6.0 to 8.0. The PTS comprised both soluble and membrane-bound proteins, which interacted functionally with the PTSs of Clostridium pasteurianum, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. In addition to a membrane-bound enzyme IIGlc, sugar phosphorylation assays in heterologous systems incorporating extracts of pts mutants of other organisms provided evidence for enzyme I, HPr, and IIIGlc components. The HPr was found in the soluble fraction of C. acetobutylicum extracts, whereas enzyme I, and probably also IIIGlc, was present in both the soluble and membrane fractions, suggesting a membrane location in the intact cell.
TI  - Cloning of the Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (thiolase; EC 2.3.1.9) gene.
AB  - Thiolase (acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.9) from Clostridium acetobutylicum is a key enzyme in the production of acids and solvents in this organism. The purification and properties of the enzyme have already been described (D. P. Wiesenborn, F. B. Rudolph, and E.T. Papoutsakis, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54:2717-2722, 1988). The thl gene encoding the thiolase has been cloned by using primary antibodies raised to the purified enzyme. A bacteriophage lambda EMBL3 library of C. acetobutylicum DNA was prepared and screened by immunoblots with the antithiolase antibodies. Phage DNA was purified from positive plaques, and restriction enzyme digests identified an approximately 4.8-kb AccI fragment common to all positive plaques. A corresponding fragment was also found in AccI digests of C. acetobutylicum chromosomal DNA. The fragment was purified and EcoRI linkers were attached before being subcloned into pUC19. Maxicell analysis showed the production of an approximately 42-kDa protein, whose size corresponded to the molecular size of the purified thiolase, from the clostridial insert. Enzyme activity assays and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated whole-cell extracts of Escherichia coli harboring the cloned thl confirmed the presence of the thiolase encoded within the cloned DNA.
TI  - Expression and nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-galactosidase gene cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A gene library for Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 2951 was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR1, and cosmids containing the beta-galactosidase gene were isolated by direct selection for enzyme activity on X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside) plates after conjugal transfer of the library to a lac deletion derivative of Escherichia coli. Analysis of various pSUP202 subclones of the lac cosmids on X-Gal plates localized the beta-galactosidase gene to a 5.1-kb EcoRI fragment. Expression of the Clostridium beta-galactosidase gene in E. coli was not subject to glucose repression. By using transposon Tn5 mutagenesis, two gene loci, cbgA (locus I) and cbgR (locus II), were identified as necessary for beta-galactosidase expression in E. coli. DNA sequence analysis of the entire 5.1-kb fragment identified open reading frames of 2,691 and 303 bp, corresponding to locus I and locus II, respectively, and in addition a third truncated open reading frame of 825 bp. The predicted gene product of locus I, CbgA (molecular size, 105 kDa), showed extensive amino acid sequence homology with E. coli LacZ, E. coli EbgA, and Klebsiella pneumoniae LacZ and was in agreement with the size of a polypeptide synthesized in maxicells containing the cloned 5.1-kb fragment. The predicted gene product of locus II, CbgR (molecular size, 11 kDa) shares no significant homology with any other sequence in the current DNA and protein sequence data bases, but Tn5 insertions in this gene prevent the synthesis of CbgA. Complementation experiments indicate that the gene product of cbgR is required in cis with cbgA for expression of beta-galactosidase in E. coli.
TI  - Molecular cloning of an alcohol (butanol) dehydrogenase gene cluster from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - In Clostridium acetobutylicum, conversion of butyraldehyde to butanol is enzymatically achieved by butanol dehydrogenase (BDH). A C. acetobutylicum gene that encodes this protein was identified by using an oligonucleotide designed on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified C. acetobutylicum NADH-dependent BDH. Enzyme assays of cell extracts of Escherichia coli harboring the clostridial gene demonstrated 15-fold-higher NADH-dependent BDH activity than untransformed E. coli, as well as an additional NADPH-dependent BDH activity. Kinetic, sequence, and isoelectric focusing analyses suggest that the cloned clostridial DNA contains two or more distinct C. acetobutylicum enzymes with BDH activity.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 1731 has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. The purified enzyme was composed of four subunits and had a molecular mass of 370,000 Da. Western immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against the sigma 70 subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase identified the 46,000-Da subunit as an immunologically and probably functionally related protein. The other three subunits of 128,000, 117,000, and 42,000 Da are tentatively analogous to the beta, beta', and alpha subunits, respectively, of other eubacterial RNA polymerases. The RNA polymerase activity was completely dependent on Mg2+, nucleoside triphosphates, and a DNA template. The presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ in buffers used for purification or storage caused irreversible inactivation of the RNA polymerase.
TI  - Electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1.
AB  - Methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. Two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. Subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. The rectangular views can be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. It is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. The estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. The enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Escherichia coli, which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. In view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) by using the name NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
TI  - Metronidazole activation and isolation of Clostridium acetobutylicum electron transport genes.
AB  - An Escherichia coli F19 recA, nitrate reductase-deficient mutant was constructed  by transposon mutagenesis and shown to be resistant to metronidazole. This mutant was a most suitable host for the isolation of Clostridium acetobutylicum genes on recombinant plasmids, which activated metronidazole and rendered the E. coli F19 strain sensitive to metronidazole. Twenty-five E. coli F19 clones containing different recombinant plasmids were isolated and classified into five groups on the basis of their sensitivity to metronidazole. The clones were tested for nitrate reductase, pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and hydrogenase activities. DNA hybridization and restriction endonuclease mapping revealed that four of the C. acetobutylicum insert DNA fragments on recombinant plasmids were linked in an 11.1-kb chromosomal fragment. DNA sequencing and amino acid homology studies indicated that this DNA fragment contained a flavodoxin gene which encoded a protein of 160 amino acids that activated metronidazole and made the E. coli F19 mutant very sensitive to metronidazole. The flavodoxin and hydrogenase genes which are involved in electron transfer systems were linked on the 11.1-kb DNA fragment from C. acetobutylicum.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a filamentous viruslike particle from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444.
AB  - A single-stranded 6.6-kb DNA molecule complexed with protein was recovered from the supernatant of Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444. Electron microscopic examination of the DNA-protein complex revealed the presence of a filamentous viruslike particle, which was designated CAK1. The possible double-stranded plasmidlike replicative form and the single-stranded prophage were also recovered from the cell culture following alkaline lysis. CAK1 was released from the C. acetobutylicum cell culture in the absence of cell lysis. Polyethylene glycol-NaCl coprecipitation of the DNA-protein complex revealed the presence of single-stranded DNA complexed with protein in a manner rendering the DNA resistant to Bal 31 exonuclease. Proteinase treatment of CsCl density gradient-purified CAK1 resulted in recovery of DNase-sensitive single-stranded DNA. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of CAK1 demonstrated the presence of a 5-kDa major coat protein. Hybridization data indicated that the single-stranded DNA from CAK1 has homology with the M13 phage of Escherichia coli. An examination of various physical properties of CAK1 suggests that it is similar to the filamentous phage recovered from gram-negative microorganisms. Although infectivity or inducibility of CAK1 could not be demonstrated, to our knowledge this represents the first report of a nonlytic filamentous viruslike particle containing single-stranded DNA being recovered from a gram-positive bacterium.
TI  - Natural transfer of conjugative transposon Tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative streptococcal transposon Tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. Enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for Alcaligenes eutrophus, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). No transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. Mating of an E. coli strain carrying Tn916 yielded transconjugants with Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). Acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. The results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as Tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially contributing to bacterial evolution.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and molecular analysis of the acetoacetate decarboxylase gene region from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Acetoacetate decarboxylase (ADC) (EC4.1.1.4) of Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 was purified to homogeneity, and its first 25 N-terminal amino acids were determined. Oligonucleotide probes deduced from this sequence were used to detect positive clones in partial gene banks derived from Sau3A and HaeIII digests with following ligation into the vector pUC9. In Escherichia coli, the 2.1-kbp HaeIII clones expressed high levels of ADC activity. The expression was independent of the orientation of the insert with respect to the lac promoter of the vector and also of the addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, thus indicating that sequences located on the clostridial DNA controlled transcription and translation. From the E. coli clone with the recombinant plasmid pUG93 containing the 2.1-kbp HaeIII fragment, the ADC protein was purified and compared with the native enzyme. Both were indistinguishable with respect to the molecular mass of subunits and native protein as well as to activity stain. The 2.9-kbp Sau3A fragment could be shown to contain the amino terminus of the acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc) gene but did not express enzyme activity. It partially overlapped with the HaeIII fragment, spanning together 4,053 bp of the clostridial genome that were completely sequenced. Four open reading frames (ORFs) could be detected, one of which was unambiguously assigned to the acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc) gene. Amino acid sequences of the N terminus and the catalytic center as deduced from the nucleotide sequence were identical to sequences obtained from direct analysis of the protein. Typical procaryotic transcriptional and translational start and stop signals could be found in the DNA sequence. Together with these regulatory sequences, the adc gene formed a single operon. The carboxyl terminus of the enzyme proved to be rather hydrophobic. In vitro transcription-translation assays resulted in formation of ADC and ORF3 gene product; the other two ORFs were not expressed. Whereas no homology of the adc gene and ORF2 could be detected with sequences available in the EMBL or GenBank data bases, the obviously truncated ORF1 showed significant similarity to alpha-amylase of Bacillus subtilis. The restriction pattern and N-terminal amino acid sequence (as deduced from the nucleotide sequence) of ORF3 proved to be identical to those of the large subunit of acetoacetyl coenzyme A:acetate/butyrate:coenzyme A transferase.
TI  - Cloning of a lactate dehydrogenase gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum B643 and  expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum B643 was cloned  on two recombinant plasmids, pPC37 and pPC58, that were selected by complementation of Escherichia coli PRC436 (acd), a fermentation-defective mutant that does not grow anaerobically on glucose. E. coli PRC436(pPC37) and PRC436(pPC58) grew anaerobically and fermented glucose to mostly lactate. When pPC37 and pPC58 were transformed into E. coli FMJ39 (ldh pfl), an LDH-deficient strain, the resulting strains grew anaerobically on glucose and produced lactate. Crude extracts of E. coli FMJ39(pPC37) and FMJ39(pP58) contained high LDH activity only when assayed for pyruvate reduction to lactate, and the LDH activity was activated 15- to 30-fold by the addition of fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP). E. coli FMJ39 had no detectable LDH activity, and E. coli LDH from a wild-type strain was not activated by FDP. Maxicell analysis showed that both plasmids pPC37 and pPC58 expressed a protein with an apparent Mr of 38,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Restriction endonuclease mapping of pPC37 and pPC58 and DNA hybridization studies indicated that a 2.1-kb region of these two clones of C. acetobutylicum DNA encodes the FDP-activated LDH.
TI  - Purification of acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and cloning of the acetoacetate decarboxylase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, acetoacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.4) is essential for solvent production, catalyzing the decarboxylation of acetoacetate to acetone. We report here the purification of the enzyme from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and the cloning and expression of the gene encoding the acetoacetate decarboxylase enzyme in Escherichia coli. A bacteriophage lambda EMBL3 library of C. acetobutylicum DNA was screened by plaque hybridization, using oligodeoxynucleotide probes derived from the N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from the purified protein. Phage DNA from positive plaques was analyzed by Southern hybridization. Restriction mapping and subsequent subcloning of DNA fragments hybridizing to the probes localized the gene within an approximately 2.1 kb EcoRI/Bg/II fragment. A polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 28,000 corresponding to that of the purified acetoacetate decarboxylase was observed in both Western blots (immunoblots) and maxicell analysis of whole-cell extracts of E. coli harboring the clostridial gene. Although the expression of the gene is tightly regulated in C. acetobutylicum, it was well expressed in E. coli, although from a promoter sequence of clostridial origin.
TI  - Studies on Clostridium acetobutylicum glnA promoters and antisense RNA.
AB  - The Clostridium acetobutylicum glnA gene has two transcript start sites under the control of promoters p1 and p2. Initiation of transcription was regulated by nitrogen and a downstream region was implicated in the regulation of transcript initiation by nitrogen in Escherichia coli. Putative antisense RNA was produced from a single downstream transcript start site under the control of p3. An up-promoter mutation in p3 resulted in lower levels of glutamine synthetase (GS) activity. Putative antisense RNA had a role in down-regulating GS expression but was not involved in regulation by nitrogen. Deletion of downstream inverted repeat sequences resulted in very low levels of GS activity.
TI  - Protein phosphorylation in response to stress in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The possible involvement of protein phosphorylation in the clostridial stress response was investigated by radioactively labeling growing cells of Clostridium acetobutylicum with 32Pi or cell extracts with [gamma-32P]ATP. Several phosphoproteins were identified; these were not affected by the growth stage of the culture. Although the extent of protein phosphorylation was increased by heat stress, the phosphoproteins did not correspond to known stress proteins seen in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified clostridial DnaK, a stress protein, acted as a kinase catalyzing the phosphorylation of a 50-kilodalton protein. The phosphorylation of this protein was enhanced in extracts prepared from heat-stressed cells. Diadenosine-5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate had no influence on protein phosphorylation.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 acetoacetyl-coenzyme A:acetate/butyrate:coenzyme A-transferase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Coenzyme A (CoA)-transferase (acetoacetyl-CoA:acetate/butyrate:CoA-transferase [butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase] [EC 2.8.3.9]) of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is an important enzyme in the metabolic shift between the acid-producing and solvent-forming states of this organism. The purification and properties of the enzyme have recently been described (D. P. Weisenborn, F. B. Rudolph, and E. T. Papoutsakis, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 55:323-329, 1989). The genes encoding the two subunits of this enzyme have been cloned by using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes designed from amino-terminal sequencing data from each subunit of the CoA-transferase. A bacteriophage lambda EMBL3 library of C. acetobutylicum DNA was prepared and screened by using these probes. Subsequent subcloning experiments established the position of the structural genes for CoA-transferase. Complementation of Escherichia coli ato mutants with the recombinant plasmid pCoAT4 (pUC19 carrying a 1.8-kilobase insert of C. acetobutylicum DNA encoding CoA-transferase activity) enabled the transformants to grow on butyrate as a sole carbon source. Despite the ability of CoA-transferase to complement the ato defect in E. coli mutants, Southern blot and Western blot (immunoblot) analyses showed that neither the C. acetobutylicum genes encoding CoA-transferase nor the enzyme itself shared any apparent homology with its E. coli counterpart. Polypeptides of Mr of the purified CoA-transferase subunits were observed by Western blot and maxicell analysis of whole-cell extracts of E. coli harboring pCoAT4. The proximity and orientation of the genes suggest that the genes encoding the two subunits of CoA-transferase may form an operon similar to that found in E. coli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Conjugative plasmid transfer from Escherichia coli to Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The conjugation mechanism of IncP plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from Escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. This strategy has been adapted for use with the Gram-positive anaerobe, Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052. Several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pAM beta 1 (Enterococcus faecalis), pCB101 (Clostridium butyricum) or pWV01 (Streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting oriT region of RK2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this organism. One of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of IS1. Conjugative mobilization of plasmids from E. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.
TI  - Use of immobilized microbial membrane fragments to remove oxygen and favor the acetone-butanol fermentation.
AB  - Oxygen-reducing membrane fragments obtained from Escherichia coli were used with  Clostridium acetobutylicum (C. acetobutylicum) to provide an oxygen-free microenvironment for the conversion of glucose to acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE). The batch fermentation of suspended C. acetobutylicum NRRL-B-643 and its ability to produce solvents in the presence of membranes as the oxygen-elimination agent are described and compared with the conventional sparging technique used to maintain anaerobiosis. The use of membrane fragments to remove oxygen for fermentation by C. acetobutylicum was successful and gave slightly improved results over the use of sparing with regard to lag, biomass, and solvent production (e.g., final butanol concentration of 3.25 and 2.7 g/L, respectively). Solvent production is also reported for a continuous columnar reactor with coimmobilized cells and membranes in kappa-carrageenan gel beads and air-saturated liquid feed.
TI  - Purification and characterization of fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes from Caulobacter crescentus.
AB  - Acetoacetyl coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA) thiolase, an enzyme required for short-chain fatty acid degradation, has been purified to near homogeneity from Caulobacter crescentus. The relative heat stability of this enzyme allowed it to be separated from beta-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. The purification scheme minus the heating step also permitted the copurification of crotonase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. These activities are in a multienzyme complex in Escherichia coli, but a similar complex was not observed in C. crescentus. Instead, separate proteins differing in enzymatic activity were detected, analogous to the beta-oxidation enzymes that have been isolated from Clostridium acetobutylicum and from mitochondria of higher eucaryotes. In these cells, as appears to be the case with C. crescentus, the individual enzymes form multimers of identical subunits.
TI  - Construction of shuttle vector plasmid between Clostridium acetobutylicum and Escherichia coli.
AB  - A high copy number plasmid pCS86 (3.0 kb) was isolated from Clostridium acetobutylicum strain No. 86. For developing the vector plasmid for gene cloning of saccharolytic clostridia, two hybrid plasmids were constructed by joining pCS86 to the E. coli promoter probe vector pKK232-8 carrying the promoterless gene of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). One of the hybrid plasmids designated as pTY10 replicated and expressed the CAT gene in E. coli, and transformed a plasmid-free strain, C. acetobutylicum strain No. 220, as a shuttle vector. This is the first shuttle vector constructed from C. acetobutylicum and E. coli plasmids. Reciprocal transformation was possible between E. coli and C. acetobutylicum, though deletion occurred in the sequence originated from pKK232-8. A deleted plasmid pTY101 only replicated in Clostridium, though it showed a high copy number.
TI  - Methods for cloning key primary metabolic enzymes and ancillary proteins associated with the acetone-butanol fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The unavailability of genetically defined mutants for complementation has intensified the problems inherent in cloning genes from C. acetobutylicum. The uniqueness of some of the pathways of this organism coupled with the relative inefficiency of transformation of clostridia and few characterized mutants in these pathways have made cloning these genes by traditional complementation methods impractical. Oligonucleotide hybridization techniques have been shown to circumvent many problems involved in detecting protein expression. The ease of hybridization screening of plaques allows phage libraries to be examined more readily than is generally the case with colony screening techniques. Recombinant lambda phages also contain more DNA per insert than most plasmid vectors can maintain, thus further decreasing the amount of screening necessary. Cosmid libraries, offering even greater length of individual inserts, can be screened in a similar manner, although such screening incorporates the limitations of colony screening techniques. It is true that the technique hinges on the ability to obtain an amino acid sequence from which an oligonucleotide can be designed. In the past, the ability to obtain sequences was limited because the quantity and number of purified proteins were limited or the proteins were amino-terminally blocked. However, recent technological advances in this area, such as high-resolution gel separation techniques coupled with microsequencing, have opened the door to proteins previously inaccessible. Deformylation methods have been developed to deblock amino-terminally formylated proteins, and successful internal amino acid sequence analysis by in situ protease digestion has also been reported using only picomolar quantities of proteins separated by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein and DNA sequence data banks have been significantly upgraded in the past few years. A proposed oligonucleotide sequence can be evaluated to determine what other possible sequences have similar homology; moreover, protein similarity comparisons between related species might possibly supplant the need for protein isolation if regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences are found. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported use of oligonucleotide probe hybridization screening technology as a strategy for cloning solvent pathway genes of C. acetobutylicum. Despite the deleterious effects on hybridization inherent in the high A + T content of C. acetobutylicum gene specific-directed oligonucleotides, the technique has been shown to function with few modifications to previously recorded systems.
TI  - Homology between hydroxybutyryl and hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase enzymes  from Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation and vertebrate fatty acid beta-oxidation pathways.
AB  - The enzymes NAD-dependent beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (BHBD) and 3-hydroxyacetyl coenzyme A (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA) dehydrogenase are part of the central fermentation pathways for butyrate and butanol production in the gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum and for the beta oxidation of fatty acids in eucaryotes, respectively. The C. acetobutylicum hbd gene encoding a bacterial BHBD was cloned, expressed, and sequenced in Escherichia coli. The deduced primary amino acid sequence of the C. acetobutylicum BHBD showed 45.9% similarity with the equivalent mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme and 38.4% similarity with the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase part of the bifunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase:3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from rat peroxisomes. The pig mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase showed 31.7% similarity with the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase part of the bifunctional enzyme from rat peroxisomes. The phylogenetic relationship between these enzymes supports a common evolutionary origin for the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathways of vertebrate mitochondria and peroxisomes and the bacterial fermentation pathway.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression of the glutamine synthetase structural gene, glnA, of the archaebacterium Methanococcus voltae.
AB  - The sequence of a 2,746-bp DNA fragment of Methanococcus voltae carrying the glnA gene for glutamine synthetase (GS), was established. A 1,338-bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a 446-amino-acid polypeptide of 50,142 Da, was defined as glnA on the basis of its similarity to other glnA genes and on the ability of a DNA fragment carrying this ORF to complement an Escherichia coli Gln- mutant. No sequence homology was found between sequences flanking the M. volae glnA gene and other eubacterial glnA genes. In M. voltae, the gene was transcribed as a monocistronic unit and GS synthesis was partially repressed at high ammonia concentrations. At the amino acid sequence level, the highest similarity was found with GS of Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Molecular analysis and nucleotide sequence of the adh1 gene encoding an NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase in the Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2081-bp fragment of Clostridium acetobutylicum DNA containing the adh1 gene was determined. The butanol dehydrogenase gene is referred to as the adh1 gene since it was shown to have activity using butanol and ethanol as substrates. The adh1 gene consisted of 1164 bp and encoded an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme of 388 aa residues with an Mr of 43,274. The adh1 gene was separated from an upstream open reading frame by an intergenic region of 354 bp. No promoter consensus sequences were identified in the intergenic upstream region and the adh1 gene did not appear to be expressed off its own promoter in Escherichia coli. Three separate types of ADH have been recognized. The ADH1 from C. acetobutylicum exhibited 39% homology with the Fe-containing ADH2 from Zymomonas mobilis and 37% homology with the ADH4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but showed little or no homology with the other characterised types of ADH.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Clostridium acetobutylicum alpha-amylase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A gene library of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824 was constructed in the plasmid vector pEcoR251. The library was tested for the presence of starch hydrolyzing clones. One clone in which the recombinant plasmid, pVP101, conferred alpha-amylase activity to the Escherichia coli host cell, was detected. The gene is carried on a 3.45-kbp BglII restriction fragment. A detailed physical map of pVP101 is presented.
TI  - Construction of shuttle vectors useful for transforming Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Plasmids pIM13, pT127 and pBC16 delta 1, introduced by transformation into Clostridium acetobutylicum N1-4081, were shown to replicate in, and to confer antibiotic resistance upon this new host. Recombinant plasmids were constructed by inserting erythromycin-resistant plasmid pIM13 into the unique ClaI site of pBR322 or by ligating a tetracycline-resistant determinant of plasmid pT127 to HindIII-linearized pIM13. The hybrid plasmids replicated and expressed erythromycin resistance in C. acetobutylicum strain N1-4081 and in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, indicating that they might be useful as shuttle vectors for transferring genes between these strains. The efficiency and stability of different replicons in C. acetobutylicum were compared.
TI  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase gene (glnA) of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The glutamine synthetase (GS) gene from Bacillus subtilis PCI 219 was cloned in Escherichia coli using the vector pBR329. A plasmid, pSGS2, was isolated from a glnA+ transformant and the cloned GS gene was found to be located in a 3.6 kb DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.8 kb segment encoding the GS was determined. This segment showed an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 444 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of this GS gene product has higher homology with that of the Clostridium acetobutylicum GS than that of the E. coli GS.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Streptomyces coelicolor gene encoding glutamine synthetase.
AB  - The Streptomyces coelicolor glutamine synthetase (GS) structural gene (glnA) was  cloned by complementing the glutamine growth requirement of an Escherichia coli strain containing a deletion of its glnALG operon. Expression of the cloned S. coelicolor glnA gene in E. coli cells was found to require an E. coli plasmid promoter. The nucleotide sequence of an S. coelicolor 2280-bp DNA segment containing the glnA gene was determined and the complete glnA amino acid sequence deduced. Comparison of the derived S. coelicolor GS protein sequence with the amino acid sequences of GS from other bacteria suggests that the S. coelicolor GS protein is more similar to the GS proteins from Gram-negative bacteria than it is with the GS proteins from two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Clostridium acetobutylicum phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 13.6-kilobase (kb) Sau3AI restriction endonuclease fragment of Clostridium acetobutylicum DNA cloned into pBR322 enabled Escherichia coli ato mutants to grow on butyrate as a sole carbon source (But+). Complementation of the ato defect by the recombinant plasmid pJC6 was due to expression of the genes for phosphotransbutyrylase (PTB) and butyrate kinase (BK). Both genes were efficiently expressed in E. coli, as their products were readily detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell extracts. PTB was found to have a polypeptide subunit molecular weight of approximately 31,000, while that of BK was approximately 39,000. Deletion analysis and Tn5 mutagenesis of plasmid pJC7 (a But+ subclone containing a 4.4-kb BamHI fragment from the insert of pJC6) localized the PTB and BK genes within a region spanning approximately 2.9 kb. Preliminary evidence suggests that the two genes may form an operon that is transcribed as a single unit from a promoter of clostridial origin within the 4.4-kb insert of pJC7.
TI  - Introduction of genes for leucine biosynthesis from Clostridium pasteurianum into C. acetobutylicum by cointegrate conjugal transfer.
AB  - A Clostridium pasteurianum gene bank was constructed in Escherichia coli, using plasmid pAT153, and several chromosomal fragments found which complemented both leuB and leuC mutations in auxotrophic E. coli K12 strains. No fragments capable of complementing leuA or leuD mutations were identified. Conjugal transfer of the leuB/leuC genes from Bacillus subtilis into two different Leu- C. acetobutylicum auxotrophic strains was elicited by their incorporation into a large plasmid cointegrate composed of the conjugal plasmid pAM beta 1 and a specially constructed gram-positive, replication-deficient plasmid, pMTL21 EC. Inheritance of the cointegrate plasmid restored one of the auxotrophic C. acetobutylicum strains to prototrophy. The second strain remained Leu-.
TI  - Stress- and Growth Phase-Associated Proteins of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The response of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 4259 to the stresses produced by  a temperature upshift from 28 degrees C to 45 degrees C and by exposure of the organisms to 0.1% n-butanol or to air was examined by analysis of pulse-labeled proteins. The stress response was the induction of the synthesis of a number of proteins, some of which were elicited by the three forms of stress. Eleven heat shock proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis, as were two proteins whose synthesis was heat sensitive. In the absence of applied stress, the synthesis of four proteins was found to be associated with the growth phase in batch culture; three of these proteins had a higher rate of de novo synthesis when the cells entered the solvent production phase. One of the stress-induced proteins, hsp74, was partially purified an found to be immunologically related to Escherichia coli heat shock protein Dnak. The similarities of the proteins induced at the onset of solventogenesis and by stress suggest a relationship between the two processes.
TI  - Cloning and Expression of a Clostridium acetobutylicum Alcohol Dehydrogenase Gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned on a recombinant plasmid, pCADH100. Escherichia coli HB101, and an allyl alcohol-resistant mutant, HB101-adh1, containing this plasmid were unable to grow aerobically or anaerobically on agar media containing sublethal concentrations of allyl alcohol. E. coli HB101 and HB101-adh1 transformed with the plasmid pCADH100 produced increased levels of ethanol when grown anaerobically under alkaline conditions in the absence of nitrate. Cell extracts from aerobically and anaerobically grown E. coli HB101(pCADH100) and HB101-adhl(pCADH100) cells exhibited increased levels of NADP-dependent ADH activity with either ethanol or butanol as the substrate. The inability of E. coli HB101(pCADH100) to grow in the presence of allyl alcohol correlated with the appearance of an NADP-dependent ADH activity band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with either ethanol or butanol as the substrate. The position of the cloned NADP-dependent ADH activity bands in E. coli HB101(pCADH100) cell extracts with either ethanol or butanol as the substrate coincided with the position of a single NADP-dependent ADH activity band in extracts of C. acetobutylicum cells. E. coli HB101(pCADH100) cell extracts prepared from both aerobically and anaerobically grown cells exhibited an additional protein band with an apparent M(r) of approximately 33,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis which was absent in cell extracts of E. coli HB101. A protein band with a similar apparent M(r) was observed in cell extracts of C. acetobutylicum, and in vitro transcription and translation experiments with pCADH100 produced a major protein product with a similar apparent M(r).
TI  - Amino acid transport by membrane vesicles of an obligate anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Membrane vesicles were isolated from the obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Beef heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase was inserted in these membrane vesicles by membrane fusion by using the freeze-thaw sonication technique (A. J. M. Driessen, W. de Vrij, and W. N. Konings, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:7555-7559, 1985) to accommodate them with a functional proton motive force-generating system. With ascorbate-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine-cytochrome c as the electron donor, a proton motive force (delta p) of -80 to -120 mV was generated in these fused membranes. This delta p drove the accumulation of leucine and lysine up to 40- and 100-fold, respectively. High transport activities were observed in fused membranes containing Escherichia coli lipids, whereas the transport activities in fused membranes containing mainly soybean lipids or phosphatidylcholine were low. It is suggested that branched-chain amino acids and lysine were taken up by separate systems. The effects of the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin indicated that lysine and leucine were translocated in symport with a proton.
TI  - Molecular analysis and regulation of the glnA gene of the gram-positive anaerobe  Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.0-kilobase DNA segment containing the Clostridium  acetobutylicum glnA gene was determined. The upstream region of the glnA gene contained two putative extended promoter consensus sequences (p1 and p2), characteristic of gram-positive bacteria. A third putative extended gram-positive promoter consensus sequence (p3), oriented towards the glnA gene, was detected downstream of the structural gene. The sequences containing the proposed promoter regions p1 and p2 or p3 were shown to have promoter activity by subcloning into promoter probe vectors. The complete amino acid sequence (444 residues) of the C. acetobutylicum glutamine synthetase (GS) was deduced, and comparisons were made with the reported amino acid sequences of GS from other organisms. To determine whether the putative promoter p3 and a downstream region with an extensive stretch of inverted repeat sequences were involved in regulation of C. acetobutylicum glnA gene expression by nitrogen in Escherichia coli, deletion plasmids were constructed lacking p3 and various downstream sequences. Deletion of the putative promoter p3 and downstream inverted repeat sequences affected the regulation of GS and reduced the levels of GS approximately fivefold under nitrogen-limiting conditions but did not affect the repression of GS levels in cells grown under nitrogen-excess conditions.
TI  - Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Glutamine Synthetase from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - A glutamine synthetase (GS) gene, glnA, from the gram-positive obligate anaerobe  Clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned on recombinant plasmid pHZ200 and enabled Escherichia coli glnA deletion mutants to utilize (NH(4))(2)SO(4) as a sole source of nitrogen. The cloned C. acetobutylicum gene was expressed from a regulatory region contained within the cloned DNA fragment. glnA expression was subject to nitrogen regulation in E. coli. This cloned glnA DNA did not enable an E. coli glnA ntrB ntrC deletion mutant to utilize arginine or low levels of glutamine as sole nitrogen sources, and failed to activate histidase activity in this strain which contained the Klebsiella aerogenes hut operon. The GS produced by pHZ200 was purified and had an apparent subunit molecular weight of approximately 59,000. There was no DNA or protein homology between the cloned C. acetobutylicum glnA gene and GS and the corresponding gene and GS from E. coli. The C. acetobutylicum GS was inhibited by Mg in the gamma-glutamyl transferase assay, but there was no evidence that the GS was adenylylated.
TI  - Amino acid sequence of the pyruvate and the glyoxylate active-site lysine peptide of Escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  - Pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase of Escherichia coli, a "lysine-type" trimeric enzyme which has the unique properties of forming an "abortive" Schiff-base intermediate with glyoxylate (the aldehydic product/substrate) and of showing strong beta-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate, binds any one of its substrates (2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate) in a competitive manner. To determine whether the substrates bind at the same or different (juxta-positioned) sites and what degree of homology might exist between the active-site lysine peptide of this enzyme and that of other lysine-type (Class I) aldolases or beta-decarboxylases, the azomethine formed separately by this aldolase with either [14C]pyruvate or [14C]glyoxylate was reduced with CNBH3-. After each enzyme adduct was digested with trypsin, the 14C-labeled peptide was isolated, purified, and subjected to amino acid analysis and sequence determination. In each case, the same 14-amino acid lysine-peptide was isolated and found to have the following primary sequence: Glu-Phe-*Lys-Phe-Phe-Pro-Ala-Glu-Ala-Asn-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys (where * = the active-site lysine). Hence, glyoxylate competes for, and inhibits aldolase activity by reacting with, the one active-site lysine residue/subunit. This active-site lysine peptide has a high degree (65%) of homology with that of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of Pseudomonas putida but is not similar to that of any Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or of acetoacetate beta-decarboxylase of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Furthermore, it was found that extensive reaction of glyoxylate with the N-terminal amino group of this enzyme may well be general complicating factor in sequence studies with proteins plus glyoxylate.
TI  - Cloning of Clostridium acetobutylicum genes and their expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - DNA from Clostridium acetobutylicum ABKn8 was partially digested with Sau3A and the fragments obtained were inserted into the unique BamHI site of the cloning vector pHV33. The recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli HB101 with selection for ampicillin resistance. A collection of ampicillin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive clones representative of the Clostridium acetobutylicum genome was made. The clones were shown to carry recombinant plasmids each containing an insert of 2 to 16 kb in size. Several of them complemented the HB101 proA2 or leuB6 auxotrophic mutations. The cloned sequences were shown by Southern blot hybridization to be homologous to the corresponding ABKn8 DNA fragments.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase, cellobiase and amino acid biosynthesis genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum P262 endoglucanase and cellobiase genes, cloned on a 4.9 kb DNA fragment in the recombinant plasmid pHZ100, were expressed from their own promoter in Escherichia coli. Active carboxymethylcellulase and cellobiase enzymes were produced, but there was no degradation of Avicel. The endoglucanase activities observed in cell extracts of E. coli HB101(pHZ100) differed in their pH and temperature optima from those previously reported for C. acetobutylicum P270. Complementation of E. coli arg and his mutations by cloned C. acetobutylicum DNA was also observed.
TI  - Gene transfer, recombination and gene cloning in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Although Clostridium acetobutylicum has been used for over 70 years for the industrial production of solvents, it is only recently that studies on the genetics of this organism have been initiated. Recent advances in the development of genetic transfer systems as well as the cloning and expression of genes from this organism in Escherichia coli are reviewed.
