TI  == acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacterium in the family rikenellaceae isolated from a reed swamp.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, carbohydrate-fermenting, hydrogen-producing bacterium, designated strain rl-c(t), was isolated from a reed swamp in china. cells were gram-stain-negative, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile  rods measuring 0.7-1.0 microm in width and 3.0-8.0 microm in length. the optimum  temperature for growth of strain rl-c(t) was 37 degrees c (range 25-40 degrees c) and ph 7.0-7.5 (range ph 5.7-8.0). the strain could grow fermentatively on yeast  extract, tryptone, arabinose, glucose, galactose, mannose, maltose, lactose, glycogen, pectin and starch. the main end products of glucose fermentation were acetate, h2 and co2. organic acids, alcohols and amino acids were not utilized for growth. yeast extract was not required for growth; however, it stimulated growth slightly. nitrate, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and fe(iii) nitrilotriacetate were not reduced as terminal electron acceptors. aesculin was hydrolysed but not gelatin. indole and h2s were produced from yeast  extract. the g+c content of the genomic dna was 51.2 mol%. the major cellular fatty acids were iso-c15 : 0, anteiso-c15 : 0 and c16 : 0. the most abundant polar lipid of strain rl-c(t) was phosphatidylethanolamine. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate belongs to the uncultured blvii28 wastewater-sludge group (http://www.arb-silva.de/) in the family rikenellaceae of the phylum bacteroidetes, and shared low sequence similarities with the related species alistipes shahii wal 8301(t) (81.8 %), rikenella microfusus atcc 29728(t) (81.7 %) and anaerocella delicata wn081(t) (80.9 %). on the basis of these data,  a novel species in a new genus of the family rikenellaceae is proposed, acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of the type species is rl-c(t) ( = jcm 17603(t) = dsm 24657(t) = cgmcc 1.5173(t)).

TI  == alistipes onderdonkii sp. nov. and alistipes shahii sp. nov., of human origin.
AB  == two groups of previously unknown gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, pigment-producing, rod-shaped bacteria, which phenotypically and phylogenetically displayed a close association with the recently described species alistipes finegoldii, were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods.  a 16s rrna gene sequence divergence of approximately 3 % between the two unknown  bacteria and a. finegoldii, as well as distinguishable biochemical characteristics, demonstrates that these organisms are genotypically and phenotypically distinct and that each group represents a previously unknown subline within the genus alistipes. chromosomal dna-dna reassociation studies further confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacteria and a. finegoldii. on the basis of the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, two novel species, alistipes onderdonkii sp. nov. and alistipes shahii sp. nov., are proposed. the type strains of a. onderdonkii and a. shahii are wal 8169(t) (=ccug 48946(t)=atcc baa-1178(t)) and wal 8301(t) (=ccug 48947(t)=atcc baa-1179(t)), respectively; their dna g+c contents are 58 and 56 mol%, respectively.
