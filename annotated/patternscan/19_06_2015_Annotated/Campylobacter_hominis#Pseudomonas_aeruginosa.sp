TI  == etiology of acute childhood diarrhoea in calcutta.
AB  == of the 152 cases of acute diarrhoea, 124 (81.5%) revealed potential pathogens. altogether 27 (21.2%) out of 127 strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, proteus and acinetobacter produced enterotoxin. single  pathogenic bacteria (40 cases 26.3%), parasite (6; 6%), rota virus (6; 6%), toxigenic bacteria (19; 12.5%) and mixed agents (37; 24.24.3%) were recorded in 108 cases (71.0%). another 14 (9.2%) cases exclusively revealed moderate to heavy growth of suspected enteric pathogens like k. pneumoniae, proteus, enterobacter,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerogenic e. coli and citrobacter and 2 (1.3%) had high counts of t'. hominis. of the known pathogens, the preponderance of a. hydrophila (24.4%), rota virus (15.7%) and aeromonas hydrophila (14.0%) in 1-4 y, vibrio cholerae (45.6%) and trichuris trichiura (13.0%) in 4-14 y age group is highlighted. other pathogenic bacteria were non-01 v. cholerae (3.2%), v. parahaemolyticus (2.6%), v. fluvialis (0.6), plesiomonas shigelloides (3.9%), salmonella (2.6%), shigella (1.9%), epec (1.9%), eec (5.2%) and campylobacter jejuni (3.9%) and the parasites were entamoeba histolytica (2.6%) and giardia intestinalis (2.6). comparative study of age matched controls with those of diarrhoea suggested the pathogenic role of e. histolytica and t. hominis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.
