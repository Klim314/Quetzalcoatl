TI  == in vitro characterization of aggregation and adhesion properties of viable and heat-killed forms of two probiotic lactobacillus strains and interaction with foodborne zoonotic bacteria, especially campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == bacterial aggregation and/or adhesion are key factors for colonization of the digestive ecosystem and the ability of probiotic strains to exclude pathogens. in the present study, two probiotic strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lactobacillus farciminis cncm-i-3699, were evaluated as viable or heat-killed forms and compared with probiotic reference lactobacillus strains (lb. rhamnosus  gg and lb. farciminis cip 103136). the autoaggregation potential of both forms was higher than that of reference strains and twice that of pathogenic strains. the coaggregation potential of these two beneficial micro-organisms was evaluated against several pathogenic agents that threaten the global safety of the feed/food chain: escherichia coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes. the strongest coaggregative interactions were demonstrated with campylobacter spp. by a coaggregation test, confirmed by electron microscopic examination for the two forms. viable forms were investigated for the nature of the bacterial cell-surface molecules involved, by  sugar reversal tests and chemical and enzymic pretreatments. the results suggest  that the coaggregation between both probiotic strains and c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) is mediated by a carbohydrate-lectin interaction. the autoaggregation potential of the two probiotics decreased upon exposure to proteinase, sds or licl, showing that proteinaceous components on the surface of the two lactobacilli play an important role in this interaction. adhesion abilities of both lactobacillus strains were also demonstrated at significant levels on caco-2 cells, mucin and extracellular matrix material. both viable and heat-killed forms of the two probiotic lactobacilli inhibited the attachment of c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) to mucin. in conclusion, in vitro assays showed that lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, as viable or heat-killed forms, are adherent to different intestinal matrix models and are highly aggregative in vitro with pathogens, especially campylobacter spp., the most commonly reported zoonotic agent in the european union. this study supports the need for further in vivo investigations to demonstrate the potential food safety benefits of lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, live or heat-killed, in the global feed/food chain.
