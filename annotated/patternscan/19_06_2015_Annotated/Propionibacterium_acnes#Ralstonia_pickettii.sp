TI  == the fate of elbows with unexpected positive intraoperative cultures during revision elbow arthroplasty.
AB  == background: an intraoperative culture sample obtained during revision elbow arthroplasty that is unexpectedly positive poses a dilemma for the surgeon. the purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of positive cultures during  revision elbow arthroplasty when infection is not suspected preoperatively, and the long-term implications of these positive cultures. methods: two hundred and thirteen consecutive revision elbow arthroplasties were performed at our institution between 2000 and 2007. of these, sixteen patients had unexpected positive intraoperative cultures. results: the majority of cultures grew either staphylococcus epidermidis or propionibacterium acnes. twelve patients had more than two years of follow-up. one of the twelve patients was treated as for an infection because of unexplained early implant loosening and the isolation of staphylococcus epidermidis. ten of the twelve elbows were treated as "contaminants" and did not receive long-term antibiotic treatment. nine of these  ten remained infection-free at the time of the final follow-up, while the remaining one developed an infection with a different organism. conclusions: in our series, there was a 7.5% chance of encountering an unexpected positive result on intraoperative culture at the time of revision elbow arthroplasty. the majority of patients were successfully treated without antibiotics with a low rate of failure. a minority were considered as infections, typically presenting with unexplained early loosening and isolation of an organism on solid culture medium.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.
