TI  == a dna array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  == an oligonucleotide array based on pcr method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the  simultaneous identification of 14 lactic acid bacteria (lab) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. the hypervariable regions v3 and v6 of 16s, together with a variable region of 23s rrna genes and several genes specific for  virulence factors were selected. universal primers and multiplex pcr were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. the dominant species such as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, andleuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dutps. the results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic dna from campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. a clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  == a new bacteriocin, produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. by its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other s. thermophilus bacteriocin. the mode of action is bacteriostatic. this peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several bacillus species, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. this bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by ph variation from 3 to 10. six months of storage at 40 degrees c did not influence the activity. the inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in sds-page supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. the low sensitivity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to  the isolated bacteriocin suggests that s. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt  starters.

TI  == analysis of the icsba locus required for biosynthesis of the inner core region from neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == by deletion mutagenesis in the entire meningococcal chromosome, we have previously identified the icsa gene, which encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glcnac to hep-ii in the inner core of meningococcal lps. this gene has homology to several lps glycosyltransferases, notably to rfak from salmonella typhimurium and bplh from bordetella pertussis, both of which encode glcnac transferases. directly upstream of icsa is an orf showing significant homology to the hypothetical protein hi0653 from the haemophilus influenzae genome sequence, and to a lesser degree to putative glycosyltransferases from streptococcus thermophilus and yersinia enterocolitica. insertional inactivation  of this orf resulted in a meningococcal strain with truncated lps. we have named  this new lps-involved gene icsb. differences in binding of monoclonal antibodies  and in mobility on tricine-sds-page showed that lps from icsa and icsb mutants is similar but not identical. on the basis of these results, we postulated that the  new gene encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glc to hep-i. structural analysis of purified mutant lps by electrospray mass spectrometry was  used to verify this hypothesis. the composition determined for icsa and icsb is lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea and lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea-glcnac, respectively. the icsa and icsb genes thus form an operon encoding the glycosyltransferases required for chain elongation from the lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2 basal structure, with icsa first adding glcnac to hep-ii and icsb subsequently adding glc to hep-i. only then is completion of the lacto-n-neotetraose structure possible through the action of the igta-e genes.
