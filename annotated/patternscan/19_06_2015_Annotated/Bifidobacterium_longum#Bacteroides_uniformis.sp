TI  == ethnic diversity of gut microbiota: species characterization of bacteroides fragilis group and genus bifidobacterium in healthy belgian adults, and comparison with data from japanese subjects.
AB  == the composition of the human gut microbiota is related to host health, and it is  thought that dietary habits may play a role in shaping this composition. here, we examined the population size and prevalence of six predominant bacterial genera and the species compositions of genus bifidobacterium (g-bifid) and bacteroides fragilis group (g-bfra) in 42 healthy belgian adults by quantitative pcr (qpcr) over a period of one month. the population sizes and prevalence of these bacteria were basically stable throughout the study period. the predominant g-bifid species were bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum ss. longum,  and the predominant g-bfra species were bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis, and bacteroides ovatus. the belgian gut microbiota data were then compared with gut microbiota data from 46 japanese subjects collected according to the same protocol (matsuki et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70, 167-173, 2004). the population size and prevalence of bifidobacterium catenulatum group were significantly lower in the belgian gut microbiota than in the japanese gut microbiota (p < 0.001); however, the population size and prevalence of g-bifid did not differ. this species-level qpcr analysis will be helpful for investigating the diversity of gut microbiota among ethnic groups.

TI  == application of several molecular techniques to study numerically predominant bifidobacterium spp. and bacteroidales order strains in the feces of healthy children.
AB  == bifidobacteria and bacteroides-like bacteria are strictly anaerobic nonpathogenic members of human intestinal microflora. here we describe an analysis of the species and subspecies composition of these bacterial populations in healthy children using a combination of culture and molecular methods at two different time points. it was found that b. bifidum and b. longum are the most common dominant taxons in infants aged between 8 and 16 months. the majority of the infants carried several dominant bifidobacterium strains belonging to different species. examination of the dominant bifidoflora in some of these children after  a 5-year period showed major shifts in both species and strain composition, but the dominant strains remained unchanged in two children. the majority of dominant bacteroides-like isolates belonged to species b. vulgatus and b. uniformis, but members of genera alistipes and barnesiella were common too. in addition, a novel approach to species identification of bacteroidales order bacteria using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) is described.
