[outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.
[assessment of antagonistic activity in vitro lactobacillus spp. strains againts  clostridum difficile strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of patients hospitalized in three hospitals in region mazovia].
introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of  lactobacillus strains against clinical c. difficile strains isolated from faecal samples of adults patients with diarrhea. a total 61 strains of c. difficile randomly selected isolated in the period 2007-2008 from the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients in three hospitals province mazovia, poland. to determination of antagonistic activity ofprobiotic lactobacillus spp. strains used four reference strains: lactobacillus plantarum 2017405, lactobacillus fermentum 353, lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 21007 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. methods: isolation of c. difficile was performed on selective columbia agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxitine and amphothericin b (clo medium, biomerieux, france). the plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37 degrees c. isolates were identified as c. difficile by the characteristic morphology of the colonies and horse-like odour, green yellow fluorescence under uv. toxigenicity of of c. difficile strains was determined in pcr to detection of fragments of genes encoding toxin a (tcda), toxin b (tcdb) and binary toxin (cdta and cdtb). the study of antagonistic activity four lactobacillus spp. strains against 61 clinical c. difficile strains was performed according to standard methods. lactobacillus strains were inoculated on mrs medium and incubated in oxygen-free atmosphere and cut the bars of mrs agar and applied to the plate with cultures of c. difficile strains. results: assessment of antagonist activity of lactobacillus spp. strains was performed by measuring the zone of inhibition of grown of c. difficile strains. the study shows that of probiotic lactobacillus spp. strains interacted antagonistically in vitro against all toxigenic (a+b+cdt- and a+b+cdt+) of c. difficile strains. conclusions: the differences in the antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. strains against different toxigenic clinical c. difficile strains were not observed.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21 days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.
isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
