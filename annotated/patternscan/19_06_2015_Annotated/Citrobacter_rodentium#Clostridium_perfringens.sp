TI  == influence of gastric acid on susceptibility to infection with ingested bacterial  pathogens.
AB  == despite the widely held belief that gastric acid serves as a barrier to bacterial pathogens, there are almost no experimental data to support this hypothesis. we have developed a mouse model to quantify the effectiveness of gastric acid in mediating resistance to infection with ingested bacteria. mice that were constitutively hypochlorhydric due to a mutation in a gastric h(+)/k(+)-atpase (proton pump) gene were infected with yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter rodentium, or clostridium perfringens cells or spores. significantly greater numbers of yersinia, salmonella, and citrobacter cells (p < or = 0.006) and clostridium spores (p = 0.02) survived in  hypochlorhydric mice, resulting in reduced median infectious doses. experiments involving intraperitoneal infection or infection of mice treated with antacids indicated that the increased sensitivity of hypochlorhydric mice to infection was entirely due to the absence of stomach acid. apart from establishing the role of  gastric acid in nonspecific immunity to ingested bacterial pathogens, our model provides an excellent system with which to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria on susceptibility to infection and to evaluate the in vivo susceptibility to gastric acid of orally administered therapies, such as vaccines and probiotics.
