TI  == effect of lactococcus lactis clfp 100 and leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196 on aeromonas salmonicida infection in brown trout (salmo trutta).
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis in salmonid fish.  this pathogen is important from an epizootic perspective because fish surviving an outbreak can remain lifelong asymptomatic carriers, serving as reservoirs of infection. as a result, the early detection and the control of infection are essential to prevent the spread of new furunculosis outbreaks. we have thus analyzed the effect of probiotic administration on the incidence of a. salmonicida in brown trout (salmo trutta), that were subjected to temperature stress. treatment with probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis clfp 100 and leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196) resulted in a higher survival rate after challenge, activation of phagocytic cells in the head kidney, and a lower rate of pathogen proliferation in the intestine as determined by real-time pcr.

TI  == enhancement of the immune response and protection induced by probiotic lactic acid bacteria against furunculosis in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss).
AB  == we analysed the effect of probiotic strains on the cellular and humoral immune responses of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), and their capacity to prevent furunculosis during a challenge trial. probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis clfp 100, leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196, and lactobacillus sakei clfp 202) were administered orally to fish for 2 weeks at 10(6) cfu g(-1) of feed. in  comparison to untreated control fish, the phagocytic activity of head kidney leukocytes and the alternative complement activity in serum were significantly greater in all probiotic groups at the end of the second week. with the exception of the group fed with lactobacillus sakei, superoxide anion production was also significantly increased in the probiotic groups. analysis of lysozyme activity did not exhibit any significant difference in the probiotic and control groups. fifteen days after the start of the probiotic feeding, fish were challenged with  aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida. the fish supplemented with probiotics exhibited survival rates ranging from 97.8% to 100%, whereas survival was 65.6% in fish not treated with the probiotics. these results demonstrate that probiotic supplementation to fish can reduce the severity of furunculosis, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.

TI  == immune modulation by probiotic strains: quantification of phagocytosis of aeromonas salmonicida by leukocytes isolated from gut of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) using a radiolabelling assay.
AB  == a method is described for the rapid and sensitive assay of phagocytosis that utilizes radioactively labelled bacteria. with this method, we observed that phagocytosis of heat-inactivated aeromonas salmonicida by leukocytes isolated from gut of rainbow trout fed with different viable probiotics (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus sakei, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) was significantly higher (p<0.05) after 2 weeks of probiotic-feeding than the control group. however, only phagocytosis of live a. salmonicida by the leukocytes isolated from gut of rainbow trout fed with l. lactis subsp. lactis was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the control group.
