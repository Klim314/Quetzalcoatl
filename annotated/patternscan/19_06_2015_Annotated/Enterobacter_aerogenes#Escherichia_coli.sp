TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  == objective: to investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae  in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. methods: esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. esbl/ampc/carbapenemase genes were analysed using pcr and sequencing. for e. coli, phylogenetic groups and mlst were determined. plasmids were characterized by transformation and pcr-based replicon typing. subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. results: 175 esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. the isolates were escherichia coli(n=65), citrobacter freundii (n=52), enterobacter cloacae (n=38), morganella morganii (n=5), enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), hafnia alvei (n=2), shigella spp. (n=2), citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), escherichia hermannii (n=1), kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and pantoea agglomerans (n=1). the following esbl genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blactx-m-1 (n=17), blactx-m-15 (n=16), blactx-m-14 (n=9), blactx-m-2 (n=3), blactx-m-3 (n=2), blactx-m-24 (n=2), blactx-m-27 (n=1), blactx-m-32 (n=1), blashv-12 (n=2), blashv-65 (n=1) and blatem-52 (n=1). plasmidic ampc (pampc) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. one person carried two different e. coli isolates, one with blactx-m-1 and the other with blacmy-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying enterobacteriaceae harboring esbl and/or pampc genes was 5.2 %. in eight e. coli isolates the ampc phenotype was caused by mutations in the ampc promoter  region. no carbapenemase genes were identified. a large variety of e. coli genotypes was found, st131 and st10 being most common. conclusions: esbl/pampc genes resembled those from patients in dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. the role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.

TI  == an efficient ribitol-specific dehydrogenase from enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == an nad(+)-dependent ribitol dehydrogenase from enterobacter aerogenes kctc 2190 (eardh) was cloned and successfully expressed in escherichia coli. the complete 729-bp gene was amplified, cloned, expressed, and subsequently purified in an active soluble form using nickel affinity chromatography. the enzyme had an optimal ph and temperature of 11.0 and 45 degrees c, respectively. among various  polyols, eardh exhibited activity only toward ribitol, with km, vmax, and kcat/km values of 10.3mm, 185umg(-1), and 30.9s(-1)mm(-1), respectively. the enzyme showed strong preference for nad(+) and displayed no detectable activity with nadp(+). homology modeling and sequence analysis of eardh, along with its biochemical properties, confirmed that eardh belongs to the family of nad(+)-dependent ribitol dehydrogenases, a member of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (scor) family. eardh showed the highest activity and unique substrate specificity among all known rdhs. homology modeling and docking  analysis shed light on the molecular basis of its unusually high activity and substrate specificity.

TI  == separation and confirmation of nine enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the gene.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla ndm-1 gene in clinics in hainan province, china. collected clinical bacterial isolates that were enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (ip/ipi) e-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and agarose gel electrophoresis (age) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. the species of the strains carrying the bla ndm-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. through the ip/ipi e-test, 21 of the 30 collected enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. following bla ndm-1 gene pcr amplification, age and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene. the biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were klebsiella pneumoniae, two were escherichia coli, two were enterobacter cloacae and one was enterobacter aerogenes. drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. however, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin b and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. the sensitivity rate  to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. this clinical study of enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla ndm-1 gene in hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated from vegetables imported from the dominican republic, india, thailand, and vietnam.
AB  == to examine to what extent fresh vegetables imported into switzerland represent carriers of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, 169 samples of different types of fresh vegetables imported into switzerland from the dominican republic, india, thailand, and vietnam were analyzed. overall, 25.4% of the vegetable samples yielded one or more esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, 78.3% of which were multidrug resistant. sixty isolates were  obtained: escherichia coli, 26; klebsiella pneumoniae, 26; enterobacter cloacae,  6; enterobacter aerogenes, 1; and cronobacter sakazakii, 1. we found 29 isolates  producing ctx-m-15, 8 producing ctx-m-14, 7 producing ctx-m-55, 3 producing ctx-m-65, 1 each producing ctx-m-1, ctx-m-3, ctx-m-27, and ctx-m-63, 5 producing  shv-2, 3 producing shv-12, and 1 producing shv-2a. four of the e. coli isolates belonged to epidemiologically important clones: ctx-m-15-producing b2:st131 (1 isolate), d:st405 (1 isolate), and d:st38 (2 isolates). one of the d:st38 isolates belonged to the extraintestinal enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec) d:st38  lineage. two of the k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the epidemic clones sequence type 15 (st15) and st147. the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic and commensal enterobacteriaceae in imported agricultural foodstuffs constitutes a source of esbl genes and a concern for food safety.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == first report of a clinical, multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolate coharboring fosfomycin resistance gene fosa3 and carbapenemase gene blakpc-2 on the same transposon, tn1721.
AB  == in order to understand the genetic background and dissemination mechanism of carbapenem resistance and fosfomycin resistance in enterobacteriaceae isolates, we studied a clinical escherichia coli strain hs102707 isolate and an enterobacter aerogenes strain hs112625 isolate, both of which were resistant to carbapenem and fosfomycin and positive for the bla(kpc-2) and fosa3 genes. in addition, a clinical klebsiella pneumoniae strain hs092839 isolate which was resistant to carbapenem was also studied. a 70-kb plasmid was successfully transferred to recipient e. coli j53 by a conjugation test. pcr and southern blot analysis showed that bla(kpc-2) was located on this plasmid. the complete sequence of phs102707 showed that this plasmid belongs to the p11 subfamily (incp1) and has a replication gene, several plasmid-stable genes, an intact type  iv secretion system gene cluster, and a composite transposon tn1721-tn3 that harbored bla(kpc-2). interestingly, a composite is26 transposon carrying fosa3 was inserted in the tn1721-tnpa gene in phs102707 and phs112625, leading to the disruption of tn1721-tnpa and the deletion of tn1721-tnpr. however, only is26 with a truncated tn21-tnpr was inserted in phs092839 at the same position. to our knowledge, this is the first report of fosa3 and bla(kpc-2) colocated in the same tn1721-tn3-like composite transposon on a novel incp group plasmid.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular characteristics of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in a health care system in los angeles, california, from 2011  to 2013.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are a concern for health care in the united states but remain relatively uncommon in california. we describe the phenotype, clonality, and carbapenemase-encoding genes present in cre isolated from patients at a californian tertiary health care system. cre for this study were identified by evaluating the antibiograms of enterobacteriaceae isolated in  the ucla health system from 2011 to 2013 for isolates that were not susceptible to meropenem and/or imipenem. the identification of these isolates was subsequently confirmed by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time of flight, and broth microdilution tests were repeated to confirm the cre phenotype. real-time pcr for bla(kpc), bla(sme), bla(imp), bla(ndm-1), bla(vim), and bla(oxa-48) was performed. clonality was assessed by repetitive sequence-based pcr (reppcr) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). of 15,839 nonduplicate clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates, 115 (0.73%) met the study definition for cre. this number increased from 0.5% (44/8165) in the first half of the study to  0.9% (71/7674) in the second (p = 0.004). the most common cre species were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli. a carbapenemase-encoding gene was found in 81.7% (94/115) of cre and included bla(kpc) (78.3%), bla(ndm-1) (0.9%), and bla(sme) (2.6%). the majority of bla(kpc) genes were in k. pneumoniae isolates, which fell into 14 clonal groups on typing. bla(kpc) was identified in more than one species of cre cultured from  the same patient in four cases. three bla(sme)-carrying serratia marcescens isolates and one bla(ndm-1) carrying providencia rettgeri isolate were detected.  cre are increasing in california, and carbapenemases, particularly kpc, are a common mechanism for carbapenem resistance in this region.

TI  == fast and continuous microorganism detection using aptamer-conjugated fluorescent  nanoparticles on an optofluidic platform.
AB  == fast and accurate pathogen detection in aquatic environments is challenging in many biomedical studies and microbial diagnostic applications. in this study, we  developed a real-time, continuous, and non-destructive single cell detection method using target specific aptamer-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles (a-fnps) and an optofluidic particle-sensor platform. a-fnps selectively bound to the surfaces of target bacteria (escherichia coli) and labeled them with high affinity and selectivity so that target bacteria can be countable particles in an optofluidic particle-sensor. a-fnp-labeled target bacterial complexes were detected by the optofluidic particle-sensing system, which provides rapid and continuous single-cell detection. a-fnps selectively bound to e. coli with a dissociation constant of 0.83 nm, but did not bind enterobacter aerogenes or citrobacter freundii strains, which lacked affinity for the aptamer used. we demonstrated that our optofluidic device achieves a detection throughput of ~100  particles per second with high accuracy (~85%) in detecting single bacterial cells conjugated with a-fnps. this approach can be immediately extended to the real-time, high-throughput detection of other microorganisms such as viruses that are selectively conjugated with a-fnps. collectively, these data suggest that optofluidic systems are widely applicable for the fast and continuous detection of microbial cells.

TI  == decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  == bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. decoction showed the  highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. in general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus aerogenes, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. this sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses,  is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.

TI  == screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  == betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. a library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. primary antimicrobial  screening at 50 microm concentration led to the identification of five compounds  showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). according to the dose-response results, 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing mic90 of 6.25 microm against two gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis and s. aureus. however, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with ic50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microm, respectively. the ic50 value for 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microm. the current study presents  an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico admet predictions.

AB  == background: blood stream infections (bsis) due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are associated with high hospital mortality rates and present a tremendous challenge to clinicians. the optimal treatment remains undefined. we aimed to investigate the risk factors for mortality and the correlation between different treatment modalities and outcomes. methods: the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of a cohort of 36 patients with bsis due to cre were investigated and a retrospective nested case-control study of surviving and non-surviving patients was conducted. results: fifty percent of  the cases were male and the mean patient age was 54.9 +/- 15.8 years. klebsiella  pneumoniae was the etiological agent in 26 cases (72.2%), escherichia coli in eight (22.2%), and enterobacter aerogenes in two (5.5%). all strains were phenotypically positive for carbapenemase activity and all except two (one e. coli and one k. pneumoniae) yielded both blaoxa-48 carbapenemases and blactx-m-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in pcr products. the 14-day, 28-day, and all-cause in-hospital mortality rates were 41.6%, 50%, and 58.3%, respectively. the median time to death was 8 days (range 2-52 days). no significant differences were observed between survivors and non-survivors in terms of baseline characteristics, comorbid conditions, etiologies, or sources of bacteremia, however hematological malignancies (p=0.015) and prolonged neutropenia (p=0.044) were more common in non-survivors. microbiological eradication and clinical response within 7 days were two major determinants of 28-day attributable mortality (p=0.001 and p=0.001, adjusted r(2)=0.845). colistin-based dual combinations, and preferably triple combinations, were associated with significantly better outcomes when compared to non-colistin-based regimens (p<0.001). time to active treatment had a significant effect on the course of infection (p=0.014). conclusion: earlier active treatment with colistin based regimens and microbiological and clinical response within 7 days are major  predictors of survival in cases of bsis due to cre. rectal screening offers the advantage of earlier recognition and prompt empirical treatment.

TI  == effect of vitreoscilla hemoglobin and culture conditions on production of bacterial l-asparaginase, an oncolytic enzyme.
AB  == l-asparaginase is a widely used cancer chemotherapy enzyme. the source for the enzyme with this property is mainly bacterial and its synthesis is strongly regulated by oxygen. in this study, we utilized two recombinant systems: one carried the gene (vgb) for the vitreoscilla hemoglobin (vhb), a protein of prokaryotic origin which confers a highly efficient oxygen uptake to its host and the other carried the l-asparaginase gene (ansb). the host bacteria were escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. of these three bacteria, all gram-negative, e. coli and its recombinant strain showed up to sevenfold higher l-asparaginase activity in lactose than in other carbon sources. although, in this bacterium glycerol was the poorest source for l-asparaginase synthesis, it supported the highest biomass production. in glucose medium, l-asparaginase activity of e. aerogenes was about threefold higher than its vgb and ansb recombinants. ansb recombinant showed significantly higher enzyme levels than both host and vgb recombinants in glycerol and lactose media.  in this bacterium, vhb/vgb clearly caused a decrease in the enzyme synthesis under all conditions. as seen for e. aerogens, glycerol was the most favorable carbon source for p. aeruginosa and its vgb strain in terms of both l-asparaginase synthesis and biomass production. the cultures grown in glycerol had more than two- and threefold biomass than in glucose and lactose, respectively, and up to elevenfold than in mannitol. indeed, the highest biomass  production for all bacteria and their recombinants was in glycerol. the vhb/vgb system is clearly advantageous for production of l-asparaginase in p. aeruginosa. the same, however, does not hold true for e. aerogenes.

TI  == transport of nickel and cobalt ions into bacterial cells by s components of ecf transporters.
AB  == energy-coupling factor (ecf) transporters form a distinct group of abc-type micronutrient importers in prokaryotes that do not contain extracytoplasmic, soluble substrate-binding proteins. instead, they consist of a transmembrane substrate-specific s component that interacts with a module composed of a moderately conserved transmembrane (t) component and abc atpases. the majority of s components is considered to act as high-affinity binding proteins that strictly depend on their cognate t and atpase units for transport activity. for a fraction of biotin-specific s units, however, transport activity was demonstrated in their solitary state. here, we compared the activities of nickel- and cobalt-specific ecf transporters in the presence and absence of their t and atpase units. accumulation assays with radioactive metal ions showed that the truncated transporters led to approx. 25% of cell-bound radioactivity compared to the holotransporters. activity of urease, an intracellular nickel-dependent enzyme, was used as a reporter and clearly indicated that the cell-bound radioactivity correlates with the cytoplasmic metal concentration. the results demonstrate that s units of metal transporters not only bind their substrates on the cell surface  but mediate transport across the membrane, a finding of general importance on the way to understand the mechanism of ecf transporters.

(23%) were detected. salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. frequently cultured enterobacteria included escherichia coli (61%), enterococcus  casseiflavus (35%), enterococcus faecalis (35%), enterobacter aerogenes (32%), klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and serratia marcescens (32%). no potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. fecal parasitology revealed infection by protozoophaga sp. (58%), viannella spp. (23%), strongyloides spp. (10%), and ancilostomatidae (10%). a total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), a. dubitatum adults (52%), and a. cajennense adults (5%). the capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, leptospira sp., and toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.

TI  == microwave-assisted synthesis of diverse pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones and their antibacterial activities.
AB  == with the aim of developing a general and practical method for library production, a novel and efficient two-phase microwave-assisted cascade reaction between isatins and beta-ketoamides in [bmim]bf4/toluene was developed for the synthesis  of pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones. the features of this methodology are, the  use of microwave-assisted rapid synthesis, mild reaction conditions, high yields, operational simplicity, facile product separation, and recyclability. furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-dione derivatives produced were evaluated against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes) and gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus). these derivatives showed antibacterial activities against gram-positive strains that were at least equivalent to that against gram-negative strains. compound 7{3,5} displayed the most potent antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa (mic = 0.5 mug/ml) and greater activity than standard ampicillin (mic = 1 mug/ml). compound 7{4,7} exhibited the best inhibitory activity against  e. coli and e. aerogenes (mic = 1 and 0.5 mug/ml), compared with the standard ampicillin (both mics = 1 mug/ml). the synthesized pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones are expected to be widely used as lead compounds for the development of new antibacterial agents.

TI  == molecular characterization of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in northern portugal.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) prevalence was studied in the north of  portugal, among 193 clinical isolates belonging to citizens in a district in the  boundaries between this country and spain from a total of 7529 clinical strains.  in the present study we recovered some members of enterobacteriaceae family, producing esbl enzymes, including escherichia coli (67.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (30.6%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (0.5%), and citrobacter freundii (0.5%). beta -lactamases genes blatem, blashv, and blactx-m  were screened by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing approaches. tem enzymes were among the most prevalent types (40.9%) followed by ctx-m (37.3%) and shv (23.3%). among our sample of 193 esbl-producing strains 99.0% were resistant  to the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. of the 193 isolates 81.3% presented transferable plasmids harboring bla esbl genes. clonal studies were performed by pcr for the enterobacterial repetitive intragenic consensus (eric) sequences. this study reports a high diversity of genetic patterns. ten clusters  were found for e. coli isolates and five clusters for k. pneumoniae strains by means of eric analysis. in conclusion, in this country, the most prevalent type is still the tem-type, but ctx-m is growing rapidly.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of kpc-encoding pkpqil-like plasmids and their distribution in new jersey and new york hospitals.
AB  == the global spread of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) is predominately associated with k. pneumoniae strains genotyped as sequence type 258 (st258). the first st258-associated plasmid, pkpqil, was described in israel in 2006, but its  history in the northeastern united states remains unknown. six pkpqil-like plasmids from four k. pneumoniae isolates (three st258 and one st234), one escherichia coli isolate, and one enterobacter aerogenes isolate, collected from  2003 to 2010 in new york (ny) and new jersey (nj) hospitals, were completely sequenced. the sequences and overall sizes of the six plasmids are highly similar to those of pkpqil; the major difference is that five of six nj/ny strains harbor blakpc-2, while pkpqil contains blakpc-3. moreover, a 26.7-kb fragment was inverted in pkpqil-234 (from st234 k. pneumoniae), while a 14.5-kb region was deleted in pkpqil-ec (from st131 e. coli). pcr screening of 284 other clinical k. pneumoniae isolates identified 101 (35.6%) harboring pkpqil-like plasmids from 9  of 10 surveyed hospitals, demonstrating the wide dissemination of pkpqil in this  region of endemicity. among the positive isolates, 87.1% were typed as st258 and  88.1% carried blakpc-2. the finding of pkpqil-like plasmid in this study from strains that predate the initial report of kpc in israel provides evidence that pkpqil may have originated in the united states. our findings demonstrate that pkpqil plasmids are both spreading clonally in st258 strains and spreading horizontally to different sequence types and species, further highlighting the clinical and public health concerns associated with carbapenem resistance.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == efficacy of commercial natural antimicrobials alone and in combinations against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials  white mustard essential oil (wmeo), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (cfab), olive extract (oe), nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (lae) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. mics of individual and combined antimicrobials against escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were determined at ph 6.0 and 25 degrees c. wmeo was most effective against b. cereus and s. aureus, with mics of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. cfab inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. for  oe, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. lae was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. when wmeo was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for wmeo plus nisaplin and wmeo+oe, which had synergistic activity against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis, respectively. an antagonistic effect was observed for wmeo+cfab against e. aerogenes. for wmeo+lae+cfab, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except s. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. these findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemaseproducing klebsiella pneumoniae of sequence type 258 in michigan, usa.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

TI  == characterization of kpc-2-producing escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a chinese hospital.
AB  == twelve nonduplicated kpc-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three escherichia coli, two citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae, four enterobacter aerogenes, and one klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (march 2011 to september 2012). two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by kpc-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with kpc-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. the majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. most isolates  carried bla(ctx-m) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16s rrna methylases (arma or rmtb). the genetic environment of  bla(kpc-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048, which contains an integration structure of a tn3-based transposon and partial tn4401 segment. inserted fragments (truncated bla(tem)) were detected upstream of the bla(kpc-2) gene for  two e. aerogenes strains. in conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. the outcome of infections caused by kpc-producing enterobacterial isolates and their  mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. the spread of bla(kpc-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in china was  mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the tn3-based transposons and not the bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == a comparative study on phosphotransferase activity of acid phosphatases from raoultella planticola and enterobacter aerogenes on nucleosides, sugars, and related compounds.
AB  == natural and modified nucleoside-5'-monophosphates and their precursors are valuable compounds widely used in biochemical studies. bacterial nonspecific acid phosphatases (nsaps) are a group of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds, and some of them exhibit phosphotransferase activity. nsap containing enterobacter aerogenes and raoultella planticola whole cells were evaluated in the phosphorylation of a wide range of nucleosides and nucleoside precursors using pyrophosphate as phosphate donor. to increase the productivity of the process, we developed two genetically modified strains of escherichia coli which overexpressed nsaps of e. aerogenes and r. planticola. these new recombinant microorganisms (e. coli bl21 pet22b-phoea and e. coli bl21 pet22b-phorp) showed higher activity than the corresponding wild-type strains. reductions in the reaction times from 21 h to 60 min, from 4 h to 15 min, and from 24 h to 40 min in cases of dihydroxyacetone, inosine, and fludarabine, respectively, were obtained.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == enhancement of extracellular pullulanase production from recombinant escherichia  coli by combined strategy involving auto-induction and temperature control.
AB  == pullulanase was extracellularly produced with an engineered escherichia coli with a combined strategy. when auto-induction instead of isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) induction method was implemented, we observed increased extracellular activity (4.2 u ml(-1)) and cell biomass (7.95 g dcw l(-1)). subsequent investigation of temperature effect on fermentation showed cultivation performed at 25 degrees c presented the highest extracellular titer and cell biomass. in order to reduce the extended production period, we developed a two-stage temperature control strategy. its application not only reduced the production period from 72 to 36 h, but also further enhanced the yield of extracellular pullulanase. finally, with a view to releasing more intracellular pullulanase, we altered cell membrane permeability with various medium additives. as a result, extracellular titer was elevated to 68.23 u ml(-1), nearly 35-fold higher than that with iptg induction method. the combined strategy developed here may be useful for the production of other extracellular proteins by recombinant e. coli.

TI  == acanthamoeba castellanii of the t4 genotype is a potential environmental host for enterobacter aerogenes and aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == background: acanthamoeba can interact with a wide range of microorganisms such as viruses, algae, yeasts, protists and bacteria including legionella pneumophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, helicobacter pylori, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium spp., and escherichia coli. in this capacity, acanthamoeba has been suggested as a vector in the transmission of bacterial pathogens to the susceptible hosts. methods: here, we used a keratitis isolate of a. castellanii of the t4 genotype and studied its interactions with two bacterial genera which have not been tested before, enterobacter aerogenes, and aeromonas hydrophila, as well as e. coli. assays were performed to determine bacterial association with and invasion of a. castellanii. additionally, bacterial survival intracellular of a. castellanii trophozoites as well as cysts was determined. results: all three bacterial isolates tested, associated, invaded, and survived inside a. castellanii trophozoites as well as a. castellanii cysts. however, e. aerogenes and e. coli exhibited significantly reduced association with and invasion of a. castellanii as compared with a. hydrophila (p < 0.01 using paired  t-test, one tail distribution). in the long term survival assays, all three bacterial isolates tested remained viable inside a. castellanii trophozoites, while amoeba remained intact; however a. hydrophila exhibited higher survival inside amoebae (14.54 +/- 3.3 bacteria:amoeba ratio) compared with e. aerogenes (3.96 +/- 0.7 bacteria:amoeba ratio) and e. coli (5.85 +/- 1.1 bacteria:amoeba ratio). a. hydrophila, e. coli, and e. aerogenes remained viable during the encystment process and exhibited higher levels of recovery from mature cysts (14.13 +/- 0.89 a. hydrophila:amoeba ratio, 10.13 +/- 1.17 e. aerogenes:amoeba ratio, and 11.95 +/- 0.7 e. coli:amoeba ratio). conclusions: a. hydrophila and e. aerogenes also joined the ranks of other bacteria that could benefit from a. castellanii. because cysts can be airborne, these findings suggest that acanthamoeba is a potential vector in the transmission of a. hydrophila and e. aerogenes to susceptible hosts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == national multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) surveillance in france through the raisin network: a 9 year experience.
AB  == background: in the mid-1990s, the prevalence rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) in french hospitals was high and control of mdrb spread then became a major priority in the national infection control programme (icp). methods: to evaluate the impact of the icp, a national coordination of mdrb surveillance was  set up in 2002. data were collected 3 months a year in healthcare facilities (hcfs) on a voluntary basis. all clinical specimens of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esble) were prospectively included. incidences per 1000 patient days (pds) were calculated and trends in incidence from 2003 to 2010 were assessed. results: participation in the surveillance increased from 478 hcfs in 2002 to 933 in 2010. in 2010, mrsa incidence was 0.40/1000 pds: 1.14 in intensive care units (icus), 0.48 in acute care facilities (acfs) and 0.27 in rehabilitation and long-term care facilities (rltcfs). esble incidence was 0.39/1000 pds: 1.63 in icus, 0.46 in acfs and 0.23 in rltcfs. mrsa incidence significantly decreased from 0.72/1000 pds in 2003 to 0.41/1000 pds in 2010 (p<10(-3)); in contrast, esble incidence significantly increased from 0.17/1000 pds to 0.48/1000 pds (p<10(-3)). the most prevalent esble were enterobacter aerogenes (34%) and escherichia coli (25%) in 2003 and e. coli (60%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (18%) in 2010. conclusion: these results demonstrate the positive impact of the national icp on mrsa rates. in contrast, esble incidence,  especially esbl-producing e. coli, is increasing dramatically and represents a serious threat for hospitals and for the community that deserves specific control actions.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel incompatibility group x3 plasmid carrying bla ndm-1 in enterobacteriaceae isolates with epidemiological links to multiple geographical areas in china.
AB  == the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) is one of the most important resistance traits in enterobacteriaceae. we characterized nine bla ndm-1 producing enterobacteriaceae recovered from seven patients who have recently travelled or been treated in india (n=1) or mainland china (n=6) during december  2010-may 2012. all the china-linked patients had no links to the indian subcontinent. the bla ndm-1 carrying plasmids belonged to the novel incx3 ( approximately 50 kb, in seven isolates including two escherichia coli, two klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one enterobacter aerogenes and one e. cloacae), inca/c2 ( approximately 140 kb, in one e. coli) or fii-f1b groups ( approximately 110 kb, in one e. coli). restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the seven incx3 plasmids revealed identical pattern in six and two bands difference in the remaining one. the incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1 were epidemiologically linked to guangzhou (n=1), hunan (n=4), haifeng  (n=1) and dongguan (n=1) in mainland china. complete sequencing of the incx3 plasmid pndm-hn380 revealed that it was 54 035 bp long and encoded 52 open reading frames. the bla ndm-1 gene was found in a transposon-like structure flanked by isaba125 and is26, inserted into the plasmid genetic load region. the  sequences of the bla ndm-1 containing module within the two is elements were identical to those previously described for bla ndm-1-positive tn125 in the plasmids or chromosome of acinetobacter isolates. in summary, this is the first description of incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1. the findings indicate the worrisome involvement of an epidemic plasmid in the dissemination of ndm-1 in china.

TI  == discovery and biological characterization of geranylated rna in bacteria.
AB  == a general ms-based screen for unusually hydrophobic cellular small molecule-rna conjugates revealed geranylated rna in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica var. typhimurium. the geranyl group is conjugated to the sulfur atom in two 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine nucleotides. these geranylated nucleotides occur in the first anticodon position  of trna(glu)(uuc), trna(lys)(uuu) and trna(gln)(uug) at a frequency of up to 6.7% (~400 geranylated nucleotides per cell). rna geranylation can be increased or abolished by mutation or deletion of the selu (ybbb) gene in e. coli, and purified selu protein in the presence of geranyl pyrophosphate and trna can produce geranylated trna. the presence or absence of the geranyl group in trna(glu)(uuc), trna(lys)(uuu) and trna(gln)(uug) affects codon bias and frameshifting during translation. these rnas represent the first reported examples of oligoisoprenylated cellular nucleic acids.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == comparison of sensing strategies in spr biosensor for rapid and sensitive enumeration of bacteria.
AB  == rapid and sensitive detections of microorganisms are very important for biodefence, food safety, medical diagnosis and pharmaceutics. the present study aims to find out the most proper bioactive surface preparation method to develop  rapid, sensitive and selective bacteria biosensor, based on surface plasmon resonance (spr) spectroscopy. escherichia coli (e. coli) was used as a model bacterium and four sensing strategies in spr were tested. three of these strategies are antibody immobilization methods that are non-specific adsorption,  specific adsorption via the avidin-biotin interaction, and immobilization of antibodies via self-assembled monolayer formation. the fourth strategy is a novel method for bacteria enumeration based on the combination of the spr spectroscopy  and immunomagnetic separation with using gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles. according to results, the most efficient spr method is the one based on gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles. this method allows to specifically separate e. coli from the environment and to quantify rapidly without any labeling procedure. the developed method has a linear range between 30 and 3.0 x 10(4)cfu/ml, and a detection limit of 3 cfu/ml. the selectivity of the method was examined with enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter dissolvens, which did not produce any significant response. the usefulness of the method to detect e. coli  in real water samples was also investigated, and the results were compared with the results from plate-counting method. there was no significant difference between the methods (p>0.05).

AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == development of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of cronobacter muytjensii (formerly called enterobacter sakazakii).
AB  == this study aimed to produce a polyclonal antibody against cronobacter muytjensii  (c. muytjensii, formerly called enterobacter sakazakii) and to develop an immunoassay for its detection. the optimum production of rabbit anti-c. muytjensii immunoglobulin g (igg) and chicken anti-c. muytjensii igy was reached  in weeks 8 and 9, respectively. purification of rabbit anti-c. muytjensii igg from immunized rabbit sera was accomplished using the caprylic acid and ammonium  sulfate precipitation method. as a result, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis produced two bands around 25 and 50 kda, corresponding to a light and a heavy chain, respectively. the optimized conditions for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were using rabbit anti-c. muytjensii igg (1 mug/ml) as a detection antibody and chicken anti-c. muytjensii igy (10 mug/ml) as a capture antibody. in this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed with the other genera of pathogenic bacteria tested, which included escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. the developed assay did not show cross-reactivity with other tested species of cronobacter and enterobacter genera such as c. turicensis, c. sakazakii, e. aerogenes, e. pulveris and e. helveticus. the detection limit of sandwich elisa for c. muytjensii was found to be 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. in addition, detection of c. muytjensii in infant  formula powder showed a low matrix effect on the detection curve of sandwich elisa for c. muytjensii, the detection limit being found to be 6.3 x 10(4) cfu/ml. these findings demonstrate that the developed method is able to detect all strains of c. muytjensii. hence, this elisa technique has potent application  for the rapid and accurate detection of c. muytjensii in dietary foods.

TI  == in vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers. (bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). aim of the study: to investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. materials and methods: methanolic extracts of pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in wistar rats. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. in vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. results: the results indicated that pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the  organisms: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and candida tropicana. during early wound healing phase tnf-alpha and il-6 level were found to be up regulated by pyrostegia venusta treatment. conclusion: increased wound contraction and tensile strength,  augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by  pyrostegia venusta flower extract. induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by pyrostegia venusta extract. results suggest that pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.

TI  == prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: we investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and ampc beta-lactamase in enterobacteriaceae. methods: a total of 347 non-duplicated isolates of enterobacteriaceae were collected between august and october 2006 from 2 hospitals. qnr determinant screening was conducted using pcr amplification, and all positive results were confirmed by direct sequencing. qnr-positive strains were determined on the basis of the presence of esbl and ampc beta-lactamase genes. results: the qnr gene was detected in 47 of 347 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates. among the 47 qnr-positive strains, klebsiella pneumoniae (n=29) was the most common, followed by escherichia coli (n=6), enterobacter cloacae (n=6), citrobacter freundii (n=5), and enterobacter aerogenes (n=1). these isolates were identified as qnra1 (n=6), 8 qnrb subtypes (n=40), and qnrs1 (n=1). at least 1 esbl was detected in 38 of the 47 qnr-positive strains. qnr-positive strains also showed high positive rates of esbl or ampc beta-lactamase, such as tem, shv, ctx-m, and dha. dha-1 was detected in 23 of 47 qnr-positive strains, and this was co-produced with 1 qnra1 and 22 qnrb4. strains harboring mir-1t and cmy were also detected among the qnr-positive strains. antimicrobial-resistance rates of qnr-positive strains to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, and moxifloxacin were 51.1%, 46.8%, 46.8%, 74.5%, and 53.2%, respectively. conclusions: the qnr genes were highly prevalent in enterobacteriaceae, primarily the qnrb subtypes. they were closely associated with ebsl and ampc beta-lactamase.

TI  == genetic characterization of an extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinase with hydrolysing activity against fourth-generation cephalosporins in a clinical isolate of enterobacter aerogenes selected in vivo.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases (esacs) have been reported in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. here,  we characterize a new ampc variant presenting a broadened substrate activity towards fourth-generation cephalosporins, selected in vivo following cefepime treatment for enterobacter aerogenes. methods: two consecutive clonally related isolates of e. aerogenes were evaluated. screening for esac production was performed using plates containing 200 mg/l cloxacillin. mics were determined by microdilution (clsi guidelines). bla(ampc) genes were cloned into a pcr-blunt ii-topo vector and expressed in escherichia coli. the ampc genes were cloned into vector pgex-6p-1 for protein purification. results: isolate ea595 was resistant to two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome; using plates containing cloxacillin, susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime was restored,  suggesting overproduction of the esac beta-lactamase. sequencing identified a new ampc beta-lactamase variant presenting one amino acid substitution, val291gly, inside the h-10 helix. recombinant plasmids harbouring this esac beta-lactamase conferred a broadened resistance profile to cefepime and cefpirome, with resistance levels increasing from 16- to 32-fold in e. coli. ampc-ea595 hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefepime and cefpirome at high levels, presenting a lower k(m) and enabling us to classify the enzyme as an esac. homology modelling suggested that the size of the active site could have increased. conclusions: we  characterized an esac beta-lactamase selected in vivo and conferring a high level of resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins in e. aerogenes. the broadened  spectrum was caused by a new modification to the h-10 helix, which modified the active site.

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines.
AB  == beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta-lactamases, are major resistance mechanisms of enterobacteriaceae. emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) determinants in esbl-producing isolates poses a global threat. the molecular characterisitcs of esbl and pmqr determinants in the philippines are not well characterized. in this study, we investigated esbls and ampc beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines, and analyzed the association between esbl and pmqr genes. a total of 91 amoxicilin non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae  were collected at the research institute for tropical medicine of the philippines from 2006 to 2008. ampc- or esbl-producing isolates were screened by detecting a  zone diameter for cefoxitin </= 14 mm or cefpodoxime </= 20 mm, respectively. possible esbl-producing strains were assessed by the esbl confirmation test of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. pcr and sequencing were performed to detect the esbl and pmqr genes. the number of esbl-producers and ampc-producers confirmed phenotypically was 17 (18.7%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. of 17 phenotypic esbl-producers, 14 isolates had esbl genes, including 6 of escherichia coli, 3 of enterobacter cloacae, 2 of enterobacter aerogenes, 2 of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 of klebsiella ozaenae. among these isolates, there were 13, 4, and 12 with bla(ctx-m), bla(shv), and bla(tem), respectively. of the bla(ctx-m)-positive isolates, bla(ctx-m-15) shows the highest prevalence, followed by bla(ctx-m-3) and bla(ctx-m-14). of 14 esbl-producers identified by pcr, 4, 6, and 7 isolates were positive for qnrb, qnrs, and aac(6')-ib-cr, respectively. the frequency of aac(6')-ib-cr positivity  was significantly higher among ctx-m-15-producing isolates. thus, we identified bla(ctx-m), aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnr in esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from the  philippines, and revealed a significant association between bla(ctx-m-15) and aac(6')-ib-cr. local epidemiological data are important for implementing appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance genes in the philippines will be required.

TI  == essential oils from moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important gram-negative pathogens. use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). the objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. this activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (pabetan). the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in salmonella lps deep-rough mutants. in addition, essential oils of thymus maroccanus and thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. these results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and  may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.

AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
AB  == a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented.  therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems.  leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids  in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin,  kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all  plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion  disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

TI  == natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  == petals of red, yellow and white roses (rosa damascene mill.) of the family rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus), five species of gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (penicillium notatum, aspergillus niger, rhizopus stolonifer, saccharomyces cerevisiae and fusarium oxysporum). all of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. red and yellow petal extracts showed  much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. the fungus, penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. saccharomyces cerevisiae and fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. white roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds  were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (z,z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.

TI  == bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

TI  == deposition behavior of self-assembled monolayers and bacteria on metallic surfaces using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance.
AB  == this paper presents an investigation on the deposition behavior of self-assembled monolayers (sams) and bacteria on titanium and gold surfaces using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (eqcn). the tests included alkanethiol and alkanesilane and three bacteria, namely: e. coli, p. fluorescens and k. aerogenes. the mass change with respect to immersion time was measured by eqcn. the results showed sam formation on both titanium and gold surfaces, but sam formation on gold was generally higher by 26-74% as compared to that of titanium. on the other hand, bacteria also adhered well on the two metal surfaces. e. coli  and p. fluorescens had high affinity on gold and titanium surfaces, respectively, while k. aerogenes was more adherent to titanium. the results showed that titanium and gold are good metals for biomaterials yet at the same time, their bioinert property provide excellent condition for bacterial adhesion. therefore,  there is a need for proper surface preparation to optimize the use of titanium and gold as biomaterials.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == synergistic interaction of phenylpropanoids with antibiotics against bacteria.
AB  == phenylpropanoids constitute a large part of our daily diet and there is a possibility that they might interact with synthetic drugs. the present work was aimed at studying the interaction of seven phenylpropanoids (cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid) with five antibiotics (amikacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and vancomycin) against gram-negative (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. the interaction studies were performed by chequerboard and time-kill curve assays. both assays revealed that cinnamic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most active. they combined synergistically  with the majority of the antibiotics and exhibited enhanced activity against all  the micro-organisms. the time-kill curve parameters were better (p<0.05) for the  combinations of amikacin with ferulic, cinnamic or p-coumaric acid than for the individual treatments. amikacin was the most favourable antibiotic and s. aureus  was the most sensitive microbe to most of the combinations. these phenylpropanoids damaged the bacterial membrane as assessed by the live/dead baclight kit, and structure-activity relationship studies indicated that hydrophilic groups enhanced this activity.

TI  == identification and characterization of a phospholipase a2 from the venom of the saw-scaled viper: novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

TI  == banana peel extract mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles.
AB  == gold nanoparticles were synthesized by using banana peel extract (bpe) as a simple, non-toxic, eco-friendly 'green material'. the boiled, crushed, acetone precipitated, air-dried peel powder was used to reduce chloroauric acid. a variety of nanoparticles were formed when the reaction conditions were altered with respect to ph, bpe content, chloroauric acid concentration and temperature of incubation. the reaction mixtures displayed vivid colors and uv-vis spectra characteristic of gold nanoparticles. dynamic light scattering (dls) studies revealed that the average size of the nanoparticles under standard synthetic conditions was around 300nm. scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (eds) confirmed these results. a coffee ring phenomenon, led to the  aggregation of the nanoparticles into microcubes and microwire networks towards the periphery of the air-dried samples. x-ray diffraction studies of the samples  revealed spectra that were characteristic for gold. fourier transform infra red (ftir) spectroscopy indicated the involvement of carboxyl, amine and hydroxyl groups in the synthetic process. the bpe mediated nanoparticles displayed efficient antimicrobial activity towards most of the tested fungal and bacterial  cultures.

TI  == mutagenesis of klebsiella aerogenes ureg to probe nickel binding and interactions with other urease-related proteins.
AB  == ureg is a gtpase required for assembly of the nickel-containing active site of urease. herein, a strep-tagged klebsiella aerogenes ureg (ureg(str)) and selected site-directed variants of ureg(str) were constructed for studying the in vivo effects on urease activation in recombinant escherichia coli cells, characterizing properties of the purified proteins, and analysis of in vivo and in vitro protein-protein interactions. whereas the strep tag had no effect on ureg's ability to activate urease, enzyme activity was essentially abolished in the k20a, d49a, c72a, h74a, d80a, and s111a ureg(str) variants, with diminished activity also noted with e25a, c28a, and s115a proteins. lys20 and asp49 are likely to function in binding/hydrolysis of gtp and binding of mg, respectively.  ureg(str) binds one nickel or zinc ion per monomer (k(d) approximately 5 microm for each metal ion) at a binding site that includes cys72, as shown by a 12-fold  increased k(d) for nickel ions using c72a ureg(str) and by a thiolate-to-nickel charge-transfer band that is absent in the mutant protein. based on ureg homology to hypb, a gtpase needed for hydrogenase assembly, along with the mutation results, his74 is likely to be an additional metal ligand. in vivo pull-down assays revealed asp80 as critical for stabilizing ureg(str) interaction with the  ureabc-uredf complex. in vitro pull-down assays demonstrated ureg binding to uree, with the interaction enhanced by nickel or zinc ions. the metallochaperone  uree is suggested to transfer its bound nickel to ureg in the ureabc-uredfg complex, with the metal ion subsequently transferring to ured and then into the nascent active site of urease in a gtp-dependent process.

TI  == a highly sensitive detection platform based on surface-enhanced raman scattering  for escherichia coli enumeration.
AB  == a very sensitive and highly specific heterogeneous immunoassay system, based on surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) and gold nanoparticles, was developed for the detection of bacteria and other pathogens. two different types of gold nanoparticles (citrate-stabilized gold nanosphere and hexadecyltrimethylammonium  bromide (ctab)-stabilized gold nanorod particles) were examined and this immunoassay was applied for the detection of escherichia coli. raman labels were  constructed by using these spherical and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles which were first coated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb) and subsequently with a molecular recognizer. the working curve was obtained by plotting the intensity of the sers signal of the symmetric no(2) stretching of dtnb at 1,333 cm(-1) versus the concentration of the e. coli. the analytical performance of gold particles was evaluated via a sandwich immunoassay, and linear calibration graphs were obtained in the e. coli concentration range of 10(1)-10(5) cfu/ml with a 60-s accumulation time. the sensitivity of the raman label fabricated with gold nanorods was more than three times higher than spherical gold nanoparticles. the selectivity of the developed sensor was examined with enterobacter aerogenes  and enterobacter dissolvens, which did not produce any significant response. the  usefulness of the developed immunoassay to detect e. coli in real water samples was also demonstrated.

TI  == characterization of the klebsiella aerogenes urease accessory protein ured in fusion with the maltose binding protein.
AB  == assembly of the klebsiella aerogenes urease metallocenter requires four accessory proteins, ured, uree, uref, and ureg, to effectively deliver and incorporate two  ni2+ ions into the nascent active site of the urease apoprotein (ureabc). each accessory protein has been purified and characterized with the exception of ured  due to its insolubility when it is overproduced in recombinant cells. in this study, a translational fusion was made between the maltose binding protein (mbp)  and ured, with the resulting mbp-ured found to be soluble in escherichia coli cell extracts and able to complement a deltaured-urease cluster in this host microorganism. mbp-ured was purified as a large multimer (> 670 kda) that bound approximately 2.5 ni2+ ions (k(d) of approximately 50 microm, where k(d) is the dissociation constant) per ured protomer according to equilibrium dialysis measurements. zn2+ directly competes with 10-fold higher affinity (approximately  4 zn2+ ions per protomer; k(d) of 5 microm) for the ni2+ binding sites. mbp pulldown experiments demonstrated that the ured domain of mbp-ured formed in vivo complexes with uref, ureg, uref plus ureg, or ureabc when these proteins were overproduced in the same e. coli cells. in addition, a ureabc-(mbp-ured)-urefg complex was observed in cells producing all urease components. comparative in vitro binding experiments with purified proteins demonstrated an approximate 1:1  binding ratio between the ured domain of mbp-ured and the uref domain of the ureef fusion, only weak or transient interaction between mbp-ured and ureg, and no binding with ureabc. these studies are the first to describe the properties of purified ured, and they extend our understanding of its binding partners both in  vitro and in the cell.

AB  == the activities of two naturally occurring compounds, isobavachalcone and diospyrone, against documented strains and multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacterial isolates were evaluated. the results indicated that the two compounds exhibited intrinsic antibacterial activity against several gram-negative bacteria, and their activities were significantly improved in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor (mic values decreased to below 10 microg/ml). in addition, the activities of isobavachalcone and diospyrone against various strains exhibiting deletions of the major efflux pump components (acrab,  tolc) were significantly increased. the overall results indicate that isobavachalcone and diospyrone could be candidates for the development of new drugs against mdr strains and that their use in combination with efflux pump inhibitors reinforces their activity.

AB  == this prospective, observational multicentre (n=24) study investigated relationships between antimicrobial choices and rates of empiric appropriate or adequate therapy, and subsequent adaptation of therapy in 171 icu patients with severe nosocomial infections. appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as in vitro susceptibility of the causative pathogen and clinical response to the agent administered. in non-microbiologically documented infections, therapy was considered adequate in the case of favourable clinical response <5 days. patients had pneumonia (n=127; 66 ventilator-associated), intra-abdominal infection (n=23), and bloodstream infection (n=21). predominant pathogens were pseudomonas  aeruginosa (n=29) escherichia coli (n=26), staphylococcus aureus (n=22), and enterobacter aerogenes (n=21). in 49.6% of infections multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria were involved, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ebsl)-producing  enterobacteriaceae and mdr non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria. prior antibiotic exposure and hospitalisation in a general ward prior to icu admission  were risk factors for mdr. empiric therapy was appropriate/adequate in 63.7% of cases. empiric schemes were classified according to coverage of (i) esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria ("meropenem-based"), (ii) non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (schemes with an  antipseudomonal agent), and (iii) first-line agents not covering esbl-enterobacteriaceae nor non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria. meropenem-based schemes allowed for significantly higher rates of appropriate/adequate therapy (p<0.001). this benefit remained when only patients  without risk factors for mdr were considered (p=0.021). in 106 patients (61%) empiric therapy was modified: in 60 cases following initial inappropriate/inadequate therapy, in 46 patients in order to refine empiric therapy. in this study reflecting real-life practice, first-line use of meropenem provided significantly higher rates of the appropriate/adequate therapy, irrespective of presence of risk factors for mdr.

TI  == method to detect only viable cells in microbial ecology.
AB  == propidium monoazide can limit the analysis of microbial communities derived from  genetic fingerprints to viable cells with intact cell membranes. however, pma treatment cannot completely suppress polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification when the targeted gene is too short. pma treatment in combination with two-step nested pcr was designed to overcome this problem. four experiments  were performed to determine the limitation of pma treatment and to evaluate the suitability of the method by applying the following samples: (1) pure cultures of escherichia coli o157:h7, enterobacter aerogenes, and alcaligenes faecalis; (2) pond water samples spiked with heat-killed e. coli o157:h7 and e. aerogenes; (3)  anaerobic sludge samples exposed to increasing heat stress; and (4) selected natural samples of estuarine sediment and lake mud. results from the first two experiments show that pma treatment cannot efficiently suppress dead cells from pcr amplification when the targeted gene is as short as 190 bp, however, the two-step nested pcr can overcome this problem. the last two experiments indicate  the method that pma treatment in combination with two-step nested pcr is useful for viable cells detection in microbial ecology.

TI  == reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from duganella sp. b2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  == violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and  antifungal activities. however, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. in order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of duganella sp. b2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. the gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from duganella sp. b2, and  three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the t7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter palkb. our results showed that violacein could be  stably synthesized in e. coli, c. freundii, and e. aerogenes. interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant  c. freundii strain reached 1.68 g l(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other  groups. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of pre-cut fruits sold in kano metropolis, kano state, nigeria.
AB  == one hundred and fifty (150) pre-cut fruit samples comprising of pineapples (50),  paw-paw (50) and watermelon (50) at the point of stand retail outlets were tested by standard bacteriological methods to determine bacterial contamination of the fruits. out of these 150 examined 136 (90.67%) were contaminated with bacteria. the bacterial distribution were; escherichia coli 69 (46.00%), staphylococcus aureus 29 (19.33%), salmonella species 13 (8.67%), proteus species 18 (12.00%), enterobacter aerogenes 3 (2.00%), klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1.33%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%). among the 50 pineapple pre-cuts, escherichia coli 26 (17.33%), staphylococcus aureus 6 (4.00%), salmonella species 7 (4.67%), proteus  species 9 (6.00%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%); the 50 watermelon had escherchia coli 22 (14.67%), staphylococcus aureus 13 (8.67%), salmonella species 3 (2.00%), proteus species 5 (3.33%), enterobacter aerogenes 2 (1.33%), klebsiella species 2 (1.33%). of the 50 paw-paw pre-cuts were: escherichia coli 21 (14.00%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (6.67%), salmonella species 3 (2.00%), proteus species 4 (2.67%), enterobacter aerogenes 1 (0.67%) were isolated. the findings in this study have shown that the food vendors failed to adopt adequate  hygiene for food handling and thus, suggest that the quality of all the pre-cut fruits sold at the retail outlets were not bacteriologically satisfactory. the public health risks associated with these pre-cut fruits may suggest that these fruits could serve as the vehicles for foodborne illnesses. this study has shown  the need to educate the vendors on how to protect utensils and fruits to avoid contamination and spoilage.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == genetic structure and distribution of the colibactin genomic island among members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in  escherichia coli. colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. the origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. we therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the enterobacteriaceae by pcr for the presence of this dna element. the island was detected not only in e. coli but also in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter koseri isolates. it was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. in e. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of  phylogenetic group b2 and inserted at the asnw trna locus. interestingly, in k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, c. koseri, and three e. coli strains of phylogenetic group b1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements iceec1 and icekp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. different asn trna genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ice-associated colibactin determinant: asnu in the three e. coli strains of ecor group b1, and different asn trna loci in k. pneumoniae. the detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ice-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == magnetic circular dichroism study of a dicobalt(ii) complex with mixed 5- and 6-coordination: a spectroscopic model for dicobalt(ii) hydrolases.
AB  == the magnetic circular dichroism (mcd) study of [co(2)(mu-oh)(mu-ph(4)dba)(tmeda)(2)(otf)], in which ph(4)dba is the dinucleating bis(carboxylate) ligand dibenzofuran-4,6-bis(diphenylacetate) and tmeda is n,n,n',n'-tetramethylethylenediamine, is presented. this complex serves as an excellent spectroscopic model for a number of dicobalt(ii) enzymes and proteins that have both the mu-hydroxo, mu-carboxylato bridging and asymmetric 6- and 5-coordination. the low-temperature mcd spectrum of the model complex shows bands at 490, 504, and 934 nm arising from d-d transitions on the 6-coordinate co(ii) and bands at 471, 522, 572, 594, and 638 nm arising from d-d transitions on the 5-coordinate co(ii). the most intense mcd bands are at 504 and 572 nm for 6- and  5-coordinate co(ii), respectively, and these two bands are found in the mcd spectra of dicobalt(ii)-substituted methionine aminopeptidase from escherichia coli (cocometap), glycerophosphodiesterase from enterobacter aerogenes (cocogpdq), aminopeptidase from aeromonas proteolytica (cocoaap), and myohemerythrin from themiste zostericola (cocomyohry). these dicobalt(ii)-substituted proteins are known to have one 5- and one 6-coordinate co(ii) bridged by one or two carboxylates and either a water or a hydroxide. the  uncertainty of the bridging water's state of protonation is problematic, as this  is a likely candidate for the attacking nucleophile in the dimetallohydrolases. analysis of the variable-temperature variable-field (vtvh) mcd data determined that the co(ii) ions in the model complex are ferromagnetically coupled with a j  of 3.0 cm(-1). a comparison of all dicobalt(ii) complexes and dicobalt(ii)-substituted protein active sites with the mu-hydroxo/aqua, mu-carboxylato bridging motif reveals that j is either zero or negative (antiferromagnetic) in the mu-aqua systems and positive (ferromagnetic) in the mu-hydroxo systems. it was also determined that the co(ii) ions in cocoaap and cocomyohry are ferromagnetically coupled, each with a j of 3.4 cm(-1), which suggests that these ions have a mu-hydroxo bridging ligand.

AB  == giant scale insects (drosicha: coccoldea: monophlebidae) were investigated for their symbiotic organs and bacterial endosymbionts. two types of bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences, flavobacterial and enterobacterial, were consistently detected in d. corpulenta and d. pinicola. the former sequences formed a compact  clade in the bacteroidetes, allied to the symbionts of cushion and armored scales. the latter sequences formed a robust clade in the gamma-proteobacteria, allied to enteric bacteria like enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli. another type of 16s sequence derived from wolbachia was also detected in d. pinicola. in-situ hybridization demonstrated that the flavobacterial and enterobacterial symbionts were localized in a pair of huge bacteriomes in the abdomen, the former in uninucleated peripheral bacteriocytes and the latter in syncytial central bacteriocytes. electron microscopy confirmed the endocellular locations of the pleomorphic flavobacterial symbiont and the rod-shaped enterobacterial symbiont, and also revealed the location and fine structure of the wolbachia symbiont in d. pinicola. infection frequencies of the flavobacterial and enterobacterial symbionts were consistently 100% in populations of d. corpulenta and d. pinicola, while the wolbachia symbiont exhibited 0% and 100% infection frequencies in d. corpulente and d. pinicola, respectively. neither the flavobacterial symbiont nor the enterobacterial symbiont exhibited at-biased nucleotide composition or accelerated molecular evolution. the huge bacteriomes of drosicha giant scales would provide a useful system for investigating biochemical, physiological, and genomic aspects of the host-symbiont and symbiont-symbiont interactions.

TI  == combining capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection for the analysis of escherichia coli lysates.
AB  == with the goal of improving water quality control, in this study we combined ce-lif for the analysis of escherichia coli lysates under discontinuous conditions. prior to injecting a large-volume protein sample, a plug of 0.2% w/v  sds was injected into the capillary filled with 2.0 m tris-borate (tb) solution (ph 10.3). during the courses of the process stacking, proteins migrated against  the electroosmotic flow (eof) and entered a 1.7% w/v poly(ethylene oxide) solution that has been prepared in 200 mm tb (ph 9.0). the stacked proteins were  then separated through sieving and then detected at the cathodic end. the use of  tb solutions containing 0.01% w/v poly(ethylene oxide) was essential for the preparation of the protein samples and e. coli lysates to minimize the extent of  protein adsorption on the capillary wall. under the optimized ce-lif conditions,  we detected beta-galactosidase with and without concentration at levels as low as 0.23 and 7.52 nm, respectively. our approach allowed the detection of 3 x 10(2) e. coli cells based on the characteristic peaks of its lysates; in addition, we could detect the presence of 20 e. coli cells in a 50 ml sample of pond water within 24 h. in terms of the analyte migration time, the relative standard deviation of this ce-lif method was less than 1.3%. we also extended the practicality of this technique by applying it to the separation of mixtures of e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella enterica.

AB  == in most rural and urban settlements, particularly in nigeria, wells, spring, streams or rivers and lakes serves as major sources of water supply for drinking  and other domestic purposes. unfortunately, many of the available water sources are not potable without some form of treatment which is seldom available in most  settings. the use of untreated surface water sources for drinking and for domestic purposes remains a major threat to public health as these could serve as reservoirs the for transfer of antibiotic resistant pathogens. the incidence of resistant bacteria isolated from surface and underground water in six rural settlements in ekiti state nigeria was thus investigated. gram-negative bacteria  were isolated from wells, streams and boreholes in six rural settlements in ekiti state nigeria between january and april, 2006 and the prevalence of organisms exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, nitofurantoin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin was observed. gram-negative bacterial isolates comprised escherichia coli (22.7%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.5%), salmonella spp. (13.3%), shigella spp. (19.3%), proteus spp. (18.5%), klebsiella spp. (19.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%).  over 10% of the bacteria were resistant to four or more antibiotic. antibiotic resistance was highest in members of the genera enterobacter, pseudomonas, and proteus. given the prevalence of appalling sanitary facilities and inappropriate  public antibiotic use, the possibility of antibiotic resistance selection, faecal dissemination and subsequent contamination of local water sources available for rural residents of the developing world is highlighted. the implication for clinical practice of infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains especially among immunodeficient individuals is also discussed.

TI  == how beta-lactam antibiotics enter bacteria: a dialogue with the porins.
AB  == background: multi-drug resistant (mdr) infections have become a major concern in  hospitals worldwide. this study investigates membrane translocation, which is the first step required for drug action on internal bacterial targets. beta-lactams,  a major antibiotic class, use porins to pass through the outer membrane barrier of gram-negative bacteria. clinical reports have linked the mdr phenotype to altered membrane permeability including porin modification and efflux pump expression. methodology/principal findings: here influx of beta-lactams through the major enterobacter aerogenes porin omp36 is characterized. conductance measurements through a single omp36 trimer reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer allowed us to count the passage of single beta-lactam molecules. statistical analysis of each transport event yielded the kinetic parameters of antibiotic travel through omp36 and distinguishable translocation properties of beta-lactams were quantified for ertapenem and cefepime. expression of omp36 in an otherwise porin-null bacterial strain is shown to confer increases in the killing rate of these antibiotics and in the corresponding bacterial susceptibility. conclusions/significance: we propose the idea of a molecular "passport" that allows rapid transport of substrates through porins. deciphering  antibiotic translocation provides new insights for the design of novel drugs that may be highly effective at passing through the porin constriction zone. such data may hold the key for the next generation of antibiotics capable of rapid intracellular accumulation to circumvent the further development mdr infections.

TI  == biological activity of alkaloids from solanum dulcamara l.
AB  == alkaloids are well known for their antimicrobial activity. though all natural alkaloids come from plants, not all plants produce alkaloids. plants of the solanaceae family are known for their high alkaloid content. alkaloids are found  in all plant parts like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. in the present study, those plant parts of solanum dulcamara were selected which have been reported to produce a high content of a specific alkaloid: solanine (from unripe fruits), solasodine (from flowers) and beta-solamarine (from roots). these alkaloids were extracted from various parts of s. dulcamara by well-established methods and were screened for their antibacterial activity. human pathogenic bacteria, viz., enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus,  were selected for the study. all three alkaloids inhibited the growth of e. coli  and s. aureus. however, no significant activity was observed against e. aerogenes. minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were also evaluated.

TI  == novel ctx-m {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of enterobacteriaceae in changsha, southern china.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  ctx-m and shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genotypes in enterobacteriaceae from hunan province, china. methods: clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in changsha, hunan province, were collected between october 2004 and july 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv) were determined. random amplified polymorphic dna was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. results: the overall rate of esbl-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). the dominant esbls were ctx-m types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris and providencia stuartii. the most common bla(ctx-m) genotypes were bla(ctx-m-14) (47.7%), bla(ctx-m-3) (29.4%) and bla(ctx-m-15) (17.4%). a novel gene derived from bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-82) (ala-40-->pro), was identified. conclusions: the dominant esbl genotype in hunan province was bla(ctx-m). the high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(ctx-m-15) has not previously been reported from china. our results identify that an epidemic of bla(ctx-m) in changsha, hunan province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(ctx-m-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-3.) the worldwide dominance of bla(ctx-m-15) could be poised to spread to china, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.

TI  == role of tolc in klebsiella oxytoca resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == objectives: the gram-negative human pathogen klebsiella oxytoca is often resistant to several antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and others. the aim of this study was to look at the mechanisms leading to this resistance and particularly the role of tolc and efflux mechanisms in determining resistance. methods: ciprofloxacin accumulation  was measured spectrofluorometrically. growth inhibition assays were performed in  the presence or absence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (10 mg/l, final concentration). the genome of k. oxytoca was analysed for the existence of  loci encoding tolc by pcr using primers for the enterobacter aerogenes tolc gene  and subsequently sequenced. a plasmid named puc18tolc was constructed and inserted into escherichia coli c600tolc,tn5, and the function of tolc was analysed. the structure modelling was performed using the modeller program. results: the existence of the acrab efflux mechanism was demonstrated in the species, and a tolc-like protein, a channel-forming protein at the external membrane that allows the extrusion of antibiotics by the acrab efflux pump, was cloned, sequenced and a model proposed. conclusions: k. oxytoca express a functional tolc that lacks a fragment of six amino acids characteristic of the external loops of tolc in e. coli. this makes this species resistant to a few colicins.

TI  == isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from raphanus sativus l.
AB  == acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and  resistant pathogens, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. total and individual isothiocyanate (itc) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of r. sativus were also evaluated. both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. of the different parts of r. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different itcs such as allyl isothiocyanate (aitc), phenyl isothiocyanate (pitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (mtbitc) in different parts of the plant. the low linear correlation between the total itc content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of r. sativus was not dependent on the total itc content. however, the antibacterial activity of r. sativus was well correlated with aitc, pitc, and bitc for all organisms except for enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to mtbitc.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == identification and evolution of drug efflux pump in clinical enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in 1995 and 2003.
AB  == background: the high mortality impact of infectious diseases will increase due to accelerated evolution of antibiotic resistance in important human pathogens. development of antibiotic resistance is a evolutionary process inducing the erosion of the effectiveness of our arsenal of antibiotics. resistance is not necessarily limited to a single class of antibacterial agents but may affect many unrelated compounds; this is termed 'multidrug resistance' (mdr). the major mechanism of mdr is the active expulsion of drugs by bacterial pumps; the treatment of gram negative bacterial infections is compromised due to resistance  mechanisms including the expression of efflux pumps that actively expel various usual antibiotics (beta-lactams, quinolones, ...). methodology/principal findings: enterobacter aerogenes has emerged among enterobacteriaceae associated  hospital infections during the last twenty years due to its faculty of adaptation to antibiotic stresses. clinical isolates of e. aerogenes belonging to two strain collections isolated in 1995 and 2003 respectively, were screened to assess the involvement of efflux pumps in antibiotic resistance. drug susceptibility assays  were performed on all bacterial isolates and an efflux pump inhibitor (pabetan) previously characterized allowed to decipher the role of efflux in the resistance. accumulation of labelled chloramphenicol was monitored in the presence of an energy poison to determine the involvement of active efflux on the antibiotic intracellular concentrations. the presence of the pabetan-susceptible  efflux system was also identified in resistant e. aerogenes strains. conclusions/significance: for the first time a noticeable increase in clinical isolates containing an efflux mechanism susceptible to pump inhibitor is report within an 8 year period. after the emergence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in e. aerogenes and the recent characterisation of porin mutations in clinical isolates, this study describing an increase in inhibitor-susceptible efflux throws light on a new step in the evolution of mechanism in e. aerogenes.

TI  == membrane permeability and regulation of drug "influx and efflux" in enterobacterial pathogens.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae, membrane permeability is a key in the level of susceptibility to antibiotics. modification of the bacterial envelope by decreasing the porin production or increasing the expression of efflux pump systems has been reported. these phenomena are frequently associated with other resistance mechanisms such as alteration of antibiotics or modification of the drug targets, in various clinical isolates showing a multi drug resistant phenotype (mdr). in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica several genes and external factors are involved in the emergence of mdr isolates. these bacterial isolates exhibit a noticeable reduction of functional porins per cell due to a decrease, a complete  shutdown of synthesis, or the expression of an altered porin and a high expression of efflux systems (e.g. overexpression of the pump). the combined action of these mechanisms during an infection confers a significant decrease in  bacterial sensitivity to antibiotherapy ensuring dissemination and colonization of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. mara and rama are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in the triggering of the mdr phenotype. mutations in regulator genes have been shown to induce the overproduction of efflux and the down-regulation of porin synthesis. in addition, various compounds such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the mdr response. this phenomenon has been observed both in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and in vivo during antibiotic treatment of infected patients. these effectors activate the expression of specific global regulators, mara, rama, or target other genes located downstream  in the regulation cascade.

AB  == background: the beta-lactamase landscape is changing radically, with ctx-m types  now the most prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) worldwide, except maybe in the usa. in addition, there are growing numbers of enterobacteriaceae with kpc and metallo-carbapenemases. we examined whether combinations of oxyimino-cephalosporins with nxl104, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, overcame these resistances. methods: nxl104 was tested  at 4 mg/l in combination with cefotaxime and ceftazidime versus: (i) escherichia  coli transconjugants and wild-type enterobacteriaceae with ctx-m esbls; (ii) enterobacteriaceae with ertapenem resistance contingent on combinations of impermeability and esbls or ampc; and (iii) enterobacteriaceae with kpc, sme, metallo- or oxa-48 carbapenemases. results: mics of cefotaxime + nxl104 were < or = 1 mg/l for most enterobacteriaceae with ctx-m, kpc or oxa-48 enzymes and were < or = 2 mg/l for those that also had ertapenem resistance contingent on combinations of beta-lactamase and impermeability. mics of the ceftazidime + nxl104 combination were < or = 4 mg/l, except for a single enterobacter aerogenes with kpc and ampc enzymes together with porin loss, which required an mic of 32 mg/l. the major gap was that nxl104 could not potentiate cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae with imp or vim metallo-enzymes. conclusions: oxyimino-cephalosporin + nxl104 combinations have potential against strains with  the prevalent esbls and non-metallo-carbapenemases.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in  combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml)  and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to  reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and synergism of some substituted flavonoids.
AB  == natural and synthetic substituted chalcones, flavones and flavanones were tested  for antibacterial activity. in order to determine synergism, new combinations of  substituted flavonoids against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes were assayed. the results allow us to establish relationships between antimicrobial effect of the compounds and membrane structures of these microorganisms. when flavonoid combinations were employed a stronger effect was found against e. coli than against s. aureus. this fact is due to the existence of porins in the outer membrane of g(-)-bacteria. the compound that acts as enhancer acts by blocking the charges of amino acids in the porins and thus facilitates the passage of the other compound by diffusion into the bacterial cell.

TI  == occurrence of esbl & amp-c beta-lactamases & susceptibility to newer antimicrobial agents in complicated uti.
AB  == background & objective: production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta-lactamases are the most common mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacilli. a prospective study was undertaken to know the occurrence of esbl and ampc producing strains and their antibiotic susceptibilities to newer agents to guide empirical therapy for complicated urinary tract infections. methods: over a period of five months (january to may 2003), organisms grown in pure culture and in significant numbers from urine sample were identified by standard biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility determined by disc diffusion method. gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to third generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin/amikacin were defined as highly drug resistant uropathogens (hdru). hdru were further tested for esbl and ampc phenotypes. results: uropathogens were isolated in significant numbers in 1979 (21.8%) of the total 9,072 samples, of which 438(22.1%) were hdru. two hundred and five consecutive hdru isolates were tested for esbl production and 36.5 per cent were found to be esbl producers. the highest positivity was found to be in klebsiella spp. (51.2%), followed by escherichia coli (40.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (33.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.9%). both esbl producers and non producers showed a high degree resistance to piperacillin (93.1 and 90.9%), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (93.4 and 90.9%), aztreonam (79.4 and 78%), cefepime (76.7 and 78%), and ampicillin-sulbactam (76.7 and 70.4%). the most effective antibiotics for esbl producers were imipenem (8.2% resistance), piperacillin-tazobactam (9.5%) and ceftazidime-clavulanic acid (23.2%). among esbl non-producers, piperacillin-tazobactam (31.06%), ceftazidime-clavulanic acid (49.2%) and imipenem (11%) were less effective when compared to esbl producers. fifty three piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam positive and 20 negative isolates were further tested for ampc production and found that all 53 positive isolates were also positive by for ampc beta-lactamase. interpretation & conclusion: overall, 22.1 per cent of our isolates were highly drug resistant, and esbl producers could explain only 36.5 per cent of hdru in our study. therefore, we assume that  ampc beta-lactamases are more important in our setting. based on our finding a test using discs containing piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam ( ptpc) disc at a distance of 20 mm would act as a useful screening procedure for ampc production as ampc beta-lactamase producers are more susceptible to tazobactam as compared to clavulanic acid.

TI  == viper metalloproteinase (agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pola52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

TI  == e240v substitution increases catalytic efficiency toward ceftazidime in a new natural tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, tem-149, from enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens clinical isolates.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize a novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase that belongs to the tem family, the tem-149 enzyme, and that was isolated from the urine of two hospitalized patients from different hospitals in  southern italy. the peculiarity of this enzyme was the finding of a valine residue at position 240. the array of amino acid substitutions found in tem-149 was as follows: e104k, r164s, m182t, and e240v. a reversion of a threonine residue at position 182 was also performed to create a new mutant, tem-149 t182m, in order to assess the contribution of this substitution on the kinetic profile and the stability of tem-149. the bla tem-149 and bla tem-149/t182m genes were cloned into pbc-sk, and the corresponding enzymes were purified from recombinant  escherichia coli hb101 by the same procedure. both enzymes hydrolyzed all beta-lactams tested, with a preference for ceftazidime, which was found to be the best substrate. by comparison of the kinetic parameters of the tem-149 and the tem-149 t182m enzymes, a reduction of the catalytic efficiency for the tem-149 t182m mutant was observed against all substrates tested except benzylpenicillin,  cefotaxime, and aztreonam. tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam were good inhibitors of the tem-149 beta-lactamase.

AB  == objectives: to assess the frequency and diversity of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in the champagne-ardenne region france, and to identify genetic elements associated with the bla(ctx-m) genes. methods: during 2004, all  the non-duplicate isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii  resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime, screening samples excluded, were collected in 10 public hospitals and 3 private clinics. bla genes were sequenced and bla(ctx-m) environment characterized by pcr mapping. results: in enterobacteriaceae (138/21  861; 0.6%), esbls were predominantly tem-24 (n = 52; 37.7%) and ctx-m-15 (n = 37; 26.8%). three new enzymes were identified, ctx-m-61 (ctx-m-1 group), tem- and shv-type. a. baumannii (n = 5) produced veb-1 and p. aeruginosa (n = 2) shv-2a. isecp1 was detected in 22/27 strains, disrupted in 7 of them. the is903-like element was downstream of bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-16). iscr1 was found upstream of bla(ctx-m-2) and bla(ctx-m-9), and iscr1 and bla(ctx-m-2) were located on a sul1-type class 1 integron. in comparison with 2001-02, esbl distribution among enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in ctx-m-type (44.9% vs  3.7% p < 10(-7)) due to escherichia coli ctx-m-15 and to the almost total disappearance of tem-3 (0.9% vs 51.2%). e. coli was the most frequent species (50.0% vs 5.1% in 1998) despite a similar prevalence to that in 1998 (0.5% vs 0.2%). conclusions: a careful detection of bla(ctx-m)-type spread to other species would help to anticipate clonal endemics such as those observed in enterobacter aerogenes tem-24.

AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == characterization of a phosphodiesterase capable of hydrolyzing ea 2192, the most  toxic degradation product of the nerve agent vx.
AB  == glycerophosphodiesterase (gpdq) from enterobacter aerogenes is a nonspecific diesterase that enables escherichia coli to utilize alkyl phosphodiesters, such as diethyl phosphate, as the sole phosphorus source. the catalytic properties of  gpdq were determined, and the best substrate found was bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate with a kcat/km value of 6.7 x 10(3) m-1 s-1. in addition, the e. aerogenes diesterase was tested as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of a series of phosphonate monoesters which are the hydrolysis products of the highly toxic organophosphonate nerve agents sarin, soman, gf, vx, and rvx. among the phosphonate monoesters tested, the hydrolysis product of rvx, isobutyl methyl phosphonate, was the best substrate with a kcat/km value of 33 m-1 s-1. the ability of gpdq to hydrolyze the phosphonate monoesters provides an alternative selection strategy in the search of enhanced variants of the bacterial phosphotriesterase (pte) for the hydrolysis of organophosphonate nerve agents. this investigation demonstrated that the previously reported activity of gpdq toward the hydrolysis of methyl demeton-s is due to the presence of a diester contaminant in the commercial material. furthermore, it was shown that gpdq is capable of hydrolyzing a close analogue of ea 2192, the most toxic and persistent degradation product of the nerve agent vx.

TI  == the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria.
AB  == most bacteria possess the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase, which is used to produce branched-chain amino acids. enteric bacteria contain several isozymes suited to different conditions, but the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria is largely unknown. growth experiments confirmed that escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes contain isozymes of acetohydroxyacid synthase, allowing the bacteria to grow in the presence of valine (which causes feedback inhibition of ahas i) or the sulfonylurea herbicide triasulfuron (which inhibits ahas ii) although a slight lag phase was observed in growth in the latter case. several common soil isolates were inhibited by triasulfuron, but pseudomonas fluorescens and rhodococcus erythropolis were not inhibited by any combination of triasulfuron and valine. the extent of sulfonylurea-sensitive acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil was revealed when 21 out of 27 isolated bacteria in pure culture were inhibited by triasulfuron, the addition of isoleucine and/or valine reversing the effect in 19 cases. primers were designed to target the genes encoding the large  subunits (ilvb, ilvg and ilvi) of acetohydroxyacid synthase from available sequence data and a approximately 355 bp fragment in bacillus subtilis, arthrobacter globiformis, e. coli and s. enterica was subsequently amplified. the primers were used to create a small clone library of sequences from an agricultural soil. phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequence variation, but all 19 amino acid sequences were most closely related to published large subunit acetohydroxyacid synthase amino acid sequences within several phyla including the proteobacteria and actinobacteria. the results suggested the majority of soil microorganisms contain only one functional acetohydroxyacid synthase enzyme sensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides.

TI  == substrate specificity of the oqxab multidrug resistance pump in escherichia coli  and selected enteric bacteria.
AB  == objectives: a plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, oqxab, identified in escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against  selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. the ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. methods: the mics of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic e. coli strains, except for the presence  of the oqxab operon. a derivative of the plasmid encoding oqxab (pola52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. the effect  of the presence of the oqxab pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. results: the oqxab pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in e. coli. these included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pola52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. conclusions: the plasmid-encoded oqxab pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. these results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.

TI  == inhibition of hydrogen uptake in escherichia coli by expressing the hydrogenase from the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803.
AB  == background: molecular hydrogen is an environmentally-clean fuel and the reversible (bi-directional) hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 as well as the native escherichia coli hydrogenase 3 hold great promise  for hydrogen generation. these enzymes perform the simple reaction 2h+ + 2e- <--> h2 (g). results: hydrogen yields were enhanced up to 41-fold by cloning the bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hoxefuyh) from the cyanobacterium into e. coli. using an optimized medium, e. coli cells expressing hoxefuyh also produced  twice as much hydrogen as the well-studied enterobacter aerogenes hu-101, and hydrogen gas bubbles are clearly visible from the cultures. overexpression of hoxu alone (small diaphorase subunit) accounts for 43% of the additional hydrogen produced by hoxefuyh. in addition, hydrogen production in e. coli mutants with defects in the native formate hydrogenlyase system show that the cyanobacterial hydrogenase depends on both the native e. coli hydrogenase 3 as well as on its maturation proteins. hydrogen absorption by cells expressing hoxefuyh was up to 10 times lower than cells which lack the cloned cyanobacterial hydrogenase; hence, the enhanced hydrogen production in the presence of hoxefuyh is due to inhibition of hydrogen uptake activity in e. coli. hydrogen uptake by cells expressing hoxefuyh was suppressed in three wild-type strains and in two hyce mutants but not in a double mutant defective in hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2;  hence, the active cyanobacterial locus suppresses hydrogen uptake by hydrogenase  1 and hydrogenase 2 but not by hydrogenase 3. differential gene expression indicated that overexpression of hoxefuyh does not alter expression of the native e. coli hydrogenase system; instead, biofilm-related genes are differentially regulated by expression of the cyanobacterial enzymes which resulted in 2-fold elevated biofilm formation. this appears to be the first enhanced hydrogen production by cloning a cyanobacterial enzyme into a heterologous host. conclusion: enhanced hydrogen production in e. coli cells expressing the cyanobacterial hoxefuyh is by inhibiting hydrogen uptake of both hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2.

TI  == frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  == an increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. the tendency of patients in this population to acquire uti is not  completely understood. we aimed at investigating the incidence of uti in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. on admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of uti. serum biochemistry,  complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. ten  of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic uti. urine cultures revealed e. coli in five (50%), klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. the etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with uti were ba in five, pfic in three, wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. we found a significantly greater number of utis in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). the mean age of the patients with uti was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without uti (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, alt, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with uti than in those without uti. there were no significant differences between the groups with  regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, ast, ggt, bun, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and peld scores. in patients with bacteriuria, renal usg revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with uti. vcug demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. in conclusion, symptomatic uti is common in children with cirrhosis. it occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. in febrile children with chronic liver disease, uti should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

AB  == aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis  venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order  of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

AB  == this research was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer on hands contaminated with a nonpathogen surrogate for escherichia coli o157:h7, where the source of the contamination was frozen hamburger patties. a nonpathogenic nalidixic acid-resistant food-grade strain of enterobacter aerogenes was used to inoculate frozen hamburger patties composed of 76% lean beef and 24% fat. thirty-two individuals participated to produce the data used in this study. each participant handled nine patties at least three times, a sample  for microbiological analysis was collected from the surface of one hand, the participant sanitized both hands, and a sample was collected from the other hand. burger handling created perceptible and visible food debris on the hands of most  participants. computer simulations also were used to perform a variety of risk calculations. the average reduction in bacteria from the use of sanitizer on hands contaminated by frozen burgers containing e. aerogenes was 2.6 +/- 0.7 log  cfu per hand. an experiment designed to simultaneously test the effect of sanitizer on e. aerogenes and e. coli o157:h7 also revealed no significant difference in sanitizer effectiveness against the two organisms. the results of the real-world risk estimation calculations (using the actual prevalence and concentration of e. coli o157:h7 in ground beef) predict that once in 1 million trials, a single pathogen cell will be transferred to a single lettuce piece. the effectiveness of this sanitizer intervention was similar to that for hand washing and glove use previously reported. the person-to-person microbial reduction variability from sanitizer use is similar to published data for glove use and was less variable than published data on hand washing effectiveness.

TI  == the ureef fusion protein provides a soluble and functional form of the uref urease accessory protein.
AB  == four accessory proteins (ured, uree, uref, and ureg) are typically required to form the nickel-containing active site in the urease apoprotein (ureabc). among the accessory proteins, ured and uref have been elusive targets for biochemical and structural characterization because they are not overproduced as soluble proteins. using the best-studied urease system, in which the klebsiella aerogenes genes are expressed in escherichia coli, a translational fusion of uree and uref  was generated. the ureef fusion protein was overproduced as a soluble protein with a convenient tag involving the his-rich region of uree. the fusion protein was able to form a ured(ef)g-ureabc complex and to activate urease in vivo, and it interacted with ured-ureabc in vitro to form a ured(ef)-ureabc complex. while  the uref portion of ureef is fully functional, the fusion significantly affected  the role of the uree portion by interrupting its dimerization and altering its metal binding properties compared to those of the wild-type uree. analysis of a series of ureef deletion mutants revealed that the c terminus of uref is required to form the ured(ef)g-ureabc complex, while the n terminus of uref is essential for activation of urease.

TI  == intracellular accumulation of linezolid in escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized  that the poor activity of linezolid in gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. methods: using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae. we included test strains with enhanced rnd-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp), an efflux pump inhibitor. results: consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. the accumulation levels in test strains of e. coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin y accumulation. conclusions: the intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing 6,5 bicyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: evidence for 1,4-thiazepine intermediates with c7 r stereochemistry by computational methods.
AB  == the design and synthesis of a series of 6-methylidene penems containing [6,5]-fused bicycles (thiophene, imidazole, or pyrazle-fused system) as novel class a, b, and c beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. these penems proved to  be potent inhibitors of the tem-1 (class a) and ampc (class c) beta-lactamases and less so against the class b metallo-beta-lactamase ccra. their in vitro and in vivo activities in combination with piperacillin are discussed. on the basis of the crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 2 with shv-1 (class a) and gc1 (class c) enzymes, compounds 14a-l were designed and synthesized. penems are proposed to form a seven-membered 1,4 thiazepine ring in  both class a and c beta-lactamases. the interaction energy calculation for the enzyme-bound intermediates favor the formation of the c7 r enantiomer over the s  enantiomer of the 1,4-thiazepine in both beta-lactamases, which is consistent with those obtained from the crystal structure of 2 with shv-1 and gc1.

TI  == antifungal and antibacterial activities of mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida).
AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == surrogates for validation of electron beam irradiation of foods.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify a potential surrogate to describe the radiation sensitivity of the most common pathogens encountered in fruits. three pathogens: escherichia coli o157:h7 933, listeria monocytogenes atcc 51414, and salmonella poona, and five non-pathogens: e. coli k-12 mg1655, listeria innocua seeliger 1983 (nrrl b-33003 and nrrl b-33014), enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella lt2 were inoculated (populations of 10(7)-10(9) cfu/ml) into model food systems (10% w/w gelatin) and exposed to doses up to 1.0 kgy using a 2 mev van der graaf linear accelerator. the non-pathogen e. coli k-12 mg1655 was highly resistant to radiation (d(10)=0.88 kgy) in comparison to the other strains while  l. monocytogenes was the more radiation-resistant pathogen (d(10)=1.09 kgy). thus, e. coli k-12 mg1655 could be a suitable surrogate for e-beam studies with l. monocytogenes as the indicator pathogen. l. innocua strains were more radiation-sensitive (d(10)=0.66, 0.72 kgy) than their pathogenic counterpart. s.  poona and e. coli o157:h7 were even more radiation-sensitive (d(10)=0.38, 0.36 kgy, respectively). s. lt2 was the least radiation-resistant pathogen with d(10)=0.12 kgy. in a later study, the radiation resistance of the pathogens and the surrogate was evaluated when inoculated in a real food (i.e., fresh cantaloupe). the d(10) values obtained in this experiment were higher than those  obtained with the model foods. however, the surrogate was still more radiation-resistant and could therefore be used to indicate decontamination of the target pathogens under electron beam irradiation.

AB  == objectives: in order to characterize the mechanism involved in parabens resistance, we studied 13 enterobacter gergoviae collected from diverse cosmetic  formulations containing parabens as preservatives and 10 isolates from clinical or industrial sources. methods: rapd and eric-pcr were employed and compared for  the epidemiological typing. to study antibiotic and paraben susceptibility, the standard disc diffusion method and the 2-fold dilution method in luria-bertani medium were used. characterization of porins was performed using immunodetection  with polyclonal antibodies. resistance mechanisms against parabens membrane permeabilization were evaluated by measuring k(+) efflux using a specific electrode. mar regulon identification and comparison were carried out. results: epidemiological typing confirmed that most of the cosmetic formulations were contaminated by unrelated strains. all of the e. gergoviae strains presented high methylparaben mics, ranging from 1 to 3.8 g/l, values that were 2-5 times higher  than for escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes, even in strains overexpressing mara. these mics decreased in the presence of phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide, pinpointing efflux as a major mechanism of parabens  resistance even in e. gergoviae clinical strains. conclusions: this is the first  report showing the role of active efflux in the parabens resistance in e. gergoviae, a mechanism that may explain its frequent isolation in parabens-containing cosmetics compared with other enterobacterial species. paraben efflux seems to be regulated by a mar-independent process in e. gergoviae.

TI  == induction by klebsiella aerogenes of a melanin-like pigment in cryptococcus neoformans.
AB  == while studying the interaction of cryptococcus neoformans with dictyostelium discoideum, we noticed that yeast colonies in agar with a feeder lawn of klebsiella aerogenes were brown. this finding was intriguing because c. neoformans colonies are not pigmented unless they are provided with precursors for melanization. strains of all c. neoformans serotypes produced brown pigment in response to k. aerogenes at 22, 30, and 37 degrees c. pigment production required fungal laccase and was suppressed by high concentrations of glucose. treatment of brown cells with guanidinium isothiocyanate and hot concentrated hcl yielded particulate material that had the physical and chemical characteristics of melanins. no pigment formation was observed when c. neoformans was exposed to  live escherichia coli or heat-killed k. aerogenes. analysis of k. aerogenes supernatants revealed the presence of dopamine, which can be a substrate for melanin synthesis by c. neoformans. our findings illustrate a remarkable interaction between a pathogenic fungus and a gram-negative bacterium, in which the bacterium produces a substrate that promotes fungal melanization. this observation provides a precedent that could explain the source of a substrate for c. neoformans melanization in the environment.

AB  == objectives: 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp) has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance (mdr) in escherichia coli overexpressing rnd type efflux pumps, but there is no data on its activity in enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli. methods: the antimicrobial susceptibilities of laboratory strains and 167 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae to a variety of antimicrobial agents were determined in the absence and presence of nmp and, for comparison, of phe-arg-beta-naphthylamide (pabetan), another putative efflux pump inhibitor (epi). a 4-fold or greater reduction of the mic after epi addition was considered significant. results: nmp consistently reduced the mic of linezolid in citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. significant effects of nmp addition in >50% of tested isolates were also seen for levofloxacin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol in e. aerogenes, and for levofloxacin and tetracycline in k. pneumoniae, whereas no or minor effects were observed in serratia marcescens. mdr reversal by nmp was more likely in isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. in most fluoroquinolone-resistant strains the activity was sufficient to render isolates  drug-susceptible at clinically achievable concentrations. the activity of pabetan was different from that of nmp, suggesting different modes of action of the two putative epis. conclusion: nmp has moderate activity in reversing mdr in many but not all members of the enterobacteriaceae family including clinical isolates. its effects on resistance reversal depend on bacterial species and drug, and are different from those seen with pabetan.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == acid phosphatase/phosphotransferases from enteric bacteria.
AB  == we have investigated the enzymatic phosphorylation of nucleosides and found that  morganella morganii phoc acid phosphatase exhibits regioselective pyrophosphate (pp(i))-nucleoside phosphotransferase activity. in this study, we isolated genes  encoding an acid phosphatase with regioselective phosphotransferase activity (ap/ptase) from providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia blattae and klebsiella planticola, and compared the primary structures and enzymatic characteristics of these enzymes with those of ap/ptase (phoc acid phosphatase) from m. morganii. the enzymes were highly homologous in primary structure with m. morganii ap/ptase, and are classified as class a1 acid phosphatases. the synthesis of inosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-imp) by e. coli overproducing each acid phosphatase was investigated. the p. stuartii enzyme, which is most closely related to the m. morganii enzyme, exhibited high 5'-imp productivity, similar to the m. morganii enzyme. the 5'-imp productivities of the e. aerogenes, e. blattae and k. planticola enzymes were inferior to those of the former two enzymes. this  result underlines the importance of lower k(m) values for efficient nucleotide production. as these enzymes exhibited a very high degree of homology at the amino acid sequence level, it is likely that local sequence differences in the binding pocket are responsible for the differences in the nucleoside-pp(i) phosphotransferase reaction.

TI  == clinical and molecular analysis of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in the community setting.
AB  == during a previous survey, five extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing  enterobacteria (esble) (two enterobacter aerogenes isolates expressing tem-24 b,  two escherichia coli isolates expressing tem-21 or tem-24 b, and one klebsiella pneumoniae isolate expressing shv-4/tem-15) responsible for urinary tract infections (utis) were found among 1,584 strains collected from community patients. the aim of the present study was to elucidate the route of emergence of these typically nosocomial organisms in the community. thus, the files of the five patients were analyzed over at least a decade, and potentially related esble from hospitals or clinics were examined. their enzymes were characterized at a molecular level, and the strains were typed by amplified-primed pcr, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, and restriction plasmid profile. all patients (c1 to c5) had risk factors for esble acquisition, including past history of hospitalization (2.5 to 23 months before). four (c1 and c3 to c5) had previously received antibiotics (concomitantly to 35 months earlier), two (c1 and c3) had indwelling urinary catheters and recurrent utis, and three (c2, c3, and c5) formerly experienced esble-induced utis (2 to 11 months before). the same esble and/or an identical or similar esbl-encoding plasmid was identified in the hospital ward (c1 to c4) or in a clinic (c5) where  the patients had previously resided. patients c1 and c4, infected with different  esble carrying a closely related plasmid, were hospitalized in the same unit. persistence of esble over at least a 5-year period was demonstrated for patient c3. thus, community-acquired utis in these patients likely resulted from nosocomially acquired esble or an esbl-encoding plasmid followed by a prolonged digestive carriage.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == occurrence and regulation of the ferric citrate transport system in escherichia coli b, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and photorhabdus luminescens.
AB  == in escherichia coli k-12, transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes fecabcde is initiated by binding of diferric dicitrate to the outer membrane protein feca which elicits a signaling cascade from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. the feci sigma factor is only active in the presence of fecr, which transfers the signal across the cytoplasmic membrane. in other bacteria, fecira homologues control iron transport gene transcription by siderophores other than citrate. however, in most cases, the feci homologues are active in the absence of the fecr homologues, which might function as anti-sigma factors. since not all e. coli strains contain a fec system, we determined the occurrence of fec genes in selected enterobacteriaceae and the dependence of feci activity on fecr. incomplete fecira systems were chromosomally encoded in enterobacter aerogenes strains and plasmid-encoded in k. pneumoniae. e. coli b, photorhabdus luminescens and one of three klebsiella pneumoniae strains had a functional fecira regulatory system as in e. coli k-12. the cytoplasmic n-terminal fecr fragments caused constitutive feci activity in the absence of ferric citrate. the pcr-generated mutant feci(d40g) was inactive and feci(s15p) was partially active. fecr of e. coli k-12 activated feci of all tested strains except feci encoded on the virulence plasmid plvpk of k. pneumoniae, which differed from e. coli k-12 feci by having mutations in region 4, which is important for interaction with fecr. the c-terminally truncated fecr homologue of plvpk was inactive. plvpk-encoded feca contains a 38-residue sequence in front of the signal sequence that did not  prevent processing and proper integration of feca into the outer membrane of e. coli and lacks the signaling sequence required for transcription initiation of the fec transport genes, making it induction-incompetent but transport-competent. the evidence indicates that fecirabcde genes are acquired by horizontal dna transfer and can undergo debilitating mutations.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == microbial partitioning to settleable particles in stormwater.
AB  == the degree to which microbes in the water column associate with settleable particles has important implications for microbial transport in receiving waters, as well as for microbial removal via sedimentation (i.e. detention basins). the partitioning behavior of several bacterial, protozoan and viral indicator organisms is explored in three urban streams under both storm and dry weather conditions. the fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles in stormwater is estimated through use of a centrifugation technique which is calibrated using suspensions of standard particles (e.g., glass, latex). the fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles varies by type of microbe, and the partitioning behavior of each organism generally changes between dry weather and storm conditions. bacterial indicator organisms (fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci) exhibited relatively consistent behavior, with an  average of 20-35% of organisms associated with these particles in background samples and 30-55% in storm samples. clostridium perfringens spores exhibited the highest average level of particle association, with storm values varying from 50% to 70%. results related to total coliphage partitioning were more variable, with  20-60% associated with particles during storms. these estimates should be valuable in surface water quality modeling efforts, many of which currently assume that all microbes exist as free (unattached) organisms.

TI  == increased expression of a bacterial phosphotriesterase in escherichia coli through directed evolution.
AB  == we devised a growth-based strategy for screening phosphotriesterase mutant libraries for variants with enhanced activity towards organophosphates that generate dimethyl phosphate when hydrolysed. phosphotriesterase mutants were screened for activity by growing transformed escherichia coli on agar plates containing methyl paraoxon as a sole phosphorus source. e. coli is capable of growth under these conditions when coexpressing the phosphotriesterase from agrobacterium radiobacter p230 (opda) and the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase from enterobacter aerogenes (gpdq). the latter enzyme can hydrolyse the dimethyl phosphate produced by the phosphotriesterase to methyl phosphate, which can then be used by e. coli as a source of phosphate. phosphotriesterase was expressed from the lac promoter at levels such that its activity was growth-rate limiting. cultures of the largest colonies (1% of the transformants) were assayed for activity towards paraoxon spectrophotometrically  in microtitre plates. this process produced e. coli variants with higher whole cell activity than wild-type, which was found to be a consequence of increased protein expression rather than any increase in enzymatic activity. the mutations  present in these mutant enzymes with increased expression were exclusively in the coding region, suggesting the improvement occurs post-transcriptionally.

TI  == (1)h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == beta-lactam screening by specific residues of the ompf eyelet.
AB  == beta-lactams use aqueous channels of porins to penetrate gram-negative bacteria.  the l3 loop of escherichia coli ompf porin is a key feature that actively contributes to both channel size and electrostatic properties. acid residues d113, e117, and d121 are responsible for the negative part of the local electrostatic field on this loop. two substitutions, d113a and d121a, located in  the negatively charged cluster of the ompf eyelet, increase the likelihood of producing bacteria susceptible to several beta-lactams. d113a substitution results in an increase in the ampicillin, cefoxitin, and ceftazidime susceptibility. molecular modeling suggests that the charges harbored by the beta-lactam molecules interact with the charged residues located inside the porin eyelet.

TI  == chloramphenicol and expression of multidrug efflux pump in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == chloramphenicol has been reported to act as an inducer of the multidrug resistance in escherichia coli. a resistant variant able to grow on plates containing 64 microg/ml chloramphenicol was obtained from the enterobacter aerogenes atcc 13048-type strain. chloramphenicol resistance was due to an active efflux of this antibiotic and it was associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline, but not to aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antibiotics. mdr in the chloramphenicol-resistant variant is linked to the overexpression of the major acrab-tolc efflux system. this overexpression seems unrelated to the global mar and the local acrr regulatory pathways.

TI  == antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  == we developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. the defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli). analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vlds) equivalent to  conventional 50% lethal doses (ld(50)s), ld(90)s, ld(99)s, and ld(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. on the basis of their respective vld(90)s and vld(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against s. aureus were hnp2 > hnp1 > hnp3 > hnp4. in contrast, their relative potencies against e. coli and e.  aerogenes were hnp4 > hnp2 > hnp1 = hnp3. hd5 was as effective as hnp2 against s. aureus and as effective as hnp4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel.  hd6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including b. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. the assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised  intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of hd6.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == rama is an alternate activator of the multidrug resistance cascade in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == multidrug resistance (mdr) in enterobacter aerogenes can be mediated by induction of mara, which is triggered by certain antibiotics and phenolic compounds. in this study, we identified the gene encoding rama, a 113-amino-acid regulatory protein belonging to the arac-xyls transcriptional activator family, in the enterobacter aerogenes atcc 13048 type strain and in a clinical multiresistant isolate. overexpression of rama induced an mdr phenotype in drug-susceptible escherichia coli jm109 and e. aerogenes atcc 13048, as demonstrated by 2- to 16-fold-increased resistance to beta-lactams, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and  quinolones, a decrease in porin production, and increased production of acra, a component of the acrab-tolc drug efflux pump. we show that rama enhances the transcription of the marrab operon but is also able to induce an mdr phenotype in a mar-deleted strain. we demonstrate here that rama is a transcriptional activator of the mar regulon and is also a self-governing activator of the mdr cascade.

TI  == growth of escherichia coli coexpressing phosphotriesterase and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, using paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source.
AB  == phosphotriesterases catalyze the hydrolytic detoxification of phosphotriester pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents with various efficiencies. the directed evolution of phosphotriesterases to enhance the breakdown of poor substrates is desirable for the purposes of bioremediation. a limiting factor in  the identification of phosphotriesterase mutants with increased activity is the ability to effectively screen large mutant libraries. to this end, we have investigated the possibility of coupling phosphotriesterase activity to cell growth by using methyl paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source. the catabolism of  paraoxon to phosphate would occur via the stepwise enzymatic hydrolysis of paraoxon to dimethyl phosphate, methyl phosphate, and then phosphate. the escherichia coli strain dh10b expressing the phosphotriesterase from agrobacterium radiobacter p230 (opda) is unable to grow when paraoxon is used as  the sole phosphorus source. enterobacter aerogenes is an organism capable of growing when dimethyl phosphate is the sole phosphorus source. the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing dimethyl phosphate has been previously characterized  as a nonspecific phosphohydrolase. we isolated and characterized the genes encoding the phosphohydrolase operon. the operon was identified from a shotgun clone that enabled e. coli to grow when dimethyl phosphate is the sole phosphorus source. e. coli coexpressing the phosphohydrolase and opda grew when paraoxon was the sole phosphorus source. by constructing a short degradative pathway, we have  enabled e. coli to use phosphotriesters as a sole source of phosphorus.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == protistan grazing analysis by flow cytometry using prey labeled by in vivo expression of fluorescent proteins.
AB  == selective grazing by protists can profoundly influence bacterial community structure, and yet direct, quantitative observation of grazing selectivity has been difficult to achieve. in this investigation, flow cytometry was used to study grazing by the marine heterotrophic flagellate paraphysomonas imperforata on live bacterial cells genetically modified to express the fluorescent protein markers green fluorescent protein (gfp) and red fluorescent protein (rfp). broad-host-range plasmids were constructed that express fluorescent proteins in three bacterial prey species, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas putida. micromonas pusilla, an alga with red autofluorescence, was also used as prey. predator-prey interactions were quantified by using a facscan  flow cytometer and analyzed by using a perl program described here. grazing preference of p. imperforata was influenced by prey type, size, and condition. in competitive feeding trials, p. imperforata consumed algal prey at significantly lower rates than fp (fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria of similar or different size. within-species size selection was also observed, but only for p.  putida, the largest prey species examined; smaller cells of p. putida were grazed preferentially. no significant difference in clearance rate was observed between  gfp- and rfp-labeled strains of the same prey species or between wild-type and gfp-labeled strains. in contrast, the common chemical staining method, 5-(4,6-dichloro-triazin-2-yl)-amino fluorescein hydrochloride, depressed clearance rates for bacterial prey compared to unlabeled or rfp-labeled cells.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == glom is a novel mitochondrial dna packaging protein in physarum polycephalum and  causes intense chromatin condensation without suppressing dna functions.
AB  == mitochondrial dna (mtdna) is packed into highly organized structures called mitochondrial nucleoids (mt-nucleoids). to understand the organization of mtdna and the overall regulation of its genetic activity within the mt-nucleoids, we identified and characterized a novel mtdna packaging protein, termed glom (a protein inducing agglomeration of mitochondrial chromosome), from highly condensed mt-nucleoids of the true slime mold, physarum polycephalum. this protein could bind to the entire mtdna and package mtdna into a highly condensed  state in vitro. immunostaining analysis showed that glom specifically localized throughout the mt-nucleoid. deduced amino acid sequence revealed that glom has a  lysine-rich region with proline-rich domain in the n-terminal half and two hmg boxes in c-terminal half. deletion analysis of glom revealed that the lysine-rich region was sufficient for the intense mtdna condensation in vitro. when the recombinant glom proteins containing the lysine-rich region were expressed in escherichia coli, the condensed nucleoid structures were observed in e. coli. such in vivo condensation did not interfere with transcription or replication of  e. coli chromosome and the proline-rich domain was essential to keep those genetic activities. the expression of glom also complemented the e. coli mutant lacking the bacterial histone-like protein hu and the hmg-boxes region of glom was important for the complementation. our results suggest that glom is a new mitochondrial histone-like protein having a property to cause intense dna condensation without suppressing dna functions.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a french university-affiliated hospital.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to investigate the epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esble) in our hospital. we determined the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in enterobacteriaceae over a 2-year period. we also characterised esbls by isoelectric focusing (ief) and investigated the epidemiological relatedness of eblse by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). during this period, 70 patients were colonised/infected with one or several strains of eblse, giving a crude incidence of 0.095 per 1000 patient-days. we found that esbl-producing enterobacter aerogenes were the main source of esble dissemination. indeed, 59.5% of esble were e. aerogenes and 21.9% of the other esble resulted from a plasmid transfer originating from e. aerogenes. ief and pfge analysis demonstrated that the dissemination of esbl from e. aerogenes in our hospital was due to a single clone that always harbours tem-24. this emphasises the importance of standard contact isolation precautions and the early detection of esble-colonised patients in high risk departments like intensive care units.

TI  == comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  == an agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of  antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. the catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. the catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (cs)  catheters, cs catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (cs+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (mr) catheters and silver catheters against staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis rif-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. no significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. in both models, cs+ and mr catheters were effective against s. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas cs catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. cs+ catheters were  effective against s. epidermidis rif-r2, whereas mr catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. cs+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans in the agar model, whereas mr catheters were effective only against s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains. silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. the agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

TI  == the beta-glucoside genes of klebsiella aerogenes: conservation and divergence in  relation to the cryptic bgl genes of escherichia coli.
AB  == the ability to metabolize aromatic beta-glucosides such as salicin and arbutin varies among members of the enterobacteriaceae. the ability of escherichia coli to degrade salicin and arbutin appears to be cryptic, subject to activation of the bgl genes, whereas many members of the klebsiella genus can metabolize these  sugars. we have examined the genetic basis for beta-glucoside utilization in klebsiella aerogenes. the klebsiella equivalents of bglg, bglb and bglr have been cloned using the genome sequence database of klebsiella pneumoniae. nucleotide sequencing shows that the k. aerogenes bgl genes show substantial similarities to the e. coli counterparts. the k. aerogenes bgl genes in multiple copies can also  complement e. coli mutants deficient in bglg encoding the antiterminator and bglb encoding the phospho-beta-glucosidase, suggesting that they are functional homologues. the regulatory region bglr of k. aerogenes shows a high degree of similarity of the sequences involved in bglg-mediated regulation. interestingly,  the regions corresponding to the negative elements present in the e. coli regulatory region show substantial divergence in k. aerogenes. the possible evolutionary implications of the results are discussed.

TI  == persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. it is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action  after the product has been applied. we describe here a silver-based disinfectant  technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. methods: a comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. log reduction  of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. in a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was  measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, or salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. results: in the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent  quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against s aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against pseudomonas. no residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. the silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. in addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. conclusions: the findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial  populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.

AB  == the pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins a (sp-a) and d (sp-d), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. in this study, we examined the effect of sp-a and sp-d on the growth and viability of gram-negative bacteria. the pulmonary clearance of escherichia coli k12 was reduced in sp-a-null mice and was increased in sp-d-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. purified sp-a and sp-d inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes. in general, rough e. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and  collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough lps vesicles. although both sp-a and sp-d agglutinated e. coli k12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. at least part of the antimicrobial activity of sp-a and sp-d was localized to their c-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. incubation of e. coli k12 with sp-a or sp-d increased bacterial permeability. deletion of the e. coli ompa gene from a collectin-resistant smooth e. coli strain enhanced sp-a and sp-d-mediated growth inhibition. these data indicate that sp-a and sp-d are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the  proliferation of gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.

TI  == modification of outer membrane protein profile and evidence suggesting an active  drug pump in enterobacter aerogenes clinical strains.
AB  == two clinical strains of enterobacter aerogenes that exhibited phenotypes of multiresistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and kanamycin were investigated. both strains showed a porin pattern different from that of a susceptible strain, with a drastic reduction in  the amount of the major porin but with an apparently conserved normal structure (size and immunogenicity), together with overproduction of two known outer membrane proteins, ompx and lamb. in addition, the full-length o-polysaccharide phenotype was replaced by a semirough ra phenotype. moreover, in one isolate the  intracellular accumulation of chloramphenicol was increased in the presence of the energy uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting an energy-dependent efflux of chloramphenicol in this strain. the resistance strategies used by these isolates appear to be similar to that induced by stress  in escherichia coli cells.

TI  == potential for detection of microorganisms and heavy metals in potable water using electronic nose technology.
AB  == studies have been carried out to determine the potential for the detection of different microbial species (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa), alone and in the presence of low concentrations of different heavy metals (as, cd, pb and zn) in bottled, reverse osmosis (ro) and tap water, using an electronic nose. studies show that it is possible to discriminate control water samples from water contaminated with 0.5 ppm of a mixture of metals. the presence of heavy metals may modify the activity of microorganisms and thus the volatile production patterns. bacterial species at 10(2)-10(4) colony forming units (cfus) ml(-1) could be detected after 24 h of incubation. work is in progress to identify the limits of detection for a range of other microorganisms, including, fungi and cyanobacteria, and chlorinated phenols using electronic nose technology.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. esbl producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. as information on esbl producers causing urinary tract infection (uti) is not available from our country, the occurrence of esbl producing strains causing uti was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of esbl and non-esbl producers. methods: urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by stoke's method and esbl production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). the clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. results: sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were esbl producers. approximately 38.5 per cent of klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of escherichia coli, 24 per cent of enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of proteus sp. and the only citrobacter strain produced esbl. recent surgery was found to be a significant (p < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of esbls. approximately 30 per cent of the esbl producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. there was no difference between the esbl producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. interpretation & conclusion: a high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced esbl. since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for esbl production routinely to avoid treatment failures.

AB  == the synthesis of six 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-4,5dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles 3a-f has been achieved in a facile manner by the reaction of an appropriate arylamidoxime  1a-f with butyraldehyde 2. oxidation of 3a-f individually using mno(2) in ch(2)cl(2) or sodium hypochlorite in thf/h(2)o furnished 1,2,4-oxadiazoles 4a-f in good to excellent yields. compounds 4a-f were also evaluated against inflammation. except 4e, all of them reduced inflammation, however, 4c presented  better antiinflammatory activity. a preliminary antimicrobial activity tests of 3a-f showed that these compounds possess activity against some microorganisms. in fact, 3c and 3f have been found to be more effective against staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis, and candida albicans.

TI  == overexpression and purification of the three components of the enterobacter aerogenes acra-acrb-tolc multidrug efflux pump.
AB  == the tripartite acra-acrb-tolc system is the major efflux pump of the nosocomial pathogen enterobacter aerogenes. acra is a trimeric periplasmic lipoprotein anchored in the inner membrane, acrb is an inner membrane transporter and tolc is a trimeric outer membrane channel. in order to reconstitute the acra-acrb-tolc system of e. aerogenes in artificial membranes, we overexpressed and purified the three proteins. the e. aerogenes acra, acrb and tolc open reading frames were individually inserted in the expression vector pet24a(+), in frame with a sequence coding a c-terminal hexahistidine tag to allow purification by inac (immobilized nickel affinity chromatography). the mature acra-6his was overproduced in a soluble form in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli bl21(de3). acra-6his was purified under native conditions in two steps using inac and gel permeation chromatography. we obtained about 25 mg of 97% pure acra-6his per liter of culture. acrb-6his was solubilized from the membrane fraction of e. coli c43(de3) in 300 mm nacl, 5% triton x-100 and purified in one step by inac. the acrb-6his enriched fraction was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. the final yield was 1-2 mg of 95% pure acrb-6his per liter of culture. the membrane fraction of e. coli bl21(de3)plyss containing tolc-6his was first treated with 2% triton x-100,  30 mm mgcl(2) to solubilize the inner membrane proteins. after ultracentrifugation, the pellet was treated with 5% triton x-100, 5 mm edta to solubilize the outer membrane proteins. approximately 5 mg of 95% pure tolc-6his  trimers per liter of culture was purified by inac.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge).
AB  == we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method  for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == molecular characterization of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance in a clinical isolate of escherichia coli.
AB  == the resistance phenotype of the clinical isolate of escherichia coli 1941 was characterized by high-level resistance to penicillins and to combinations amoxicillin-ticarcillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam. this resistance was carried by the conjugative plasmid pec1941 that encoded a beta-lactamase activity. the purified enzyme focused at pi 5.4 and was strongly inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid (ic50 = 0.09 microm). nucleotide sequence analysis revealed identity between the plasmid borne blatem gene of e. coli 1941 and the blatem-1b gene, except for a single c-to-t substitution at position 32 in the promoter region leading to the overlapping promoters pa and pb. no alterations in the expression of outer membrane porins ompc and ompf have been detected. these findings show that the resistance of e. coli 1941 to the combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors is related to high-level production of tem-1 enzyme expressed from the strong promoters pa and pb.

TI  == carbapenem resistance in a clinical isolate of enterobacter aerogenes is associated with decreased expression of ompf and ompc porin analogs.
AB  == we investigated the mechanism of imipenem resistance in enterobacter aerogenes strain 810, a clinical isolate from the united states for which the imipenem mic  was 16 micro g/ml and the meropenem mic was 8 micro g/ml. an imipenem-susceptible revertant, strain 810-rev, was obtained after multiple passages of the strain on  nonselective media. for the revertant, the imipenem mic was </=1 micro g/ml and the meropenem mic was </=0.25 micro g/ml. cefepime mics also decreased from 8 to  1 micro g/ml; however, the mics of ceftazidime (>/=128 micro g/ml), cefoxitin (>/=32 micro g/ml), and cefotaxime (>/=64 micro g/ml) remained the same. the beta-lactamase and porin profiles of the parent, the revertant, and carbapenem-susceptible type strain e. aerogenes atcc 13048 were determined. strains 810 and 810-rev each produced two beta-lactamases with pis of 8.2 and 5.4. the beta-lactamase activities of the parent and revertant were similar, even after induction with subinhibitory concentrations of imipenem. while 810-rev produced two major outer membrane proteins of 42 and 39 kda that corresponded to  escherichia coli porins ompc and ompf, respectively, the parent strain appeared to produce similar quantities of the 39-kda protein (ompf) but decreased amounts  of the 42-kda protein (ompc). when the parent strain was grown in the presence of imipenem, the 42-kda protein was not detectable by gel electrophoresis. however,  western blot analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the parent and revertant  with polyclonal antisera raised to the ompc and ompf analogs of klebsiella pneumoniae (anti-ompk36 and anti-ompk35, respectively) showed that strain 810 expressed only the 42-kda ompc analog in the absence of imipenem (the 39-kda protein was not recognized by the anti-ompf antisera) and neither the ompc nor the ompf analog in the presence of imipenem. the ompc analog is apparently down-regulated in the presence of imipenem; however, 810-rev expressed both ompc  and ompf analogs. these data suggest that imipenem resistance in e. aerogenes 810 is primarily associated with the lack of expression of the analogs of the ompc (42-kda) and ompf (39-kda) outer membrane proteins, which also results in decreased susceptibility to meropenem and cefepime.

TI  == prba, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  == the new gene prba encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in enterobacter cloacae strain em. this gene is located on the chromosome of strain em and was cloned by several pcr approaches. the prba gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass  of 54.6 kda. this enzyme presents analogies with other type b carboxylesterases,  mainly of eukaryotic origin. the cloning and expression of the prba gene in a strain of escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain em, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. the presence of homologues of prba was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including enterobacter gergoviae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas agglomerans, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and burkholderia cepacia. among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of e. gergoviae and 1 strain of burkholderia cepacia were able  to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). two strains of e. gergoviae, named g1 and g12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prba gene of e. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities.  the significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated e. cloacae and e. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prba gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.

TI  == method for estimation of low outer membrane permeability to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria plays a major role in beta-lactam resistance as it slows down antibiotic entry into the periplasm and therefore acts in synergy with beta-lactamases and efflux systems. up to now, the quantitative estimation of low outer membrane permeability by the method of zimmermann and rosselet was difficult because of the secreted and cell surface-associated beta-lactamases. the method presented here uses the acylation  of a highly sensitive periplasmic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) (blar-ctd) to  assess the rate of beta-lactam penetration into the periplasm. the method is dedicated to measurement of low permeability and is only valid when the diffusion rate through the outer membrane is rate limiting. cytoplasmic membrane associated pbps do not interfere since they are acylated after the very sensitive blar-ctd.  this method was used to measure the permeability of beta-lactamase-deficient strains of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cephacetrile. except for that of cephacetrile, the permeability coefficients were equal to or below 10(-7) cm/s. for cephacetrile, carbenicillin, and benzylpenicillin, the outer membrane of e. cloacae was 20 to 60 times less permeable than that of escherichia coli, whereas for cefotaxime, aztreonam, and ampicillin it was, respectively, 400, 1,000, and 700 times less permeable. the permeability coefficient for aztreonam is the lowest ever measured (p = 3.2 x 10(-9) cm/s). using these values, the mics for a beta-lactamase-overproducing strain of e. cloacae were successfully predicted, demonstrating the validity of the method.

TI  == helicobacter pylori may survive ampicillin treatment in the remnant stomach.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a gram-negative curved rod-like or spiral bacterium that chronically infects the human gastric mucosa, and is a major risk  factor for gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. after partial gastrectomy, some patients may have persistent h. pylori infection for five years or more. in this study, we detected three bacteria, i.e., klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli, in the gastric juice of patients with a remnant stomach. some of these bacteria produced beta-lactamase. these findings are potentially important since such bacteria could provide h. pylori with the chance to acquire drug resistance and to transfer drug resistance genes. this could be one reason why h. pylori is difficult to eradicate in the remnant stomach.

AB  == using outbreak-related strains of enterobacter aerogenes, we cloned and sequenced ompk39, the structural gene coding for outer membrane protein ompk39. its lack of expression was closely associated with a phenotype exhibiting low-level carbapenem resistance. detailed alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed that ompk39 is a member of the ompc subclass of enterobacterial porins,  with the highest degree of homology to klebsiella pneumoniae ompk36. based on a computerized alignment including escherichia coli phoe and ompf, the 3d structures of which are known from x-ray studies, ompk39 can be assumed to form the typical beta-barrel structure which is common to all enterobacterial porins.  since no inhibitory dna sequences could be detected in ompk39 in the resistant strains, porin deficiency leading to carbapenem resistance seems to involve alterations in key regulatory genes and/or the promotor sequence rather than a direct mutation in the structural gene.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == polyphosphate produced in recombinant escherichia coli confers mercury resistance.
AB  == an escherichia coli strain was generated by fusion of a mera-deleted broad-spectrum mer operon from pseudomonas k-62 with a bacterial polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk) from klebsiella aerogenes in vector puc119. a large amount of the ppk-specified polyphosphate was identified in the mercury-induced bacterium with the fusion plasmid designated pmkb18 but not in the cells without mercury induction. these results suggest that the synthesis of polyphosphate as well as the expression of the mer genes is mercury-inducible and regulated by merr. the e. coli strain with pmkb18 was more resistant to both hg2+ and c6h5hg+ than its isogenic strain with cloning vector puc119. the recombinant strain accumulated more mercury from hg2+- and c6h5hg+-contaminated medium. hg2+ transported into the cytoplasm appeared to be bound by chelation with the polyphosphate produced by the recombinant cells. the transported phenylmercury was degraded to hg2+ before the chelation since polyphosphate did not directly chelate with c6h5hg+. these results indicate that polyphosphate is capable of reducing the cytotoxicity of the transported hg2+ probably via chelation between polyphosphate and hg2+.

TI  == prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae: an italian survey.
AB  == the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. a total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated esbl producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated esbl producer, followed by k. pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). however, amongst all esbl producers, k. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by p. mirabilis (25.7%). all the strains positive to dd tests were confirmed for the carriage of tem and shv genes using colony-blot hybridisation (ch). a total of 447 strains (88.0%) were ch-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the tem-type probe, 30.1% with the shv-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. in conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all enterobacteriaceae tested produced esbls,  42.3% of which were tem-derived enzymes. more than 20% of p. stuartii, k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. the double-disk test seems to  be a useful test to identify esbl producing strains.

TI  == epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter isolates  in a spanish hospital during a 12-year period.
AB  == fifteen enterobacter clinical isolates (11 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 3 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 1 enterobacter gergoviae isolate), representing 0.4% of all enterobacter isolates recovered in our hospital from 1989 to 2000, were suspected of harboring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). these isolates were recovered from 14 different patients. esbls were transferred by conjugation into an escherichia coli recipient strain. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a single clone of e. aerogenes and six different clones of e. cloacae. four of these e. cloacae clonal types were represented by only one isolate each, but the other two were represented by  three and four isolates, respectively. isoelectric focusing, susceptibility phenotyping, pcr analysis, and sequencing demonstrated the presence of three different esbls. the most frequent was the recently characterized ctx-m-10 esbl,  which was found in the e. gergoviae isolate and in all but one of the e. cloacae  isolates. the remaining e. cloacae isolate harbored a tem-27 esbl, and the three  e. aerogenes isolates harbored a tem-24 esbl. pfge revealed that our e. aerogenes strain was indistinguishable from the french tem-24-producing e. aerogenes endemic clone. although a low prevalence of esbl-producing enterobacter isolates  was found in our institution over a 12-year period, a diversity of nonepidemic e. cloacae clones was detected, as was the persistence of the ctx-m-10 beta-lactamase. the presence of the tem-24-producing e. aerogenes french clone in our institution also demonstrates the intercountry dissemination of esbl-producing isolates.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus in italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and of  staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the italian epidemiological observatory survey sponsored by the smith-kline foundation. a standardised method was used to determine the mics of 22 antibiotics against isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), escherichia coli (n=684), enterobacter cloacae (n=342), enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the mics of 11 antibiotics against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). overall, the susceptibility rate of enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). during the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. in contrast, enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. of the total number of staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed  a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). rates of susceptibility of particular species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains  from different geographical areas of italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [icu] inpatients, non-icu inpatients). susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central italy. the susceptibility of escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. no significant differences in susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae or escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to icu and non-icu units. the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was higher in icu inpatients (52%) than in non-icu inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

TI  == relationship between teat-end callosity and occurrence of clinical mastitis.
AB  == a longitudinal study in 15 herds, with a total of 2157 cows, was conducted to examine the relationship between teat-end callosity (tec) and the incidence of clinical mastitis. during the 1.5-yr study period, clinical mastitis was diagnosed by the farmers based on clinical signs. teat-end callosity was scored every month according to a teat-end callosity classification system, which discriminates between teat-end callosity thickness (tect) and roughness (tecr). differences in tect between healthy and clinical mastitis quarters within infected cows were small but significant 3 mo before (0.13 higher), in the month  during which the clinical mastitis occurred (0.08 higher), and in the following 2 mo (0.06 and 0.05 higher). to compare tect and tecr between cows with and without clinical mastitis, 199 cows with clinical mastitis were paired with control cows  based on herd, days in milk, and parity. clinical mastitis cows had more tec than their healthy herd mates, particularly when clinical mastitis occurred between the second and fifth months of lactation. clinical escherichia coli mastitis in the second or third month of lactation occurred in cows with less tec than in cows with clinical mastitis caused by other pathogens. clinical culture-negative, yeast, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes mastitis cows had more tect and tecr than other cows with clinical mastitis in the same month of lactation. pointed teat ends had higher tect and tecr than flat or inverted teat  ends. teat-end callosity thickness increased with a higher milk yield at peak production.

AB  == an ethnobotanical investigation on the medicinal uses of some species of terminalia and combretum (combretaceae) was carried out in mbeya, tanzania during a 5-weeks field expedition. of the sixteen species collected, combretum fragrans  f. hoffm., combretum molle g. don., combretum psidioides welw., combretum zeyheri sond., terminalia kaiserana f. hoffm. and terminalia sericea burch ex. dc. have medical applications against various bacterial infections, such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and against symptoms like diarrhoea, hypertension and even cancer. antimicrobial screening of the crude extracts of the selected combretum and terminalia species was performed by the agar diffusion method. among the most effective extracts were methanol extracts of the roots of terminalia sambesiaca engl. & diels., t. kaiserana guill. & perrott., t. sericea burch. ex dc., c. fragrans f. hoffm. and combretum padoides engl. & diels., all of which showed marked inhibition against gram-positive bacteria, and were also good inhibitors of enterobacter aerogenes. all four of the extracts of the roots of t. sericea tested, (methanol, ethanol, acetone and hot water) had good antimicrobial activity. a methanolic leaf extract of t. kaiserana was the only extract to have  a bacteriocidic effect on escherichia coli. methanol root extracts of t. sambesiaca and methanol leaf extracts of t. sericea were the most effective against candida albicans. the results of the antimicrobial screening support the  ethnomedical uses of these plants.

TI  == evaluation of ppk-specified polyphosphate as a mercury remedial tool.
AB  == to evaluate the utility of polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk)-specified polyphosphate in mercury remediation, a fusion plasmid, pmk27, with ppk from klebsiella aerogenes and mercury transport genes, mert and merp, from pseudomonas k-62, was constructed. the transcription and translation of ppk, mert and merp were found to be mercury-inducible. the ppk-specified polyphosphate was identified in cells preinduced by hg2+, but not in cells without mercury induction, suggesting that the synthesis of polyphosphate is regulated by merr. the hypersensitive phenotype to hg2+, shown by bacteria with pmrd141, which contains mert and merp, was almost completely restored to its original levels when the ppk was introduced into the plasmid, suggesting that the hg2+-toxicity was reduced by the polyphosphate, probably via chelation formation. bacteria with pmk27 accumulated approximately 6-fold more mercury than the bacteria with cloning vector, puc119. these results clearly demonstrate that the polyphosphate  is capable of retaining mercury in the cells without taxing the cells. based on the results obtained in the present study, the fusion plasmid pmk27 may serve as  a strategy for mercury remediation.

AB  == survival of the coliform bacteria enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli was monitored in a neutral carboxymethylcellulose formulation and in shellac formulations with various ph and concentrations of ethanol and the preservative paraben; populations were subsequently measured from the surface of citrus fruit  coated with these formulations. numbers of the two bacteria increased over 24 h from 10(6) cfu/ml to approximately 10(8) cfu/ml in the carboxymethylcellulose solution, but over this time numbers remained little changed in the neutral solution of shellac. the enterobacter was more tolerant of alcohol over a 3-h period: although its numbers in a shellac solution with 10% ethanol dropped from  more than 10(6) cfu/ml to just over 10(3) cfu/ml. e. coli and a third species. klebsiella pneunoniae, declined toward the limit of detection (5 cfu/ ml) during  this time. the addition of morpholine to increase the formulation ph to 9.0 caused numbers of bacteria to plummet to an undetectable level within 30 to 60 min. on ruby red grapefruit and valencia oranges in storage at 13 degrees c numbers of e. aerogenes and e. coli declined over 2 weeks from 10(5) cfu/cm2 to less than 2.5 x 10(1), but most of the loss in numbers occurred within 1 day. numbers remained significantly less on shellacked fruit compared with those applied in the carboxymethylcellulose coating, and a shellac coating prepared from a ph 9 solution was more toxic to these species than one in which 12% ethanol had been added to the neutral formulation. the addition of the preservative paraben in the basic shellac was further inhibitory.

TI  == roles of glutamate synthase, gltbd, and gltf in nitrogen metabolism of escherichia coli and klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  == mutants of escherichia coli and klebsiella aerogenes that are deficient in glutamate synthase (glutamate-oxoglutarate amidotransferase [gogat]) activity have difficulty growing with nitrogen sources other than ammonia. two models have been proposed to account for this inability to grow. one model postulated an imbalance between glutamine synthesis and glutamine degradation that led to a repression of the ntr system and the subsequent failure to activate transcription of genes required for the use of alternative nitrogen sources. the other model postulated that mutations in gltb or gltd (which encode the subunits of gogat) were polar on a downstream gene, gltf, which is necessary for proper activation of gene expression by the ntr system. the data reported here show that the gltf model is incorrect for three reasons: first, a nonpolar gltb and a polar gltd mutation of k. aerogenes both show the same phenotype; second, k. aerogenes and several other enteric bacteria lack a gene homologous to gltf; and third, mutants of e. coli whose gltf gene has been deleted show no defect in nitrogen metabolism. the argument that accumulated glutamine represses the ntr system in gltb or gltd mutants is also incorrect, because these mutants can derepress the ntr system normally so long as sufficient glutamate is supplied. thus, we conclude that gltb or gltd mutants grow slowly on many poor nitrogen sources because they are starved for glutamate. much of the glutamate formed by catabolism of alternative nitrogen sources is converted to glutamine, which cannot be efficiently converted to glutamate in the absence of gogat activity. finally, gogat-deficient e. coli cells growing with glutamine as the sole nitrogen source increase their synthesis of the other glutamate-forming enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase, severalfold, but this is still insufficient to allow rapid growth under these conditions.

TI  == electrochemical biosensor array for the identification of microorganisms based on lectin-lipopolysaccharide recognition.
AB  == rapid identification of bacterial strains remains a well-known problem in applied medicine and, for viable pathogens, is an important diagnostic goal. we have investigated an electrochemical biosensor array, in which transduction is based on respiratory cycle activity measurements, where the microorganism's native respiratory chain is interrupted with non-native external oxidants. the selective biochemical recognition agents employed in this study are lectins that, once immobilized, recognize and bind to cell surface lipopolysaccharides. porous membranes with different surface properties were examined as potential immobilization supports for these lectins. optimizations performed using concanavalin a and e. coli jm105 show that immobilization methods involving pre-activated membranes significantly reduce the time required to create a functional lectin layer on the membrane surface. overall, we found general agreement between agglutination test results and the electrochemical assessment of lectin-cell binding. chronocoulometric measurements were made for cells captured on lectin-modified immunodyne abc membranes physically affixed to pt working electrodes. this lectin-based sensor array was exposed to viable cells of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as yeast, and chronocoulometric  measurements were used to generate a pattern of responses for each organism toward each lectin. principal component analysis was used to classify the chronocoulometric results for the different microbial strains. with this new method, six microbial species (baccilus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, saccharomyces cerevisiae) were readily distinguished.

AB  == the complete 108,845-nucleotide sequence of catabolic plasmid padp-1 from pseudomonas sp. strain adp was determined. plasmid padp-1 was previously shown to encode atza, atzb, and atzc, which catalyze the sequential hydrolytic removal of  s-triazine ring substituents from the herbicide atrazine to yield cyanuric acid.  computational analyses indicated that padp-1 encodes 104 putative open reading frames (orfs), which are predicted to function in catabolism, transposition, and  plasmid maintenance, transfer, and replication. regions encoding transfer and replication functions of padp-1 had 80 to 100% amino acid sequence identity to pr751, an incpbeta plasmid previously isolated from enterobacter aerogenes. padp-1 was shown to contain a functional mercury resistance operon with 99% identity to tn5053. complete copies of transposases with 99% amino acid sequence  identity to tnpa from is1071 and tnpa from pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were identified and flank each of the atza, atzb, and atzc genes, forming structures resembling nested catabolic transposons. functional analyses identified three new catabolic genes, atzd, atze, and atzf, which participate in atrazine catabolism.  crude extracts from escherichia coli expressing atzd hydrolyzed cyanuric acid to  biuret. atzd showed 58% amino acid sequence identity to trzd, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, from pseudomonas sp. strain nrrlb-12227. two other genes encoding the further catabolism of cyanuric acid, atze and atzf, reside in a contiguous cluster adjacent to a potential lysr-type transcriptional regulator. e. coli strains bearing atze and atzf were shown to encode a biuret hydrolase and allophanate hydrolase, respectively. atzdef are cotranscribed. atze and atzf are  members of a common amidase protein family. these data reveal the complete structure of a catabolic plasmid and show that the atrazine catabolic genes are dispersed on three disparate regions of the plasmid. these results begin to provide insight into how plasmids are structured, and thus evolve, to encode the  catabolism of compounds recently added to the biosphere.

AB  == resonance raman spectral intensities per average bacterial cell have been measured quantitatively for gram-negative escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes, as well as gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis. spectra have been obtained from cultures in the lag,  log, and stationary growth phases excited in turn by 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm light. although raman spectral peak positions (cm(-1)) excited by a given wavelength are very similar for all five bacterial species, the organisms are characterized by significantly different spectral intensity values. intensity changes are associated with growth phase changes in all of the species as well. a comparison of measured with estimated average intensities has been made for spectra of log-phase e. coli. it is possible to compare measured intensities with intensities estimated for log-phase e. coli on the basis of the knowledge of its  known average cellular molecular composition. a significant degree of hypochromism is observed in e. coli nucleic acid spectra. in contrast, strong average hyperchromism characterizes all aromatic amino acid peaks belonging to the same e. coli cells. results suggest that knowledge of spectral intensity values will enhance significantly the capability to identify bacteria by means of their uv resonance raman spectra.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  == utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  enterobacteriaceae. the results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the  members of these species. the genomic hybridization of selected enterobacteriaceae members with the escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to e. coli. however, the salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglr and bglg regions and the deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. similarly, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglr and bglg regions and deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. the homolog of the cel operon could be identified in s. sonnei and salmonella groups of organisms. possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.

TI  == h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  == in an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. in the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed mrsa, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans were resistant. the activity was induced only by h(2)o(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. the mean concentration of h(2)o(2) produced  by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microl of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. viridans group streptococci inhibited mrsa growth in saliva as well as in culture media. these results indicate that h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit mrsa colonization of oral cavities in newborns.

TI  == cloning and characterisation of male in burkholderia pseudomallei.
AB  == no recombinant protein is available for serodiagnosis or skin test in the diagnosis of melioidosis. this report describes the cloning of the male gene, which encodes an immunogenic protein of burkholderia pseudomallei. bi-directional dna sequencing of male revealed that the gene contained a single open reading frame encoding 416 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 44.4 kda. blast analysis showed that the putative protein encoded by male is homologous to the maltose-binding protein (mbp) of other bacteria. it has 48% and 63% amino acid identity and similarity with the mbp of brucella abortus, and male complementation assay showed that it partially complemented the function of the mbp of escherichia coli. several highly conserved regions among the mbp of b. pseudomallei, br. abortus, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, e. coli and  enterobacter aerogenes were observed. these regions represent signatures a, b, c, d and f identified in the mbp of e. coli. further sequence analysis revealed that the first 24 amino acid residues of the mbp of b. pseudomallei probably represent the n-terminal signal peptide of the protein. similar to the signal peptide of the mbp of e. coli, ent. aerogenes and s. typhimurium, the mbp of b. pseudomallei contains two basic residues in the first eight amino acids, followed by a hydrophobic core, with the last three amino acids in the signal peptide being ala-gln-ala, conforming to the consensus sequence ala-x-ala at positions -3 to -1 relative to the site of proteolytic cleavage for recognition by signal peptidase  i. further studies on serodiagnosis of melioidosis with recombinant mbp should be performed.

TI  == functional characterisation of urease accessory protein g (ureg) from potato.
AB  == the activation of the nickel metalloenzyme urease is a complex process. in bacteria, several urease accessory proteins are essential for incorporation of nickel into the active centre of urease. comparatively little is known about the  activation process and the proteins involved in plants. we cloned five different  cdnas encoding isoforms of urease accessory protein g (ureg) in potato. the 5'-coding region of these cdnas is highly polymorphic within solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, containing mainly a simple sequence repeat encoding histidine and aspartate. mapping on an ultrahigh-density map of the potato genome and southern  blot analysis showed that the isoforms arise from allelic differences of a single-copy gene which was located on chromosome 2. expression analysis at the mrna and protein levels indicated the presence of ureg in almost all tissues examined, consistent with the ubiquitous expression of urease. an attempt to correlate urease activity with ureg expression levels in different tissues was made. allelic copies of ureg were expressed in a tissue-specific manner. ureg from potato and the klebsiella aerogenes urease operon defective in bacterial ureg were co-expressed in escherichia coli. the plant gene complements the k. aerogenes ureg mutation, demonstrating that it encodes a urease accessory protein and indicating a structural conservation between the plant and the bacterial urease activation complexes.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of magnolia officinalis was investigated. the antimicrobial activity was assayed by  the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined for each compound using a twofold  serial dilution assay. the results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (mic = 25 microg/ml) against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (mic > or = 100 microg/ml) for shigella flexneii, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

AB  == background and objectives: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the all  india institute of medical sciences, new delhi during october-december, 1999 was  tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. methods: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included escherichia coli 87, klebsiella pneumoniae 54, pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant s. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive s. aureus 12), acinetobacter species 26, enterobacter aerogenes 9, proteus mirabilis 5, proteus  vulgaris 2, and citrobacter species 3. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using nccls guidelines. the cut-off values of  isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. results: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the  other aminoglycosides tested. interpretation and conclusions: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.

TI  == methionine-to-cysteine recycling in klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  == in the enteric bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, sulfate is reduced to sulfide and assimilated into the amino acid cysteine; in turn, cysteine provides the sulfur atom for other sulfur-bearing molecules in the cell, including methionine. these organisms cannot use methionine as a sole source of sulfur. here we report that this constraint is not shared by many other enteric bacteria, which can use either cysteine or methionine as the sole source of sulfur. the enteric bacterium klebsiella aerogenes appears to use at least two pathways to allow the reduced sulfur of methionine to be recycled into cysteine.  in addition, the ability to recycle methionine on solid media, where cys mutants  cannot use methionine as a sulfur source, appears to be different from that in liquid media, where they can. one pathway likely uses a cystathionine intermediate to convert homocysteine to cysteine and is induced under conditions  of sulfur starvation, which is likely sensed by low levels of the sulfate reduction intermediate adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. the cysb regulatory proteins  appear to control activation of this pathway. a second pathway may use a methanesulfonate intermediate to convert methionine-derived methanethiol to sulfite. while the transsulfurylation pathway may be directed to recovery of methionine, the methanethiol pathway likely represents a general salvage mechanism for recovery of alkane sulfide and alkane sulfonates. therefore, the relatively distinct biosyntheses of cysteine and methionine in e. coli and salmonella appear to be more intertwined in klebsiella.

TI  == alternative pathways for siroheme synthesis in klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  == siroheme, the cofactor for sulfite and nitrite reductases, is formed by methylation, oxidation, and iron insertion into the tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen iii (uro-iii). the cysg protein performs all three steps of siroheme biosynthesis in the enteric bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. in either taxon, cysg mutants cannot reduce sulfite to sulfide and require a source of sulfide or cysteine for growth. in addition, cysg-mediated methylation of uro-iii is required for de novo synthesis of cobalamin (coenzyme b(12)) in s. enterica. we have determined that cysg mutants of the related enteric bacterium klebsiella  aerogenes have no defect in the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. these data suggest that an alternative enzyme allows for siroheme biosynthesis in cysg-deficient strains of klebsiella. however, klebsiella cysg mutants fail to synthesize coenzyme b(12), suggesting that the alternative siroheme biosynthetic  pathway proceeds by a different route. gene cysf, encoding an alternative siroheme synthase homologous to cysg, has been identified by genetic analysis and lies within the cysfdnc operon; the cysf gene is absent from the e. coli and s. enterica genomes. while cysg is coregulated with the siroheme-dependent nitrite reductase, the cysf gene is regulated by sulfur starvation. models for alternative regulation of the cysf and cysg siroheme synthases in klebsiella and  for the loss of the cysf gene from the ancestor of e. coli and s. enterica are presented.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in a consecutive collection of clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. the abilities of various screening methods to detect esbls in enterobacters were simultaneously tested. among the 68 consecutive isolates (56 enterobacter cloacae and 12 enterobacter aerogenes isolates) that were analyzed for beta-lactamase content, 21 (25 and 58%, respectively) possessed transferable esbls with pis of 8.2 and phenotypic characteristics of shv-type enzymes, 8 (14.3%) of the e. cloacae isolates produced a previously nondescribed, clavulanate-susceptible esbl that exhibited a pi of 6.9 and that conferred a ceftazidime resistance phenotype on escherichia coli transconjugants, and 2 e. cloacae isolates produced both of these enzymes. among the total of 31 isolates that were considered esbl producers, the vitek esbl detection test was positive for 2 (6.5%) strains, and the conventional double-disk synergy test (ddst) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and with expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam was positive for 5 (16%) strains.  modifications of the ddst consisting of closer application of the disks (at 20 instead of 30 mm), the use of cefepime, and the use of both modifications increased the sensitivity of this test to 71, 61, and 90%, respectively. of the 37 isolates for which isoelectric focusing failed to determine esbls, the vitek test was false positive for 1 isolate and the various forms of ddsts were false-positive for 3 isolates.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

TI  == comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above mic at different creatinine clearances.
AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the dnak operon of lactobacillus sakei lth681.
AB  == the use of lactobacilli as starter organisms in food fermentation processes requires thorough knowledge of their reaction to the multitude of ecological factors including their response to stress. we have characterised the dnak gene region of lactobacillus sakei lth681. two chromosomal ecori fragments of 2.5 and  4.0 kb were identified using a homologous dnak probe generated by pcr. the sequence analysis of the cloned fragments showed that the dnak gene region consists of four heat shock genes with the organisation hrca-grpe-dnak-dnaj. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed high similarity to the corresponding heat shock proteins of gram-positive bacteria. an upstream located  orfy was found which exhibited substantial similarity (41.5%) to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase of enterobacter aerogenes. northern hybridisation analysis revealed that the transcription of the genes is induced by heat shock (42 degrees c) as well as salt (6%) or ethanol (10%) stress. several transcripts were detected including a polycistronic mrna of 4.9 kb which represents the transcript of the complete dnak gene region indicating a tetracistronic organisation of the dnak operon. the other rna fragments were identified as shorter transcripts (3.7 and 1.3 kb) or cleavage products of the polycistronic mrnas. the transcription start sites of the dnak operon were determined under inducing and non-inducing conditions. the site varied with the applied stress condition. a regulatory circe element was identified located between the transcription and translation start site. the promoter region including circe was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene gusa and expressed in l. sakei lth681. the kinetics of transcriptional induction of gusa by heat shocking were identical to those of the dnak operon confirming the involvement of the circe element in regulation of gene expression.

TI  == verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  == the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs. eight of  10 coliform strains (5 e. coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 klebsiella spp.)  inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.4, 13.3(o) brix) survived well at 4 degrees c for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 cfu/ml decrease). of 21 enterococci strains (enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans), only 2 e. durans and 3 e. faecium strains survived well. simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. in three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with e. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 cfu/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. e. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. the qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. based on its  exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that e. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple  cider sanitation and haccp programs.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == alanine dehydrogenase from enterobacter aerogenes: purification, characterization, and primary structure.
AB  == alanine dehydrogenase [ec 1. 4. 1. 1] was purified to homogeneity from a crude extract of enterobacter aerogenes icr 0220. the enzyme had a molecular mass of about 245 kda and consisted of six identical subunits. the enzyme showed maximal  activity at about ph 10.9 for the deamination of l-alanine and at about ph 8.7 for the amination of pyruvate. the enzyme required nad+ as a coenzyme. analogs of nad+, deamino-nad+ and nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide served as coenzymes. initial-velocity and product inhibition studies suggested that the deamination of l-alanine proceeded through a sequential ordered binary-ternary mechanism. nad+ bound first to the enzyme, followed by l-alanine, and the products were released  in the order of ammonia, pyruvate, and nadh. the km were 0.47 mm for l-alanine, 0.16 mm for nad+, 0.22 mm for pyruvate, 0.067 mm for nadh, and 66.7 mm for ammonia. the km for l-alanine was the smallest in the alanine dehydrogenases studied so far. the enzyme gene was cloned into escherichia coli jm109 cells and  the nucleotides were sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence was very similar  to that of the alanine dehydrogenase from bacillus subtilis. however, the enterobacter enzyme has no cysteine residue. in this respect, the enterobacter enzyme is different from other alanine dehydrogenases.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

AB  == the genes coding for the ecohk31i and eaei restriction-modification (r-m) systems from escherichia coli strain hk31 and enterobacter aerogenes, respectively, have  been cloned and sequenced. both enases recognize and cleave y/ggccr leaving 4 nucleotide 5'-protruding ends, while the mtases modify the internal cytosine. the systems were isolated on a 2.3kb asei fragment for ecohk31i, and a 4.6 kb hindiii fragment for eaei. the r and m genes of both systems converge and overlap by 14 nucleotides. previously, we found that m.ecohk31i consisted of two subunits, (alpha and beta), with the beta subunit being translated from an alternative open reading frame within the gene encoding the alpha subunit. sequence comparison between the ecohk31i and eaei systems reveals striking similarity. the eaeim gene also encodes alpha and beta polypeptides of 309 and 176 amino acids which share 96% and 97% identity, respectively, with those of ecohk31im. ecohk31ir and eaeir  encode proteins of 318 and 315 aa, respectively, which share 92% identity but are otherwise unique in the genbank database. the eaei and the ecohk31i r-m systems were found to be flanked by genes coding for integrases. it is possible that these integrases have facilitated the transfer of this system among different bacterial species.

TI  == coliforms and salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in fortaleza (ceara, brazil).
AB  == the bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of fortaleza (ceara, brasil), including the coastal zones of the ceara and coco rivers, were examined. the study was conducted during june, september and december 1993, and march 1994. the region was divided into two areas: (i) direct influence area (dia), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) indirect influence area (iia), located near to the coastal zone, including barra do ceara, kartodromo, volta de jurema, mucuripe, farol and caca e pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. the most probable number (mpn) of both total and fecal coliforms in dia was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. the following bacteria were identified: citrobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli. kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. results of total fecal mpn was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at caca e pesca beach. in december, at both dia and iia, salmonella was identified in several samples. in dia, the spatial distribution for salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. in iia, salmonella was identified at kartodromo and farol beaches throughout the sampling period.

AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == a mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  == a new method, called the mixed culture recovery (mcr) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of  largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable  cells. the mcr method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two  easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. in repeated experiments with strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. these results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.

AB  == dna sequences covering 57% of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase were determined for 16 strains of salmonella enterica, two strains of s. bongori, and  one strain each of citrobacter freundii and yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes sequences. the phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of s. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies ii which were unsupported by a common node. the two serotypes of s. bongori were separated from s. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies ii. a tight relationship was found between s. enterica subspecies iiia consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies iiib consisting of diphasic serotypes. this is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping  genes and the 23s rrna gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.

AB  == in connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of mining hospital in sosnowiec from january to september 1995. among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%),  urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). the examined diagnostic materials came from intensive care unit (87.0%), casualty and orthopaedic surgery clinic (5.0%) and general surgery clinic (3.0%). the most frequently isolated microorganisms were klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), serratia marcescens (36.8%), enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (serratia marcescens--74%, enterobacter cloacae--21%, enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, escherichia coli--5%). susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of karbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and cefamycyn). in case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.

TI  == plasmid-mediated resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins among enterobacter aerogenes strains.
AB  == resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins commonly develops in enterobacter  aerogenes during therapy due to selection of mutants producing high levels of the chromosomal bush group 1 beta-lactamase. recently, resistant strains producing plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have been isolated as  well. a study was designed to investigate esbl production among 31 clinical isolates of e. aerogenes from richmond, va., with decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a positive double-disk potentiation test. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. beta-lactamases were investigated by an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points (pis) and substrate or inhibitor profiles. decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam (mic range, 1 to 64 microg/ml) was detected and associated with resistance to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. all strains produced an inducible bush group 1 beta-lactamase (pi 83). twenty-nine of the 31 isolates also produced an enzyme similar to shv-4 (pi 7.8), while 1 isolate each produced an enzyme similar to shv-3 (pi 6.9) and to shv-5 (pi 8.2).  the three different shv-derived esbls were transferred by transconjugation to escherichia coli c600n and amplified by pcr. plasmid profiles of the clinical isolates showed a variety of different large plasmids. because of the linkage of  resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with esbl production, it is possible that the usage of these drugs was responsible for selecting plasmid-mediated resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in e. aerogenes. furthermore, it is important that strains such as these be recognized, because they can be responsible for institutional spread of resistance genes.

TI  == characteristics of the melibiose transporter and its primary structure in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == cells of enterobacter aerogenes can grow on melibiose as a sole source of carbon. this suggests the presence of melibiose operon in this organism. we found that e. aerogenes cells possess both alpha-galactosidase activity and melibiose transport activity, which were induced by melibiose. neither na+ nor li+ stimulated the melibiose transport. however, transport of methyl-beta-thiogalactoside (tmg) was  stimulated by li+ but not by na+. these findings suggest that the major coupling  cation for the melibiose transporter in e. aerogenes is h+. in fact, we observed  h+ entry into cells caused by an influx of melibiose and some of its analogs. we  cloned the melb gene which encodes the melibiose transporter, and sequenced it. deduced amino acid sequence of the transporter revealed that the melibiose transporter consists of 471 amino acid residues and the molecular weight was calculated to be 52214 da. the sequence showed high homology with the sequences of the melibiose transporters of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae. higher homology was found with the melibiose transporter of k. pneumoniae than with that of e. coli and s. typhimurium.

TI  == the nucleoside-specific tsx channel from the outer membrane of salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes: functional characterization and dna sequence analysis of the tsx genes.
AB  == the escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an integral outer-membrane protein (tsx) that functions as a substrate-specific channel for deoxynucleosides and the antibiotic albicidin, and also serves as a receptor for bacteriophages and colicins. we cloned the structural genes of the tsx proteins from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes and expressed them  in an e.coli tsx mutant. the heterologous tsx proteins fully substituted the e.coli tsx protein with respect to its function in deoxynucleoside and albicidin  uptake, and as receptor for colicin k. the tsx proteins from k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes were also proficient as receptors for several tsx-specific bacteriophages, whereas the corresponding protein from s. typhimurium did not confer sensitivity against these phages. the nucleotide sequence of the tsx genes from s. typhimurium, k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes was established. each of the tsx proteins is initially synthesized with typical bacterial signal sequence  peptides and the predicted mature forms of the tsx proteins have a calculated m(r) of 30,567 (265 residues), 31,412 (272 residues) and 31,477 (272 residues), respectively. multiple sequence alignments between the tsx proteins showed a high degree of sequence identity and revealed the presence of four hypervariable regions, which are thought to constitute segments of the polypeptide chain exposed at the cell surface. most notable was a deletion of 8 amino acids in one  of these hypervariable domains in the s. typhimurium tsx protein. when this deletion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding region of the e.coli tsx gene, the mutant tsx-515 protein lost its phage receptor function but still served as a colicin k receptor and as a substrate-specific channel, indicating that the region between residues 198 and 207 might be part of the bacteriophage receptor area. multiple sequence alignments, structural predictions and the properties of previously characterized tsx missense mutants were taken into account to develop a two-dimensional model for the topological organization of the tsx protein within the outer membrane.

AB  == the serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. blood samples were  drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the  following organisms: streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and  serratia marcescens. the median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for s. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). this difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. the ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == inactivation of glutaraldehyde by reaction with sodium bisulfite.
AB  == the microbiocidal activity of glutaraldehyde was inactivated by reaction with sodium bisulfite via formation of a proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of 2% (0.2m) alkaline glutaraldehyde indicated complete loss of glutaraldehyde at a 2.2:1 molar ratio of sodium bisulfite to glutaraldehyde. neither 1.7% (0.17 m) sodium bisulfite alone nor the glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex was microbiocidal when tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and polybac polyseed bod seed inoculum. bacterial inhibition tests indicated that the glutaraldehyde-sodium bisulfite complex had no effect on the growth of sewage microorganisms at concentrations as high as 50-100 ppm (5 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-3) m), with an ic50 of 230-440 ppm (2.3 x 10(-3)-4.4 x 10(-3) m), based on glutaraldehyde concentration. a 28-close bottle test showed a 5-d biodegradation  of 48% and 51%, and a 15-d biodegradation of 57% and 63% for 3:1 and 2.2:1 bisulfite to glutaraldehyde molar ratios, respectively. acute aquatic toxicity testing with daphnia magna demonstrated an lc50 of 41-109 ppm (4.1 x 10(-4)-10.9  x 10(-4) m) and a no-observed-effect concentration (noec) of 16 ppm (1.6 x 10(-4) m) for the proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex (based on glutaraldehyde concentration), approximately 10-fold higher than found for glutaraldehyde alone, indicating that the proposed glutaraldehyde-bisulfite complex is less toxic to the environment than glutaraldehyde.

TI  == incidence and susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative bacilli from 20 canadian intensive care units: 1989-1993.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in canadian intensive care units. design: the antimicrobial profiles of 1939 gram-negative bacilli isolated in 20 canadian intensive care units were analyzed using a custom designed microscan panel. setting: the majority of the hospitals were tertiary care institutions, but some community hospitals were included. patients: adult intensive care unit patients were the sources of isolates. main results: pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated microorganism overall, with escherichia coli the most common initial isolate. comparison of initial and  repeat isolates showed that p aeruginosa readily acquired resistance to all antibiotic classes except the aminoglycosides. enterobacter aerogenes developed resistance to ciprofloxacin and enterobacter cloacae demonstrated resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics except for imipenem on repeat isolation. other enterobacteriaceae remained susceptible. historical comparison with data derived  four years previously from 15 of the centres showed increased resistance of p aeruginosa and acinetobacter species to ciprofloxacin while other susceptibility  patterns remained stable. conclusions: the prevalence of gram-negative resistance in canadian hospitals is less than that reported in surveys done in some other countries, and was relatively stable over four years.

TI  == outbreak of tem-24-producing enterobacter aerogenes in an intensive care unit and dissemination of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase to other members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == we report an outbreak of enterobacter aerogenes in an intensive care unit (icu) and two medicine departments that produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase tem-24, which was difficult to detect by disk agar diffusion. the strains were compared by dna restriction fragment length polymorphism after pulsed-field gel electrophoresis following cleavage with xbai. this typing method indicated that a single strain, first isolated in the icu, spread throughout the other medical departments as a result of patient transfer. we also observed the transfer in vivo of the plasmid encoding tem-24 from the strain of enterobacter aerogenes to  different strains of escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii in the icu. it therefore appears that the epidemic involved results from two events: dissemination of one strain of enterobacter aerogenes and dissemination of the plasmid encoding tem-24 among various members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evidence suggesting cis action by the tnac leader peptide in regulating transcription attenuation in the tryptophanase operon of escherichia coli.
AB  == expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon in escherichia coli is regulated by  catabolite repression and transcription attenuation. elevated levels of tryptophan induce transcription antitermination at one or more rho factor-dependent termination sites in the leader region of the operon. induction  requires translation of a 24-residue coding region, tnac, located in the 319-nucleotide transcribed leader region preceding tnaa, the structural gene for  tryptophanase. in the present paper, we show that two bacterial species that lack tryptophanase activity, enterobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhimurium, allow  tryptophanase induction and tna operon regulation when they carry a plasmid containing the e. coli tna operon. the role of tnac in induction was examined by  introducing mutations in a 24-nucleotide segment of tnac of e. coli surrounding and including the crucial trp codon 12. some mutations resulted in a noninducible phenotype; these mostly introduced nonconservative amino acid substitutions in tnac. other mutations had little or no effect; these generally were in third positions of codons or introduced conservative amino acid replacements. a tryptophan-inserting, uga-reading glutamine suppressor trna was observed to restore partial regulation when trp codon 12 of tnac was changed to uga. stop codons introduced downstream of trp codon 12 in all three reading frames established that induction requires translation in the natural tnac reading frame. our findings suggest that the tnac leader peptide acts in cis to prevent rho-dependent termination.

TI  == a system to generate chromosomal mutations in lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  == a system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. it is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pwv01-derived ori+ repa- vector pori19, containing lacz alpha and the multiple cloning site of puc19. chromosomal alui fragments of lactococcus lactis were cloned in pori19 in repa+ helper strain escherichia coli ec101. the frequency of campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into l. lactis (repa-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pwv01 derivative pve6007. transformation of l. lactis mg1363 (pve6007) with the pori19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of repa-ts from pve6007. a temperature shift to 37 degrees c resulted in loss of pve6007 and integration of the pori19 derivatives at high frequencies. a bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acma) and one in the hitherto  uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. reintroduction of pve6007 into the  mal- mutant at 30 degrees c resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. the integration plasmid (pmal) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored mal+ colony to transform e. coli ec101. nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pmal revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with atp-binding proteins malk of  e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes and msmk of streptococcus mutans. this combined use of two types of conditional replicating pwv01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpirome against selected clinical enterobacterial isolates with beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
AB  == previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in greek hospitals. this resistance  is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the  acquisition of plasmids coding for shv-5 type beta-lactamase. in the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-c enzymes. the antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing shv-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. also cefpirome exhibited good activity against e. aerogenes strains with  reduced susceptibility to imipenem. these in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in greek hospitals.

TI  == molecular cloning, mapping, and regulation of pho regulon genes for phosphonate breakdown by the phosphonatase pathway of salmonella typhimurium lt2.
AB  == two pathways exist for cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus (c-p) bond of phosphonates, the c-p lyase and the phosphonatase pathways. it was previously demonstrated that escherichia coli carries genes (named phn) only for the c-p lyase pathway and that enterobacter aerogenes carries genes for both pathways (k.-s. lee, w. w. metcalf, and b. l. wanner, j. bacteriol. 174:2501-2510, 1992).  in contrast, here it is shown that salmonella typhimurium lt2 carries genes only  for the phosphonatase pathway. genes for the s. typhimurium phosphonatase pathway were cloned by complementation of e. coli delta phn mutants. genes for these pathways were proven not to be homologous and to lie in different chromosomal regions. the s. typhimurium phn locus lies near 10 min; the e. coli phn locus lies near 93 min. the s. typhimurium phn gene cluster is about 7.2 kb in length and, on the basis of gene fusion analysis, appears to consist of two (or more) genes or operons that are divergently transcribed. like that of the e. coli phn locus, the expression of the s. typhimurium phn locus is activated under conditions of pi limitation and is subject to pho regulon control. this was shown both by complementation of the appropriate e. coli mutants and by the construction of s. typhimurium mutants with lesions in the phob and pst loci, which are required for activation and inhibition of pho regulon gene expression,  respectively. complementation studies indicate that the s. typhimurium phn locus  probably includes genes both for phosphonate transport and for catalysis of c-p bond cleavage.

TI  == decreased transmission of enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an intensive care unit by nursing reorganization.
AB  == in our gastrointestinal surgical intensive care unit (sicu), the large number of  patients with multiple enterostomies enhances the risk of nosocomial transmission of gut extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esble) by health care workers. a control study performed in our sicu from june-august 1992  showed an esble gut colonization rate of 70%. to reduce this rate, nursing procedures were intensified or modified, particularly handwashing, single-use equipment and waste control. to test the efficiency of these procedures, 64 patients hospitalized for more than two days from september 1992-march 1993 were  screened for gut acquisition of esble. rectal samples were taken within 48 h after admission and then weekly. after nursing reorganization, the esble colonization rate dropped significantly to 40% (p < 0.001). twenty patients (31.7%) acquired a gut esble, after a mean of 24.3 +/- 13.7 days. each patient was colonized with one, two or three esble (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes). baseline characteristics of the 20 colonized and 39 non-colonized patients showed no significant difference (student's t-test, p > 0.05). the nursing workload, estimated as a omega index, was greater in the colonized group (p < 0.001). these findings show that strict observance of nursing procedures can significantly reduce esble acquisition in a high-risk surgical unit.

TI  == identification of a global repressor gene, rsma, of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora that controls extracellular enzymes, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, and pathogenicity in soft-rotting erwinia spp.
AB  == the production of extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase (pel), polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt) is activated by the  cell density (quorum)-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (hsl); plant signals; and aep genes during postexponential growth of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 71. studies with mutants of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71 derepressed in exoenzyme production led to the identification of a  negative regulator gene, rsma (rsm, repressor of secondary metabolites). nucleotide sequencing, transcript assays, and protein analysis established that a 183-bp open reading frame encodes the 6.8-kda rsma. rsma has extensive homology with the csra gene of escherichia coli, which specifies a negative regulator of carbon storage. moreover, the suppression of glycogen synthesis in e. coli by rsma indicates that the erwinia gene is functionally similar to csra. southern hybridizations revealed the presence of rsma homologs in soft-rotting and non-soft-rotting erwinia spp. and in other enterobacteria such as enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, serratia marcescens, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. rsma suppresses production of pel, peh, cel, and prt, plant pathogenicity, and synthesis of hsl in e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, and e. chrysanthemi. in the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71, rsma  reduces the levels of transcripts of hsli, a luxi homolog required for hsl biosynthesis. this specific effect and the previous finding that hsl is required  for extracellular enzyme production and pathogenicity in soft-rotting erwinia spp. support the hypothesis that rsma controls these traits by modulating the levels of the cell density (quorum)-sensing signal.

AB  == ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens. more than 90% of recent enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. in only five enteric species (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. enteritis-producing bacteria such as  salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli and yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (mic50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). fastidious gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten mics, including beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas species and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. the microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == the occurrence of duplicate lysyl-trna synthetase gene homologs in escherichia coli and other procaryotes.
AB  == the lysyl-trna synthetase (lysrs) system of escherichia coli k-12 consists of two genes, lyss, which is constitutive, and lysu, which is inducible. it is of importance to know how extensively the two-gene lysrs system is distributed in procaryotes, in particular, among members of the family enterobacteriaceae. to this end, the enterics e. coli k-12 and b; e. coli reference collection (ecor) isolates ec2, ec49, ec65, and ec68; shigella flexneri; salmonella typhimurium; klebsiella pneumoniae; enterobacter aerogenes; serratia marcescens; and proteus vulgaris and the nonenterics pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus megaterium were  grown in ac broth to a ph of 5.5 or less or cultured in sabo medium at ph 5.0. these growth conditions are known to induce lysrs activity (lysu synthesis) in e. coli k-12. significant induction of lysrs activity (twofold or better) was observed in the e. coli strains, the ecor isolates, s. flexneri, k. pneumoniae, and e. aerogenes. to demonstrate an association between lysrs induction and two distinct lysrs genes, southern blotting was performed with a probe representing an 871-bp fragment amplified from an internal portion of the coding region of the lysu gene. in initial experiments, chromosomal dna from e. coli k-12 strain mc4100 (lyss+ lysu+) was double digested with either bamhi and hindiii or bamhi and sali, producing hybridizable fragments of 12.4 and 4.2 kb and 6.6 and 5.2 kb, respectively. subjecting the chromosomal dna of e. coli k-12 strain gnb10181 (lyss+ delta lysu) to the same regimen established that the larger fragment from  each digestion contained the lysu gene. the results of southern blot analysis of  the other bacterial strains revealed that two hybridizable fragments were obtained from all of the e. coli and ecor collection strains examined and s. flexneri, k. pneumoniae, and e. aerogenes. only one lysu homolog was found with s. typhimurium and s. marcescens, and none was obtained with p. vulgaris. a single hybridizable band was found with both p. aeruginose and b, megaterium. these results show that the dual-gene lysrs system is not confined to e. coli k-12 and indicate that it may have first appeared in the genus enterobacter.

AB  == the effect of a change in the first line antibiotic treatment in a neonatal unit  was studied. a total of 238 neonates (g1), admitted between 1 january and 31 july 1989, and treated with gentamicin, were compared with 398 (g2) admitted between 1 august 1989 and 31 july 1990 who received amikacin, in the combination of ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside. this change was implemented in an attempt to prevent the spread of an epidemic strain of enterobacter cloacae resistant to third generation cephalosporins and all aminoglycosides, except amikacin. the change in treatment had no effect on the incidence of nosocomial infections [19.7% (g1) vs. 16.3% (g2) rr = 1.21 (0.86-1.70)], but the proportion of patients with nosocomial infections caused by the e. cloacae decreased (6.3% vs. 2.0% rr 3.14 ci 1.35-7.28). certain trends in the bacterial ecology emerged: e. aerogenes and enterococci increased in g2. the proportion of gentamicin-resistant strains such as e. cloacae or staphylococci decreased and there was no increase in aminoglycoside-resistant strains, except in escherichia coli, in which resistance to amikacin rose from 0 to 3%. this study illustrates the influence of antimicrobial therapy on the species and the resistance of strains isolated in nosocomial infections. it also highlights the need for epidemiologic surveillance, and poses the question of how best to modify antibiotic policy.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == chiral inversion of drug: role of intestinal bacteria in the stereoselective sulphoxide reduction of flosequinan.
AB  == chiral inversion at a sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers [(+/-)-7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphinyl-4-quinolone] occurred in conventional  rats but not in either germ-free rats or rats treated with antibiotics after an oral administration of each enantiomer. thus, it was postulated that the chiral inversion occurred by mechanisms mediated by intestinal bacteria. the intestinal  content isolated from conventional rats reduced r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan to produce the sulphide, while intestinal content from rats treated with antibiotics did not reduce the drug. several strains of facultative anaerobes possessed a high flosequinan reducing activity. escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae reduced r(+)-flosequinan to the sulphide stereoselectively. on the other hand, enterobacter aerogenes and micrococcus agilis exclusively reduced s(-)-flosequinan. the sulphide, which could be produced by intestinal bacteria from r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan, was readily absorbed upon an oral administration to rats, and was oxidized fairly rapidly to r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan and further to the sulphone form. based on these data, it has been confirmed that chiral inversion at the sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers occur via stereoselective reduction of sulphoxide by intestinal bacteria to form the sulphide, followed by oxidation of the sulphide in the body  to produce r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan.

TI  == the tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tryptophan biosynthesis in escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpr gene, the tryptophan (trp) repressor. trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, l-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator dna tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. the conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpr genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in e. coli. to clone trpr homologues, a deletion of the e. coli trpr gene, delta trpr504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the e. coli genome. plasmid clones of the trpr genes of enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation  of the delta trpr504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase  synthesis from a prophage-borne trpe-lacz gene fusion. the predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric trpr proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the dna-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. these differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator dna, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the trpr amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == [comparative study of single strand conformation polymorphism of 4.5s rna gene in enterobacteria].
AB  == a recently developed technique, non-isotopic single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (pcr-sscp), was applied to study the conserved feature of 4.5s rna gene in enterobacteria. the 4.5s rna gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using the template dna extracted respectively from five strains of escherichia coli and three strains of different genera in enterobacteriaceae, i.e. proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes. the pcr products were then carried out sscp analysis. the experimental results showed that there seemed to be no detectable differences in the size and  single strand conformation of 4.5s rna genes from above strains, except the negative strand conformation of enterobacter aerogenes. thus it can be seen that  the secondary structures of 4.5s rna gene in enterobacteria are quite conservative.

AB  == the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each  drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == molecular characterization of the enterobacter aerogenes tonb gene: identification of a novel type of tonb box suppressor mutant.
AB  == the tonb gene of enterobacter aerogenes was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. it complemented an e. coli tonb mutant as efficiently as e. coli tonb, except for colicin b and d sensitivities. however, colicin b and d sensitivities were complemented by a derivative in which the aspartate at position 165 was replaced by a glutamine (tonbd-165-->q) by site-directed mutagenesis. in e. coli, the corresponding amino acid is a glutamine (q-160) which is known to be altered in most mutants showing suppression of the btub451 mutation. fourteen independent btub451 suppressor mutations in e. aerogenes tonb  which all had suffered the same point mutation resulting in a change from glycine to valine at position 239 (g-239-->v) of the c-terminal end of the protein were isolated. the mutation was located within a region which is nonessential for function of e. aerogenes tonb as well as e. coli tonb. a constructed double mutation, expressing a d-165-->q/g-239-->v derivative, no longer acted as a btub451 suppressor. however, it restored colicin b and d sensitivities even more  efficiently than the d-165-->q derivative. corresponding mutations constructed in e. coli tonb, giving rise to q-160-->d, g-234-->v, and q-160-->d/g-234-->v derivatives, showed phenotypes comparable to the e. aerogenes mutations. we take  this as evidence that at least a functional interaction between the d-165 (q-160  in e. coli) and the g-239 (g-234 in e. coli) region is necessary for tonb function. the implications of this interaction for functional instability of tonb are discussed.

TI  == t lymphocyte responses to antigens of gram-negative bacteria in pyelonephritis.
AB  == we showed previously that large numbers of t lymphocytes accumulate within a few  days in the kidneys of rats with ascending pyelonephritis induced with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cd4+ t cells propagated from the lesions exhibited mhc-restricted proliferative responses to formalin-fixed bacteria of the species used to induce infection. in the present study we investigated further the nature of the antigens responsible for the t cell proliferation and studied the ability of different bacterial strains and species  to produce proliferative responses. we found that heat-killed bacteria were more  stimulatory than formalin-fixed bacteria, and that soluble supernatants of heat-killed organism were also effective. the stimulatory effects of supernatants were destroyed by trypsin and the responses were mhc-restricted. twelve different e. coli strains, with or without characteristics of uropathogenicity in humans, were all highly stimulatory to t cells derived from a kidney infected with a single e. coli strain. strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes,  and serratia marcescens--species of enterobacteriaceae closely related to e. coli--were also stimulatory, whereas more distantly related bacteria--proteus, morganella, and p. aeruginosa--were not. t cells propagated from kidneys infected with p. aeruginosa responded to supernatants of this organism, but not to e. coli supernatants. we conclude that a protein antigen (or antigens) shared by strains  of e. coli and related enterobacteriaceae, but not by other gram-negative bacteria, produce mhc-restricted proliferative responses of cd4+ t cells that infiltrate rat kidneys infected with e. coli.

AB  == the tonb gene of klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned on a 1.4-kb ecorv fragment and  expressed in escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment identified tonb as an open reading frame (orf) of 729 nt. the tonb protein consists of 243 amino acids (aa) and is highly homologous to enterobacter aerogenes tonb. the genetic context of k. pneumoniae and en. aerogenes tonb is the same, but is different from that of e. coli, salmonella typhimurium and serratia marcescens. k. pneumoniae tonb complemented an e. coli tonb mutant as efficiently as e. coli tonb when cloned on the same type of plasmid. replacement of the highly hydrophobic c terminus of e. coli tonb by the  weakly hydrophobic c terminus of k. pneumoniae tonb yielded a hybrid protein of the same activity as e. coli wild-type tonb. the result shows that the strong hydrophobicity of the c-terminal end is not necessary for the function of e. coli tonb.

AB  == a variety of sulphonates were tested for their ability to serve as nutrients for  escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens. cysteate, taurine and isethionate could not serve as sole sources of carbon and energy but, under aerobic conditions, could be utilized as sources of sulphur. both sulphate  and sulphonate supported equivalent cell yields, but the generation times varied  with the sulphonate being metabolized. the sulphonate-s of hepes buffer, dodecane sulphonate and methane sulphonate was also utilized by some strains, whereas the  sulphonate-s of taurocholate was not. none of the sulphonates tested served as a  sulphur source for growth under anaerobic conditions. sulphonate utilization appears to be a constitutive trait; surprisingly, however, cells of e. coli and ent. aerogenes utilized sulphate-s in preference to that of sulphonate, when both were present. e. coli mutants unable to use sulphate as a source of sulphur because of deficiencies in sulphate permease, atp sulphurylase, adenylylsulphate  kinase (aps kinase) or glutaredoxin and thioredoxin were able to utilize sulphonates; hence sulphate is not an obligatory intermediate in sulphonate utilization. however, mutants deficient in sulphite reductase were unable to utilize sulphonates; therefore, this enzyme must be involved in sulphonate utilization, though it is not yet known whether it acts upon the sulphonates themselves or upon the inorganic sulphite derived from them.

AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

AB  == the in vitro activity of q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin.  the mics of q-35 for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than  those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. for 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (mic90 = 100 micrograms/ml), q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (mic90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). the mic90s of q-35 against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and q-35 was 2-  to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrase of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. nagase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of actinomyces pyogenes (p less than 0.01) and staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. similarly nagase treatment significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees c. nagase did not reduce the numbers of escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. since nagase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.

TI  == isolation and characterization of kika, a region on incn group plasmids that determines killing of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == transfer of the incn group plasmid pcu1 from escherichia coli to klebsiella oxytoca by conjugation kills a large proportion (90 to 95%) of the recipients of  plasmid dna, whereas transfer to e. coli or even to the closely related enterobacter aerogenes does not. two regions, kika and kikb, have been identified on pcu1 that contribute to the kik (killing in klebsiellas) phenotype. we have localized the kika region to 500 bp by deletion analysis and show by dna-dna hybridization that kika is highly conserved among the plasmids of incompatibility group n. the expression in k. oxytoca of kika under the control of the strong inducible e. coli tac promoter results in loss of cell viability. the nucleotide  sequence showed two overlapping open reading frames (orfs) within the kika region. the first orf codes for a putative polypeptide of 104 amino acids (orf104). the second orf codes for a 70-amino-acid polypeptide (orf70). the properties of the putative protein encoded by orf104 and gene fusions of kika to  alkaline phosphatase by using tnphoa suggest that killing may involve an association with the bacterial membrane; however, we could not rule out the possibility that orf70 plays a role in the kik phenotype.

TI  == evidence for two phosphonate degradative pathways in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == we screened mini-mu plasmid libraries from enterobacter aerogenes ifo 12010 for plasmids that complement escherichia coli phn mutants that cannot use phosphonates (pn) as the sole source of phosphorus (p). we isolated two kinds of  plasmids that, unexpectedly, encode genes for different metabolic pathways. one kind complements e. coli mutants with both pn transport and pn catalysis genes deleted; these plasmids allow degradation of the 2-carbon-substituted pn alpha-aminoethylphosphonate but not of unsubstituted alkyl pn. this substrate specificity is characteristic of a phosphonatase pathway, which is absent in e. coli. the other kind complements e. coli mutants with pn catalysis genes deleted  but not those with both transport and catalysis genes deleted; these plasmids allow degradation of both substituted and unsubstituted pn. such a broad substrate specificity is characteristic of a carbon-phosphorus (c-p) lyase pathway, which is common in gram-negative bacteria, including e. coli. further proof that the two kinds of plasmids encode genes for different pathways was demonstrated by the lack of dna homology between the plasmids. in particular, the phosphonatase clone from e. aerogenes failed to hybridize to the e. coli phncdefghijklmnop gene cluster for pn uptake and degradation, while the e. aerogenes c-p lyase clone hybridized strongly to the e. coli phnghijklm genes encoding c-p lyase but not to the e. coli phncde genes encoding pn transport. specific hybridization by the e. aerogenes c-p lyase plasmid to the e. coli phnf, phnn, phno, and phnp genes was not determined. furthermore, we showed that one or more genes encoding the apparent e. aerogenes phosphonatase pathway, like the e.  coli phnc-to-phnp gene cluster, is under phosphate regulon control in e. coli. this highlights the importance of pn in bacterial p assimilation in nature.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the staphylococcus aureus signal peptidase ii (lsp) gene.
AB  == the lsp gene encoding prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase ii) of staphylococcus aureus was cloned by screening a genomic library for plasmid clones capable of complementing a conditionally lethal lsp allele of escherichia  coli. e. coli cells carrying one of five overlapping clones exhibited increased resistance to globomycin. the nucleotide sequence of the s. aureus lsp gene was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence of the signal peptidase ii of s. aureus suggests that this enzyme has a hydropathy profile very similar to those of e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas fluorescens. comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme from these four distinct bacterial species reveals three highly conserved domains in proteins which have a low degree of overall sequence homology. unlike the lsp genes from the gram-negative bacteria,  the lsp gene in s. aureus is not flanked by x-iles and orf149-orf316 as found in  e. coli, ent. aerogenes, and p. fluorescens.

TI  == distribution of an l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

AB  == in order to study the epidemiology of invasive enterobacter infections, data from 53 consecutive cases of bacteraemia due to this organism were compared with data  from 72 randomly selected cases of escherichia coli bacteraemia. the cases occurred among patients admitted to a danish university hospital over a 6-year period. forty-eight cases were due to enterobacter cloacae and five were due to ent. aerogenes. enterobacter bacteraemia was more often of nosocomial origin than e. coli bacteraemia and more often polymicrobial. patients suffering from enterobacter bacteraemia were younger than e. coli patients, and males tended to  predominate. apart from cancer of the prostate, other malignant diseases tended to be more frequent among patients with enterobacter bacteraemia than among e. coli patients. enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with a focus in central venous catheters and burns, whereas patients with e. coli bacteraemia more often showed a focus of infection in the urinary tract. patients with enterobacter bacteraemia and a microbiologically documented focus in the respiratory tract or the urinary tract more often had an endotracheal tube or indwelling urinary catheter compared to patients with e. coli bacteraemia with a  similar focus of infection. in patients with no microbiologically documented focus enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with the presence of central and peripheral venous catheters. during the preceding 12 weeks patients with enterobacter bacteraemia, more often than e. coli patients, had been treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, especially penicillins. the close association with  devices may indicate that enterobacter has a special affinity for foreign body material. studies are planned to elucidate this aspect in further detail.

AB  == novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus pseudomonas. we found that a new pseudomonas strain, pseudomonas flavida if-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pni10 and pni20. they were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pni10 and 2.9 kb for pni20. several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (kmr or smr) gene were constructed from pni10 and pni20. these plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid dna by the usual  competent cell method. the vectors derived from pni10 replicated not only in pseudomonas but also in some other gram-negative enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

AB  == as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population  of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.

(1987) j. bacteriol. 169, 3963-3968). the two enzymes showed 85% sequence identity and also showed 80% sequence identity with the previously sequenced (vaaler, g. l., brasch, m. a., and snell,  e. e. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 11010-11014) hisdcase of morganella morganii. nevertheless, antibodies to the m. morganii hisdcase do not cross-react with these enzymes suggesting that the regions of amino acid variations are located on the outer surface of the proteins. all three hisdcases are the same length (377 amino acid residues); encoded n-terminal methionine was completely removed in each case. these closely related pyridoxal-p enzymes show no sequence homology with the pyruvoyl-dependent hisdcases of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. seleniated trna species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond  to the 80 kda and 110 kda subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of e. coli. in those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent  upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. the similarity of the 80 kda selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. antibodies raised against the 80 kda selenopolypeptide from e. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kda polypeptide in those  organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. these organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhf gene from e. coli.  in an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhf gene homologue from enterobacter aerogenes. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame tga (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the e. coli gene. this fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, e. coli. moreover, the e. coli fdhf gene was expressed in salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.

TI  == ammonia-induced cell envelope injury in escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == ammonia-induced cell envelope injury was examined in pure cultures of escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. cell injury, as determined by the ratio of colony-forming units on m-t7 agar to colony-forming units on m-endo agar, increased with exposure to increasing concentrations of ammonia. cell envelopes appeared to be the site of injury as indicated by increasing susceptibility to lysozyme with increasing ammonia concentration. cells exposed to ammonia also exhibited more cellular leakage than control cells. leakage from cells exposed to ammonia included proteins, and all leaked substances increased in concentration as ammonia concentrations increased. the concentration of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate  (kdo) in the outer membrane of e. coli increased with ammonia exposure, while kdo concentration in the outer membrane of e. aerogenes decreased. the results suggest that exposure of e. coli cells to high concentrations of ammonia disrupts the outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide-associated proteins, while e. aerogenes cells are affected through the disruption of bonds between kdo and the outer membrane.

AB  == this report demonstrates high efficiency transduction of enteric bacteria using single strand plasmids packaged in m13 phage capsids. transformation by plasmid dna is usually a very inefficient process in many enteric bacteria other than escherichia coli k12. plasmids carrying an m13 origin of replication can be replicated and packaged when cells carrying such plasmids are infected with m13 or a derivative helper phage. by introducing an f' plasmid into e. coli, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes, these species can now be infected at high efficiency with m13 phage and with packaged single strand plasmids, yielding an efficient method to introduce cloned dna fragments into these bacteria. the titer of colony forming units in a lysate was essentially equivalent in all the bacteria, demonstrating an equal efficiency of transduction of these other enteric bacteria compared to e. coli.

AB  == a prospective cohort study was undertaken in two commercial california dairies. the treatment group, 246 cows, received three doses of a whole cell bacterin of j5 escherichia coli (mutant of e. coli o111:b4) plus freund's incomplete adjuvant vaccine (two in the dry period and one after calving) while 240 unvaccinated cows served as controls. thirty-five cases of clinical coliform mastitis were diagnosed, six in vaccinated cows and 29 in unvaccinated cows. bacteria isolated  from the clinical cases included 15 e. coli five klebsiella pneumoniae, three k.  oxytoca, three k. ozaenae, five enterobacter aerogenes, three serratia marcescens and one serratia spp. four control cows were culled, three of them because of chronic coliform mastitis and one because of postcoliform infection agalactia. incidence rate of clinical gram-negative mastitis was 2.57% in vaccinated cows and 12.77% in unvaccinated cows. the estimated risk ratio, the measure of risk of having clinical gram-negative mastitis for vaccinated cows to unvaccinated cows,  was 0.20 (p less than 0.005), indicating a strong relationship between vaccination and lack of clinical gram-negative mastitis. the results of this trial indicate that the administration of the e. coli j5 vaccine is protective against natural challenge to gram-negative bacteria, and reduces the incidence of clinical gram-negative mastitis in dairy cows during the first three months of lactation.

TI  == bacterial colonization of intravenous catheter materials in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == four different intravenous catheter materials, brands teflon, silastic, vialon, and tecoflex, were evaluated in vitro for bacterial adherence after 2 and 24 hours' incubation in trypticase soy broth and after 2 hours' incubation in nutrient-free phosphate buffer (ph 7.2). the organisms used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 x 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. there was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. these characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. it is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.

TI  == evolution of chemotactic-signal transducers in enteric bacteria.
AB  == the methyl-accepting chemotactic-signal transducers of the enteric bacteria are transmembrane proteins that consist of a periplasmic receptor domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain. to study their evolution, transducer genes from enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae were compared with transducer genes from escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. there are at least two functional transducer genes in the nonmotile species k. pneumoniae, one of which  complements the defect in serine taxis of an e. coli tsr mutant. the tse (taxis to serine) gene of e. aerogenes also complements an e. coli tsr mutant; the tas (taxis to aspartate) gene of e. aerogenes complements the defect in aspartate taxis, but not the defect in maltose taxis, of an e. coli tar mutant. the sequence was determined for 5 kilobases of e. aerogenes dna containing a 3' fragment of the chea gene, chew, tse, tas, and a 5' fragment of the cher gene. the tse and tas genes are in one operon, unlike tsr and tar. the cytoplasmic domains of tse and tas are very similar to those of e. coli and s. typhimurium transducers. the periplasmic domain of tse is homologous to that of tsr, but tas  and tar are much less similar in this region. however, several short sequences are conserved in the periplasmic domains of tsr, tar, tse, and tas but not of tap and trg, transducers that do not bind amino acids. these conserved regions include residues implicated in amino-acid binding.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and expression of the enterobacter aerogenes alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene in brewer's yeast.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 1.4-kilobase dna fragment containing the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene of enterobacter aerogenes was determined. the sequence contains an entire protein-coding region of 780 nucleotides which encodes an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase of 260 amino acids. the dna sequence  coding for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase was placed under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase i promoter of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in a plasmid capable of autonomous replication in both s. cerevisiae and escherichia coli. brewer's yeast cells transformed by this plasmid showed alpha-acetolactate  decarboxylase activity and were used in laboratory-scale fermentation experiments. these experiments revealed that the diacetyl concentration in wort fermented by the plasmid-containing yeast strain was significantly lower than that in wort fermented by the parental strain. these results indicated that the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase activity produced by brewer's yeast cells degraded alpha-acetolactate and that this degradation caused a decrease in diacetyl production.

TI  == activity of cefixime (fk 027) for resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == cefixime is an orally absorbable cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of in vitro activity for gram-negative bacteria especially members of the enterobacteriaceae. gram-negative rod isolates collected over a three month period were tested against cefixime. greater than 99% of escherichia coli isolates was susceptible to cefixime including those resistant to ampicillin. similarly isolates of klebsiella, proteus and providencia were also exquisitely susceptible to cefixime as were 91% of enterobacter cloacae and 71% of enterobacter aerogenes. killing kinetics of cefixime did not differ from that of  the intravenously administered third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime. the addition of magnesium and calcium divalent cations or the lowering of the ph to 5.0 did not affect the action of this antibiotic. the extended spectrum of this oral antibiotic may be useful in treatment of urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections caused by the more resistant gram-negative rods.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the populations ofklebsieila pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, andpseudomonas sp. fell following their addition to soil, but species  lysing these gram-negative bacteria were not detected. the numbers ofstaphylococcus aureus andmicrococcus flavus fell by more than four orders of magnitude and ofsaccharomyces cerevisiae by more than two orders after their addition to soil. organisms lysing these gram-positive bacteria were present in soil, but their numbers did not increase as a result of the additions. lytic activity againsts. aureus was detected in soil filtrates, but this activity was not enhanced by inoculation of soil with the bacterium. addition of cycloheximide to soil suspensions delayed the fall in abundance ofm. flavus but did not suppress the lytic populations. we conclude that lysis is not responsible for the decline of bacteria ors. cerevisiae added to soil.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a commercial beta-glucuronidase (beta-gur) test for the rapid and economical identification of escherichia coli was evaluated. a total of 762 clinical strains and 228 environmental isolates were studied. more than 95% of the e. coli strains were found to be beta-gur positive. thirty-one clinical isolates of shigella sonnei, 10 of enterobacter cloacae, eight of enterobacter aerogenes, nine of citrobacter freundii and one of salmonella enteritidis also gave positive results. the enzyme beta-gur was also detected in two environmental strains of e. cloacae and one c. freundii. a comparative study between the beta-gur test and the conventional identification system was carried out in 233 consecutive isolates of lactose positive enterobacteria. agreement was observed in 223 cases  and 190 e. coli strains were correctly identified using this test. discrepancies  were found in 10 cases: nine e. coli were beta-gur negative and one c. freundii was beta-gur positive. escherichia coli was the only species positive for both beta-gur and indole tests. this procedure permits a rapid, easy, precise and inexpensive identification of e. coli. beta-gur positive enterobacter strains have not previously been described.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-s.
AB  == 6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s.  epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in members of the family enterobacteriaceae from ohio.
AB  == epidemiologic studies of plasmid-mediated resistance at the cleveland veterans administration medical center revealed that related plasmids had disseminated among members of the family enterobacteriaceae. we studied the beta-lactamases encoded by these plasmids in escherichia coli c600 transformants or transconjugants. substrate and inhibition profiles of the enzymes determined by two of these plasmids suggested an activity resembling tem-1; however, isoelectric focusing revealed a pi of 7.0. these two plasmids were originally found in a serratia marcescens (pds076) and an enterobacter cloacae (pds075) strain isolated from the same sink in the medical intensive care unit and later,  in an enterobacter cloacae (pds142 identical to pds076) isolate colonizing a patient in the same unit. the plasmids also carried the aminoglycoside resistance determinant, 2"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase. a 2-kilobase avai restriction endonuclease digestion fragment of psd075 known to carry the beta-lactamase determinant was used as a molecular probe. this probe did not recognize sequences of any plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase tested including the recently described determinants rob-1, tle-1, and oxa-4-7. a tem-1 probe derived  from the 0.7-kilobase psti-ecori fragment of pbr322 failed to recognize the new beta-lactamase gene. four additional enterobacter cloacae and two enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in columbus, ohio, have been shown to produce a pi 7.0 beta-lactamase and to carry plasmids recognized by the 2-kilobase probe. these data suggest dissemination of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase among members of the family enterobacteriaceae in ohio and demonstrate the development  and utility of a molecular probe for the new determinant. we suggest that the novel beta-lactamase be named ohio-1.

AB  == the usefulness of selenite-f (s-f), tetrathionate (mkt) and rappaport-10 (r-10) broths as enrichment media to support growth of salmonellas either alone or in the presence of other competing organisms was studied. their ability to support the growth of stressed salmonellas from water was also investigated. it was observed that r-10 was more inhibitory to competing organisms than mkt and s-f. it strongly inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii  and proteus vulgaris though not of escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. it was more toxic, however, to small numbers of salmonellas than mkt and s-f. tetrathionate was strongly inhibitory for e. coli and ent. aerogenes but much less so for proteus and pseudomonas species. selenite-f was much less inhibitory  than mkt to ps. aeruginosa and it did not inhibit growth of e. coli and ent. aerogenes as much as mkt. salmonellas were inhibited by all three enrichment media and none of them is ideally suited for direct use. of the three media, r-10 was much more inhibitory to stressed organisms than s-f or mkt.

TI  == affinity of cephalosporins for beta-lactamases as a factor in antibacterial efficacy.
AB  == strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae that were resistant to ceftazidime (mic greater than 16 micrograms/ml) but susceptible to bmy 28142 (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml) were found to contain higher levels of beta-lactamase activity (50- to 3,340-fold) than control strains of the corresponding species. ceftazidime was at least as resistant as bmy 28142  to hydrolysis by these enzymes. however, the apparent ki of bmy 28142 for each enzyme was larger (8- to greater than 20-fold) than that of ceftazidime; i.e., the affinity of these enzymes for bmy 28142 appeared to be lower than that for ceftazidime. thus, bmy 28142 was affected less than ceftazidime by a mechanism of resistance that depends, at least in part, on the relative affinities of cephalosporins for the beta-lactamases of these species. these results indicate that the affinity between a beta-lactamase and a cephalosporin may be a distinguishing factor in the evaluation of beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins and suggest that affinity can play a major role in susceptibility  to highly beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins.

AB  == water samples from home filters in nine residential areas of a nigerian university community were studied. the membrane filter technique was used to determine the total coliform and faecal coliform counts/100 ml of water. most of  the 100 samples studied were grossly contaminated with total coliform counts/100  ml ranging from 0-442, faecal coliform counts/100 ml, 0-216 and the total aerobic plate count per millilitre ranged from 3.0 x 10(3) to 1.9 x 10(9) c.f.u. the source (dams) of water, fitness of filter candles, frequency of cleaning candles  and ph of water did not significantly (p greater than 0.05; chi2) affect the microbial quality of either filtered boiled or unboiled tap water. escherichia coli type i was isolated from 17.9% of the faecal coliforms tested but from only  2.3% of total coliforms. enterobacter aerogenes was most predominant (38.5%) amongst faecal coliforms isolated while enterobacter cloacae was the most frequent (37.2%) of the total coliform isolates. the gross contamination of filtered water from all households sampled calls for an enlightenment of residents on the proper use of home water filters.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == efficacy and safety of aztreonam-clindamycin versus tobramycin-clindamycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a total of 80 patients were randomized to receive either aztreonam or tobramycin  for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli; all these patients received clindamycin concomitantly. a total of 53 patients were randomized to receive aztreonam-clindamycin; of these, 46 were clinically evaluable and 39 were bacteriologically evaluable. of the 46 clinically evaluable patients, 41 were considered cured, 3 failed to be cured, and 2 died during the study period of unrelated causes. of the 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients, 36 were considered cured, and 3 failed to be cured. there were 26 clinically evaluable patients in the group randomized to  receive tobramycin-clindamycin. of them, 22 patients were considered cured, 3 failed to be cured, and 1 died of unrelated causes during the study period. there were 18 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the tobramycin-clindamycin group; 17 were cured, and 1 failed to be cured. the most common pathogens isolated from  the patients were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all of the isolated organisms were susceptible to both tested antibiotics, except for a strain of pseudomonas cepacia resistant to both tested  antimicrobial agents and a strain of enterobacter aerogenes and one of p. aeruginosa that were resistant to aztreonam. very few adverse reactions related to the antibiotics were seen. these effects, when present, were transient and comparable in both studied groups, except for renal-function tests, which were altered in 7.7% of the patients randomized to receive tobramycin-clindamycin and  in none of the patients randomized to receive aztreonam-clindamycin. aztreonam-clindamycin is safe and effective for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli when the organisms are susceptible.

TI  == dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk  diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis  for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.

TI  == [transfer of kanamycin resistance among familial strains of enterobacteriaceae isolated from a chronic bacterial carrier of salmonella schottmuelleri].
AB  == escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and s. schottmuelleri were isolated from the large intestine of a bacteriocarrier. e. coli and e. aerogenes strains proved to be resistant to a number of antibiotics. plasmids were detected in dna preparations obtained from e. coli strains. after the hybridization of these e. coli strains with e. coli c600 5k and s. schottmuelleri at 28 degrees c the transfer of resistance to kanamycin was found to occur. from some of the transconjugates thus obtained resistance to kanamycin was transferred to e. aerogenes. this resistance was found to be controlled by the plasmid with a molecular weight exceeding 2 md. the fact that s. schottmuelleri in the carrier's body retained their sensitivity to antibiotics can be explained by the absence of the transfer of plasmid kmr at a temperature exceeding 28 degrees c and by the existence of the infective agent in an ecological niche other than that of e. coli.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of fk 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  == fk 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as citrobacter and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens. fk 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative proteus species, providencia species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. with few exceptions, fk 027 was active against strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. the bactericidal activity of fk 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including proteus species, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, and s. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. the therapeutic activities of fk 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == molecular characterization of the gene coding for major outer membrane protein ompa from enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == the ompa gene from enterobacter aerogenes was subcloned into a low-copy-number plasmid vector and the resultant plasmid, ptu7en, used to study its expression in escherichia coli k12. although the gene was strongly expressed and large amounts  of ompa protein were present in the outer membrane its product was not functionally identical to the e. coli polypeptide. in particular, the e. aerogenes ompa protein was unable to confer sensitivity to ompa-specific phages of e. coli. when the primary structure of the protein was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its gene it was found that three domains differed extensively from the corresponding regions of the e. coli protein. as two of these are known to be exposed on the cell surface we inferred that these alterations are responsible for differences in the biological activity of the two proteins.

TI  == survey, purification, and properties of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms.
AB  == sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase was purified approximately 500- to 600-fold to apparent homogeneity from escherichia coli b, escherichia coli c, escherichia coli var. communior, escherichia acidilactici, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria  meningitidis, and saccharomyces cereviseae. the molecular weights of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration ranged from 97 x 10(3) to 101 x 10(3). the enzyme  was composed of two subunits with the same molecular weight which ranged from 50  x 10(3) to 52 x 10(3), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. homogeneous enzyme preparations hydrolyse all the tested alpha-d-aldohexose 1-phosphate, d-(keto or aldo)hexose 6-phosphate, and pentose phosphate substrates significantly. when the microorganisms were transferred from growth medium with 1% glucose to that without glucose, there were dramatic increases in both the specific and total enzyme activities. at least three isozymes appeared to be present in s. cereviseae, and two appeared to be present  in e. coli b, e. coli var. communior, and n. meningitidis. rabbit antiserum immunized against sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase purified from e. coli b cross-reacted with both the crude extracts and purified preparations of the enzyme from the other microorganisms. the presence of neither sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity nor immunocrossreacting material was detected in the following microorganisms: aspergillus niger, azotobacter chroococcum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumilis, citrobacter freundii, clostridium butyricum, corynebacterium xerosis, flavobacterium aquatile, flavobacterium synxanthum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, micrococcus coralinus, neisseria perflava, neurospora crassa, penicilium expansum, penicilium notatum, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas fluorescens, saccharomyces fermenti, sarcina lutea, and streptomyces antibioticus. at present, no conclusive relationship can be established between the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and the enzyme sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms. the physiological role of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase as a transferase and regulatory enzyme is discussed.

AB  == municipal water samples were analyzed by membrane filter (mf) and presence-absence (p-a) tests for pollution indicator bacteria. in four years, 11  514 bacterial cultures were isolated from either raw water, drinking water, or new main water samples submitted to three environmental laboratories. the bacterial species occurring most often in all types of water samples were escherichia coli (11.6-39.7%), enterobacter aerogenes (18.1-26.3%), aeromonas hydrophila (8.8-17.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.7-10.3%), and citrobacter freundii (5.9-22.7%). a lactose - lauryl tryptose - tryptone broth was examined as an alternative medium to modified macconkey broth in the presumptive portion of the p-a test. the intensity of acid and gas production in presumptive positive p-a bottles was compared with the types and frequencies of indicator bacteria shown by confirmatory tests. the results of detecting indicator bacteria following the analysis of 53 130 samples over a 2-year period were arranged by water source (well, lake, river, mixed) and water type (raw or drinking) to determine the influence of these parameters on the recovery of indicator bacteria. a further subdivision of the sample types into raw surface, raw ground, in-plant, plant discharge, reservoir, and distribution samples demonstrated the effect of water treatment practices.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. it was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. it had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.  it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis or listeria spp. cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam  against escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, and shigella. it inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  aerogenes, and enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration  for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), proteus vulgaris and providencia spp. it was as active as ceftizoxime was against serratia. pseudomonas spp. and bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for  90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). the compound was stable to the  common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of tem. it was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by bacteroides and acinetobacter.

TI  == influence of diluents, media, and membrane filters on detection fo injured waterborne coliform bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter freundii were injured ( greater than 90%) in water from a dead-end section of the bozeman, montana, distribution system. the effects of the following laboratory variables on the enumeration efficiency of injured and undamaged control cells were examined: (i) diluent composition, temperature, and  time of exposure; (ii) media, using various formulations employed in enumerating  gram-negative bacteria; and (iii) surface pore morphology of membrane filters. the addition of peptone or milk solids to diluents and low temperature (4 degrees c) maximized the recovery of injured cells, but had little effect on undamaged cells. control cells were recovered with high efficiencies on most media tested,  but recoveries of injured cells ranged from 0 to near 100%. most of the media commonly used in water analysis recovered less than 30% of injured cells. this was explained in part by the sensitivity of injured bacteria to deoxycholate concentrations greater than 0.01%, whereas control cells were unaffected by 0.1%. membrane filter surface pore morphology (at 35 degrees c) had a negligible effect on total coliform recoveries. recommendations are made regarding procedures to improve the recovery of injured coliforms by routine laboratory practices.

TI  == augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

AB  == single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to  determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition  of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be  quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.

TI  == competition of beta-lactam antibiotics for the penicillin-binding proteins of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli: comparison with antibacterial activity and effects upon bacterial morphology.
AB  == the competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli has been studied. the results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, pbp patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in e. coli k-12. comparison of  the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various pbps of the five  strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  == microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20c and at -70c of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella as test organisms. the stability at -20c and -70c of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using staphylococcus eureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  enterococcus, and alpha streptococcus as the test organisms. no significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70c, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. no significant differences were noted at -20c for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. by ten  weeks' storage at -20c, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin,  ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.

TI  == bacteriocin typing of serratia marcescens. a simplified system.
AB  == the authors describe a simplified system for the detection of bacteriocin production by serratia marcescens with the use of six indicator strains, which include escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes (two strains), and serratia rubidaea grown on arabinose minimal medium plates. of the 64 possible bacteriocin types, 11 were observed; 66% of the isolates tested were found to be one of three types. occasionally more than one bacteriocin type was observed in an individual specimen; however, serotyping or antibiograms, or both, also indicated this was a different strain.  the marcescin types were stable markers. with the use of this technic, different  endemic strains of serratia were shown to predominate in various areas of the hospital. in addition, when urinary tract isolates were compared with respiratory tract isolates, significant differences were found in the predominate types. the  typing of these isolates by bacteriocin production was supported by serotype and  antibiotype findings. the results suggest that this simple system may be a useful tool in a general hospital.

TI  == [on the contamination of the citric acid fermentation. i. the contamination by representatives of enterobacteriaceae (author's transl)].
AB  == among the most dangerous bacterial contaminations of the citric acid fermentation is the so-called brown contamination, which is called forth by non pathogenic representatives of enterobacteriaceae like escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, while other bacteria do not produce the mentioned contamination. there is given a comprehensive characterization of the brown contamination. enterobacteriaceae interrupt the growth of the mycelium of the mold aspergillus niger and stop the production of citric acid, produce a characteristic repugnant smell and reduce nitrate to nitrite. in a case of weak contamination the phenomena of the brown contamination do not appear, but the yield of citric acid is rather low. the contamination may  be transferred successfully within the first 24 hrs. of incubation. the effect of the bacteria is determined by their virulence and some other factors.

TI  == comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella species, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. streptococci including streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter and indole-positive proteus species were resistant. at concentrations close to mic value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against e. coli and against s. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == intracellular distribution of enzymes of phospholipid metabolism in several gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [coliform bacteria in raw and pasteurized milk].
AB  == studied were 360 samples of raw and 1404 samples of pasteurized milk, collected from three milk centers, for the presence of coliform bacteria. it was found that the coli titer of the raw milk varied from 10(-5) up to 10(-7), depending on the  season. the regimes of pasteurization applied kill 100 per cent of the present coli organisms. after the thermic treatment the milk was additionally contaminated with coli forms from the containers and the equipment in dependence  on the conditions of washing and disinfection. the coli titer of the pasteurized  milk varied from 1 to 10(-3). a total of 602 strains of coliform bacteria were isolated from the pasteurized and the raw milk; the bacteria were differentiated  by the scheme of kauffmann. most commonly encountered were the coli forms of the  following genera:citrobacter (35 per cent), enterobacter (29.8 per cent), klebsiella (23.9 per cent), and escherichia (11.3 per cent). the following species were prevailing in raw milk: kl. aerogenes, ent. aerogenes, ent. cloacae, c. freundi, and c. intermedium. in pasteurized milk dominating were kl. aerogenes, c. freundi. ent. aerogenes, and ent. cloacae.

AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == in vitro growth inhibition of mastitis-causing coliform bacteria by bovine apo-lactoferrin and reversal of inhibition by citrate and high concentrations of  apo-lactoferin.
AB  == bovine apo-lactoferrin (apo-lf) was added to in vitro cultures of eight strains of coliform bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. as little as 0.02 mg of apo-lf per ml resulted in marked inhibition of growth of all coliforms. growth inhibition was lost if saturated lf or iron plus apo-lf was added to the synthetic medium. the inhibition of growth increased as the concentration of apo-lf increased from 0.02 to 0.2 mg/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae (oardc-a1), klebsiella spp. (k1-21), and aerobacter aerogenes (55-12222) and 2 mg/ml for a. aerogenes (76-2414-1), escherichia coli (60-lilly), e. coli (66-s16), and klebsiella spp. (k6-24). as the concentration of apo-lf was increased above 0.2 or 2 mg/ml, there was less inhibition of growth except for e. coli (33-c4). apo-lf at 20 mg/ml was bactericidal for e. coli (33-c4). results are compatible with the hypothesis that coliform bacteria respond to low-iron environments by production of iron-sequestering agents that complete effectively with apo-lf for  free iron. addition of apo-lf plus citrate resulted in loss of growth inhibition. the molar ratio (citrate to apo-lf) was found to be more important than the absolute concentration of either component. a ratio of 75 resulted in 50% growth  inhibition, whereas ratios of 300 and greater resulted in less than 10% growth inhibition. these results suggest that the ratio of citrate to lf would be important in evaluating lf as a nonspecific protective factor of bovine mammary secretions.

TI  == acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) by enterobacteriaceae isolated from paper mill process waters.
AB  == using selective media containing galactitol, over 130 enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from paper mill process waters collected from different localities. these bacteria were extensively characterized and tested for acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) activity under anaerobic conditions. high activity was found in representatives of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, erwinia herbicola, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter intermedius, and escherichia coli. under argon, nitrogenase synthesis was generally not repressed  by 5 mm l-glutamate, l-aspartate, l-leucine or casamino acids (0.5 g/liter). in many strains, both the specific activities (nanomoles of c(2)h(4) per minute per  milligram of protein) and the activities (nanomoles of c(2)h(4) per minute) had considerably declined after 24 h. in three selected strains, activity in intact cells grown under nitrogen was unaffected by the presence during assay of 10 mm l-amino acids or ammonium acetate. all of the strains examined were tolerant towards inactivation of nitrogen-fixing activity by 1.8% (vol/vol) oxygen during  assay, and inactivation by up to 10% oxygen was partly reversible. representatives of the six taxa synthesized nitrogenase in stirred aerobic cultures, though the protein concentrations attained were lower than under anaerobic conditions. it seems reasonable to suggest that under natural conditions, nitrogen fixation is able to contribute significantly to the nitrogen economy of the cells.

TI  == kinetic properties of serratia marcescens adenosine 5'-diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase.
AB  == the regulatory properties of partially purified adenosine 5'-diphosphate-(adp) glucose pyrophosphorylase from two serratia marcescens strains (atcc 274 and atcc 15365) have been studied. slight or negligible activation by fructose-p2, pyridoxal-phosphate, or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) was observed. these compounds were previously shown to be potent activators of the adpglucose pyrophosphorylases from the enterics, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii,  escherichia aurescens, shigella dysenteriae, and escherichia coli. phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated the rate of adpglucose synthesis catalyzed by serratia adpglucose pyrophosphorylase about 1.5- to 2-fold but did not affect the s0.5 values (concentration of substrate required for 50% maximal stimulation) of  the substrates, alpha-glucose-1-phosphate, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate. adenosine 5'-monophosphate (amp), a potent inhibitor of the enteric adpglucose pyrophosphorylase, is an effective inhibitor of the s. marcescens enzyme. adp also inhibits but is not as effective as amp. activators of the enteric enzyme counteract the inhibition caused by amp. this is in contrast to what is observed  for the s. marcescens enzyme. neither phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose-diphosphate,  pyridoxal-phosphate, nadph, 3-phosphoglycerate, fructose-6-phosphate, nor pyruvate effect the inhibition caused by amp. the properties of the s. marcescens hy strain and serratia liquefaciens adpglucose pyrophosphorylase were found to be similar to the above two s. marcescens enzymes with respect to activation and inhibition. these observations provide another example where the properties of an enzyme found in the genus serratia have been found to be different from the properties of the same enzyme present in the enteric genera escherichia, salmonella, shigella, citrobacter, and enterobacter.

TI  == regulation of enzyme formation in klebsiella aerogenes by episomal glutamine synthetase of escherichia coli.
AB  == we studied the physiology of cells of klebsiella aerogenes containing the structural gene for glutamine synthetase (glna) of escherichia coli on an episome. the e. coli glutamine synthetase functioned in cells of k. aerogenes in  a manner similar to that of the k. aerogenes enzyme: it allowed the level of histidase to increase and that of glutamate dehydrogenase to decrease during nitrogen-limited growth. the phenotype of mutations in the glna site was restored to normal by the introduction of the episomal glna+ gene. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that glutamine synthetase regulates the function of its own structural gene.

AB  == cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. studies  were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. at obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. in agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive proteus but not enterobacter. moreover, in broth medium most strains of enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. however, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive proteus. cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of e. coli. these data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive proteus species as well as some other enterobacteriaceae. on the other hand, with the exception of strains of enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and  not in broth.

AB  == rhizobium strains (one each of rh. japonicum, rh. lupini, rh. leguminosarum) take up 2-ketoglutaric acid in general much faster and from lower concentrations in the medium than strains of escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and chromobacterium violaceum. a strain of enterobacter aerogenes, however, is more similar to some rhizobium strains. the same strains of rhizobium take up also phosphate much faster and from lower concentrations than the other bacteria tested. 4 strains of rh. lupini proved to be significantly different from 4 strains of rh. trifolii in taking up l-glutamic acid from three to ten times lower concentration within 5 h. a similar difference was noticed between 5 strains of rh. leguminosarum and 2 strains of rh. japonicum for the uptake of 2-ketoglutaric acid and of l-glutamic acid. isolated bacteroids from nodules of glycine max var. chippeway have a reduced uptake capacity for glutamic acid and for 2-ketoglutaric acid during the first 10-12 h, but reach the same value after  24 h as free living rh. japonicum cells. the differences in the uptake kinetics are independent of cell concentration. the group ii rhizobium strains (rh. japonicum and rh. lupini, slow growing rhizobium) are characterized by a rapid uptake of glutamic acid to a low remaining concentration of 1-3 x 10(-7) m and an uptake of 2-ketoglutaric acid to a remaining concentration of 2-5 x 10(-7) m. the group i rhizobium strains (rh. trifolii and rh. leguminosarum, fast growing rhizobium), can be characterized by a much slower uptake of both substances with  a more than ten times higher concentration of both metabolites remaining in the medium after the same time.

TI  == construction of intergeneric hybrids using bacteriophage p1cm: transfer of the klebsiella aerogenes ribitol dehydrogenase gene to escherichia coli.
AB  == study of many of the interesting properties of klebsiella aerogenes is limited by the lack of a well-characterized genetic system for this organism. our investigations of the evolution of the enzyme ribitol dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.56) in k. aerogenes would be greatly facilitated by the availability of such a system, and we here report two approaches to developing one. we have isolated mutants sensitive to the coliphage p1, which will efficiently tranduce genetic markers between such sensitive strains and which will thus make detailed mapping  studies possible. derivatives of k. aerogenes lysogenic for p1 can be readily isolated by using the specialized transducing particle p1cmclr100. bacteria lysogenic for this phage are chloramphenicol resistant and temperature sensitive. phage particles produced by temperature induction of such lysogens can be used to transfer k. aerogenes genes to the natural host of p1 phage. escherichia coli. we have used this method to prepare derivatives of e. coli k-12 carrying the k. aerogenes genes conferring the ability to metabolize the pentitols ribitol and d-arabitol. we have shown that these e. coli-k. aerogenes hybrids synthesize a ribitol dehydrogenase with the properties of the k. aerogenes enzyme and have mapped the position of the transferred gene on the e. coli chromosome. the ramifications of this methodology are discussed.

TI  == reversible inactivation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase of escherichia coli ml308 during growth on acetate.
AB  == during aerobic growth of escherichia coli ml308 on acetate as sole carbon source, the apparent synthesis of isocitrate dehydrogenase was repressed relative to cultures on other carbon sources, such as glucose, which do not employ the glyoxylate bypass as an anaplerotic sequence. when cells were removed from an acetate medium, or when compounds were added which made the operation of the glyoxylate bypass unnecessary, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase rapidly increased 3- to 4-fold but fell again on restoration to an acetate medium. changes in activity were rapid and, furthermore, could be demonstrated in the absence of protein synthesis. it is thus improbable that the mechanism involved degradation or de novo synthesis of the enzyme protein. oxaloacetate and glyoxylate showed concerted inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase which could be relieved by dialysis. because extracts of low enzyme activity, derived from acetate-metabolizing cells, could not be stimulated by dialysis or by addition of a wide range of metabolites, it is unlikely that low molecular weight, freely dissociable effectors were responsible for stimulation or inhibition of activity. control of isocitrate dehydrogenase permitted the efficient utilization of acetate as sole source of carbon and energy but perserved the capacity of the cell to respond rapidly to an improvement in nutritional conditions. a limited survey showed that the mechanism is common but not universal among strains of e.  coli and occurs in at least one strain each of klebsiella aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium and serratia marcescens.

AB  == a modified large-volume sampler was demonstrated to be an efficient device for the collection of mono-disperse aerosols of rhodamine b and poly-disperse aerosols of bacterial cells. absolute efficiency for collection of rhodamine b varied from 100% with 5-mum particles to about 70% with 0.5-mum particles. the sampler concentrated the particles from 950 liters of air into a flow of between  1 and 2 ml of collecting fluid per min. spores of bacillus subtilis var. niger were collected at an efficiency of about 82% compared to the collection in the standard agi-30 sampler. in the most desirable collecting fluids tested, aerosolized cells of serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, and aerobacter aerogenes were collected at comparative efficiencies of approximately 90, 80, and 90%, respectively. the modified sampler has practical application in the study of aerosol transmission of respiratory pathogens.

TI  == analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  == the biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3h]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. a variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier  protein component of acetyl-coa carboxylase, to multiple species in enterobacter  aerogenes, pseudomonas citronellolis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium shermanii, lactobacillus plantarum, and mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-coa carboxylase, respectively. thus in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.

TI  == glutamine-binding subunit of glutamate synthase and partial reactions catalyzed by this glutamine amidotransferase.
AB  == in the course of studies on glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase from aerobacter aerogenes, we purified another protein which was found to be glutamate synthase (ec 2.6.1.53). the enzyme, obtained in apparently homogeneous  form (monomer molecular weight about 227,000; s(20,omega) = 17.6 s), was found to be a typical glutamine amidotransferase in that it exhibits glutaminase activity  and can utilize ammonia in place of glutamine as a nitrogen donor. the enzyme also catalyzes at low rates the oxidative deamination of glutamate in the presence of tpn, and it exhibits tpnh oxidase activity. the enzyme is similar to  the glutamate synthase found in escherichia coli in that it is an iron-sulfide flavoprotein. treatment of the enzyme with sodium dodecyl sulfate or potassium thiocyanate dissociates it into nonidentical subunits exhibiting molecular weights of about 175,000 and 51,500. the glutamine-dependent activity of the enzyme is inhibited by l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid, but this chloroketone analog of glutamine does not affect the ammonia-dependent glutamate  synthase activity. studies with [(14)c]chloroketone show that the reagent binds to the heavy subunit only. inhibition by the chloroketone and its binding to the  heavy subunit are markedly reduced in the presence of l-glutamine. sedimentation  velocity studies carried out in potassium thiocyanate indicate that iron-sulfide  and flavin sites are also located on the heavy subunit. while these studies show  that glutamate synthase resembles other glutamine amidotransferases in certain of its catalytic properties, the findings indicate that the light subunit of this enzyme, in contrast to that of several other glutamine amidotransferases, does not function to bind glutamine. it is of interest that the enzyme exhibits an unusually high affinity for ammonia as compared to a number of other glutamine amidotransferases. glutamate synthase is inhibited (competitively with respect to glutamine) by low concentrations of methionine sulfone, methionine sulfoximine, and methionine sulfoxide.

TI  == newer aminoglycosides--amikacin and tobramycin: an in-vitro comparison with kanamycin and gentamicin.
AB  == tobramycin and amikacin are new aminoglycoside antibiotics which resemble gentamicin and kanamycin respectively in pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and some microbiological respects. minimum inhibitory concentrations for these four antibiotics have been determined against 393 bacterial strains (13 species from eight genera) isolated from clinical materialkanamycin was the least active, 89%  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains being resistant. resistance was also found  in 21% of the klebsiella aerogenes, 16% of the indoleproducing proteus species, 4% of the e. coli and 3% of the enterobacter spp. tested. providenca stuartii strains were often resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin.apart from these exceptions, however, all the organisms tested were sensitive to all four compounds, gentamicin and tobramycin usually showing the highest intrinsic activity.amikacin was the most active compound against a selection of strains chosen because of their resistance to one or more of the aminoglycosides. thus, amikacin represents a significant advance over kanamycin and seems to be superior to gentamicin in terms of its in-vitro properties. this is especially the case in those unusual circumstances when gentamicin-resistant strains are a problem. we suggest that amikacin warrants further investigation since it may prove to be a valuable alternative to gentamicin in the treatment of life-threatening infections.

TI  == evaluating the membrane fecal coliform test by using escherichia coli as the indicator organism.
AB  == the fecal coliform membrane filter method (mfc) currently used in water pollution analysis was evaluated by using two strains of escherichia coli, a known fecal coliform, as the indicator organism. a large relative error in the results obtained with this method was found to be dependent upon the brand of membrane filter employed, the medium, and the temperature of incubation. mfc densities varied between 10 and 60% of the densities determined by means of total bacteria  counts and total coliform counts performed at 35 c. due to the large relative error encountered, the mfc method cannot be recommended as an analytical tool for the laboratory enumeration of e. coli. the results do show that the mfc method can be used at 35 c for enumeration of e. coli and for differential counts of e.  coli and enterobacter aerogenes.

TI  == pressure transducer method for measuring gas production by microorganisms.
AB  == a simple method for measuring gas production by microorganisms by using a pressure transducer to sense pressure buildup was developed and tested with members of the coliform group. the test system consisted of a 5.0 lb/in(2) pressure transducer and a pressure equalizer valve attached to the metal cap of a test tube (20 by 150 mm); gas pressure was recorded on a strip-chart recorder. gas pressure response curves consisted of (i) a lag period with no marked increase in pressure, (ii) a rapid pressure buildup period, and (iii) a leveling-off period. a linear relationship was established between inoculum size  and length of the lag period. cultures shaken at 200 oscillations/min showed a marked increase in rate of gas release over stationary cultures. cell concentrations at the time of rapid buildup in pressure were 10(8)/ml. mean maximum pressure recordings, lb/in(2) per 10 ml of broth, were: enterobacter aerogenes, 3.70; citrobacter intermedium, 2.70; and escherichia coli, 2.10. mean  co(2) concentrations, ppm of headspace gas, for e. coli were: (i) 2,000 at time of inoculation, (ii) 25,000 at time of rapid buildup in pressure, and (iii) 150,000 at maximum pressure. these results indicate the potential application of  the pressure transducer method for rapidly detecting coliforms and other gas-producing microorganisms in clinical samples and in sterility testing of foods.

TI  == methods for visualization of enzymes in polyacrylamide gels.
AB  == white bands resulting from precipitation of dodecan-1-ol liberated by hydrolysis  of sodium dodecyl sulfate and decan-5-ol released by hydrolysis of decan-5-yl sulfate produced zymograms of the primary and secondary alkylsulfatases from pseudomonas c(12)b. gas-liquid chromatographic analyses of ether extracts of the  precipitate-containing segments of the zymograms confirmed the identity of the alcohols which were not discerned in extracts of segments of the gels other than  those containing precipitates. beta-galactosidase from escherichia coli was marked on zymograms by the liberation of o-nitrophenol from o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside, and arylsulfatase from pseudomonas c(12)b was marked in gels by liberation of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl sulfate. membrane-associated dissimilatory nitrate reductases from a nitrate respirer (enterobacter aerogenes) and a denitrifier (pseudomonas perfectomarinus) did not  penetrate either 6.8 or 3% polyacrylamide gel but were demonstrable at the top of the gels. in the membrane-bound state, formate served as electron donor for nitrate reductase from e. aerogenes, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) served as donor for nitrate reductase from p. perfectomarinus. both enzymes reduced nitrate at the expense of reduced benzyl viologen as well. assimilatory nitrate reductase from e. aerogenes moved easily into the 6.8% gels (r(f) = 0.43 under the conditions of these experiments). the reduced dye served as electron donor for the assimilatory reductase, but formate  and nadh did not. incubation of the membrane-associated nitrate reductases with 2% triton x-100 solubilized the enzymes and removed the capacity of formate and nadh to serve as electron donors. both retained the ability to reduce nitrate at  the expense of reduced benzyl viologen. the solubilized dissimilatory reductase from e. aerogenes moved further in the gels (r(f) = 0.49) than the soluble assimilatory reductase; the solubilized dissimilatory reductase from the denitrifier, p. perfectomarinus, moved further in the gels (r(f) = 0.64) than either of the enzymes from e. aerogenes.

AB  == 1. anthranilate synthase and phosphoribosyltransferase from aerobacter aerogenes  purify simultaneously and sediment together on sucrose gradients, showing that they occur as an enzyme aggregate. both activities of the intact aggregate are subject to inhibition by tryptophan. 2. by using appropriate auxotrophic mutants  it was shown that an intact active enzyme aggregate is formed when the components come from separate mutant strains. an intact active aggregate can also be formed  when one component is from escherichia coli and the other from a. aerogenes. 3. phosphoribosyltransferase of a. aerogenes is active when not in an aggregate with anthranilate synthase, but is not subject to tryptophan inhibition, indicating that the inhibitor site is on the anthranilate synthase component. 4. anthranilate synthase can be active and sensitive to tryptophan inhibition when complexed with an inactive phosphoribosyltransferase. 5. kinetic studies on the anthranilate synthase activity show that tryptophan is a competitive inhibitor with respect to chorismate and a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to either glutamine or nh(4) (+) ions. this is consistent with a sequential mechanism of the ordered type in which chorismate is the first reactant.

TI  == enterobacteria in feedlot waste and runoff.
AB  == samples of beef cattle feedlot waste (flw), runoff from the pens, and water from  a large drainage ditch at the feedlot were examined for enterobacteriaceae. the drainage ditch receives the runoff but contains primarily subsurface drainage from fields on which flw is spread for disposal. planting and enrichment techniques with seven different media were used to isolate 553 cultures of enterobacteria. flw contains about 50 million enterobacteria/g dry weight. more than 90% of these were escherichia coli, none of which were enteropathogenic types as determined with multivalent sera. citrobacter and enterobacter cloacae were other organisms present in moderate numbers. application of enrichment techniques broadened the spectrum of enterobacteria isolates to include the four  proteus spp., both providencia spp., klebsiella, enterobacter aerogenes, arizona, and a single isolate of salmonella (serological group c(2)). shigella was not isolated. the wide spectrum of enterobacteria in flw may be a hazard if unsterilized waste is refed. fewer enterobacteria occurred in the runoff and in the drainage ditch; the most numerous species in flw also were most numerous at these sites. however, neither salmonella nor arizona was isolated from runoff or  drainage-ditch waters.

AB  == enteric bacteria, including stocked strains of pathogenic species and organisms naturally present in the stream, were capable of growth in a chemostat with autoclaved river water taken 750 m below a sewage outfall. maximal specific growth rates for all organisms occurred at 30 c, whereas culture generation times ranged between 33.3 and 116 hr. of the six laboratory strains of enteric species  used, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes grew at generation times of 34.5 and 33.3 hr, respectively, while the remaining proteus, arizona, salmonella, and shigella spp. reproduced at a rate two to three times slower than the coliforms. little or no growth occurred in the water at incubation temperatures of 20 and 5 c, and death was observed for salmonella senftenberg at 20 and 5 c and for e. aerogenes and proteus rettgeri at 5 c. when enteric bacteria naturally present in the river water were employed in similar experiments, coliform bacteria demonstrated a generation time of approximately 116 hr, whereas fecal coliforms failed to grow. growth of the bacteria from the river demonstrated a periodicity of approximately 100 hr, which suggests that much of the growth of these organisms in the chemostat may be on the glass surfaces. this phenomenon, however, was not observed with any of the stocked enteric species. neither the stock cultures nor the aquatic strains were capable of growth in autoclaved river water taken above the sewage outfall at the three temperatures tested.

AB  == the beta(2) subunits of tryptophan synthetase, formula alpha(2)beta(2), from escherichia coli, shigella dysenteriae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and serratia marcescens were compared by three criteria. (i) alphabeta association constants for the various beta(2) subunits and e. coli alpha subunit varied between 3.6 x 10(8)m(-1) for e. coli and 0.33 x 10(8)m(-1) for s. marcescens; values for the other organisms were intermediate. (ii) antiserum neutralization of the beta(2) subunit enzyme activity using anti-e. coli beta(2) serum showed significant cross-reaction among the organisms (e. coli, 1.0; s. dysenteriae, 0.98; s. typhimurium, 0.67; e. aerogenes, 0.61; s. marcescens, 0.42). (iii) quantitative microcomplement fixation showed e. coli beta(2) and s. marcescens beta(2) subunits to have an index of dissimilarity of 1.8 while the other organisms had intermediate indexes. similar complement fixation data were obtained with antisera from separate rabbits and from first course and boost sera. these findings suggest that the general surface structure  and the respective alpha subunit binding site of the beta(2) subunits from these  enterobacteriaceae have been strongly conserved.

TI  == experimental technique for studying aerosols of lyophilized bacteria.
AB  == an experimental technique is presented for studying aerosols generated from lyophilized bacteria by using escherichia coli b, bacillus subtilis var. niger, enterobacter aerogenes, and pasteurella tularensis. an aerosol generator capable  of creating fine particle aerosols of small quantities (10 mg) of lyophilized powder under controlled conditions of exposure to the atmosphere is described. the physical properties of the aerosols are investigated as to the distribution of number of aerosol particles with particle size as well as to the distribution  of number of bacteria with particle size. biologically unstable vegetative cells  were quantitated physically by using (14)c and europium chelate stain as tracers, whereas the stable heat-shocked b. subtilis spores were assayed biologically. the physical persistence of the lyophilized b. subtilis aerosol is investigated as a  function of size of spore-containing particles. the experimental result that physical persistence of the aerosol in a closed aerosol chamber increases as particle size is decreased is satisfactorily explained on the bases of electrostatic, gravitational, inertial, and diffusion forces operating to remove  particles from the particular aerosol system. the net effect of these various forces is to provide, after a short time interval in the system (about 2 min), an aerosol of fine particles with enhanced physical stability. the dependence of physical stability of the aerosol on the species of organism and the nature of the suspending medium for lyophilization is indicated. also, limitations and general applicability of both the technique and results are discussed.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == taxonomic investigations on expressed and cryptic phospho-beta-glucosidases in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == in the enterobacteriaceae, beta-glucosides are catabolized by a complex system formed of three permeases, with partly overlapping substrate specificities, and two hydrolytic enzymes, phospho-beta-glucosidase a and b, which hydrolyze only phosphorylated beta-glucosides. some enterobacteriaceae such as klebsiella-aerobacter (enterobacter) possess the complete system; others possess  only parts of it or may have a cryptic phospho-beta-glucosidase activity without  permease activity. a screening test applied to strains belonging to several genera of enterobacteriaceae showed that strains of citrobacter, hafnia, and serratia exhibit a degree of similarity in phospho-beta-glucosidase activity and  inducibility which could be useful in their taxonomic characterization; others, such as aerobacter aerogenes, erwinia, and proteus vulgaris, are more heterologous. owing to the presence of inducible phospho-beta-glucosidases a and  b in citrobacter, the fermentation of beta-methyl glucoside and the fermentation  of arbutin in mixture with cellobiose could be of diagnostic value in the differentiation of citrobacter from salmonella. wild-type strains of escherichia  coli, shigella, and salmonella are phenotypically similar in their inability to catabolize beta-glucosides, the presence of constitutive p-beta-glucosidase a, and the lack of beta-glucoside permeases i and ii. their beta-glucoside-fermenting mutants show, however, a phospho-beta-glucosidase and beta-glucoside permease activity which is characteristic for mutants from each genus. the differences in the phenotype of the mutants reflect probable differences in the presence of cryptic genes in the wild-type strains and could be of evolutionary significance.

TI  == organization of enzymes in the polyaromatic synthetic pathway: separability in bacteria.
AB  == ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients was employed to estimate the molecular weights and to determine possible physical aggregation of the five enzymes catalyzing steps two to six in the prechorismic acid portion of the polyaromatic synthetic pathway in six species of bacteria: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, aerobacter aerogenes, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptomyces coelicolor. the five enzymes were not aggregated in  extracts of any of the species examined, nor are the genes encoding these enzymes clustered in those bacterial species for which genetic evidence exists. (an initial examination of the blue-green alga anabaena variabilis indicates nonaggregation in this species also.) this situation in bacteria is in marked contrast to that found in neurospora crassa and other fungi in which the same five enzymes are associated as an aggregate encoded (at least in the case of n. crassa) by a cluster of five genes. in addition, also in contrast to n. crassa, no evidence was obtained for more than one kind of dehydroquinase activity in any of the bacteria examined. these comparative results are discussed in relation to  the origin, evolution, and functional significance of the gene-enzyme relationships existing in the early steps of aromatic biosynthesis in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == capacity of aspartic acid to increase the bacterial count on suspensions of escherichia coli after freezing.
AB  == the addition of 2% trypticase to a minimal salts-glucose plating medium increased the bacterial count of frozen and thawed suspensions of escherichia coli 451b cells, even when precautions were taken to remove toxic trace elements from the plating diluent. hydrolysis of the trypticase with hcl or h(2)so(4) reduced its count-increasing activity. treatment of the h(2)so(4) hydrolysate with a cation-exchange resin greatly improved its capacity to replace trypticase. addition of a mixture of amino acids approximating the composition of casein also increased the plate count when added at a level equivalent to 0.1% casein, but at 2% it depressed the count. tests of amino acids in the mixture revealed that aspartic acid could replace trypticase completely as a supplement to the basal medium. when added at a level of 2.5 mm, aspartic acid doubled and occasionally tripled the plate count of a suspension of frozen and thawed cells. glutamic acid, alanine, and to a lesser extent certain other amino acids also showed a capacity to increase the count. cysteine was without significant effect. serine and other amino acids depressed the count. none of the amino acids or other supplements affected the count of suspensions of cells that had not been frozen.  the effect of adding aspartic acid, cysteine, or trypticase to the basal medium on the bacterial count of suspensions of various strains of e. coli, aerobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and two species of pseudomonas after freezing was examined. the response to the supplements was unique for each organism.

TI  == polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. in only three cases: escherichia coli-shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium-s. typhi, and proteus mirabilis-p. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. in most cases interspecies dna duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies dna reassociation reactions. the stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 c was virtually identical to that of homologous e. coli dna duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected  by the temperature increase (86% at 60 c; 77% at 75 c). the thermal stability of  dna duplexes formed at 60 c between dna from e. coli and dna from strains of aerobacter aerogenes, s. typhimurium, s. typhi, and p. mirabilis was about 12 to  14 c below that of reassociated e. coli dna. at 75 c, the formation of the interspecific dna duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the dna able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated e. coli dna. the degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. the other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their dna can reanneal with e. coli dna at 60 c and less than 10% reacts at 75 c. the degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the dna molecule. ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rna)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. an examination of messenger rna relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less  than the genome as a whole.

TI  == immunochemical and enzymatic comparisons of the tryptophan synthase alpha subunits from five species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the reactive surface structures of alpha subunits of tryptophan synthase from escherichia coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, aerobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens were compared by measuring (i) their reactivities in micro-complement-fixation assays with antibodies directed specifically to e. coli wild-type alpha subunit, (ii) their reactivities in enzyme neutralization assays with the same antibodies, and (iii) their binding affinities for tryptophan synthase beta(2) subunits. the enzymes from the four heterologous species cross-reacted in the microcomplement-fixation assays with the anti-e. coli alpha subunit antibodies, each to a different degree. however, neutralization titers of the antibodies reacting with the various alpha subunits  were comparatively similar, and the beta(2) subunit-binding and -stimulating abilities of the alpha subunits were even more closely alike. the results suggested that the tertiary structure of the beta(2) subunit-binding site of the  alpha subunit has been conserved, relative to the rest of the molecule, during the evolutionary divergence of the species of enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == induction of adenosine deaminase in escherichia coli.
AB  == supplementing the salts-glucose medium of escherichia coli with adenine initiates induction of adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, ec 3.5.4.4), growth inhibition, and an increased potential for the net deamination of adenine. the extent and duration of these events are proportional to the initial adenine concentration and are dependent upon adenylate pyrophosphorylase and repression of histidine biosynthesis for maximal expression. the conversion of adenine to hypoxanthine, though limited in rate, occurs concurrently with induction and accounts for the progressively decreasing rate of deaminase induction, since hypoxanthine is a relatively ineffective inducer. the subsequent decrease in deaminase activity is due to dilution by continued cell division and by enzyme inactivation which occurs during the late-log and early-stationary phases. the partially purified deaminase is labile to a number of environmental conditions, particularly to phosphate buffers of ph 6.8 or less. a disproportionately slow rate of adenine deamination by cells utilizing lactate permits a more prolonged period of induction and, consequently, a greater quantity of enzyme to be synthesized; cell division, but not enzyme inactivation, reduces enzyme concentration. the adenosine deaminases of aerobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhimurium are not inducible.

TI  == biosynthesis of diacetyl in bacteria and yeast.
AB  == both diacetyl and acetoin were produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, aerobacter aerogenes, lactobacillus brevis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae 299, whereas only acetoin was produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of streptococcus lactis, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, and s. cerevisiae strains 513 and 522. cell-free extracts that produced diacetyl did not produce it from acetoin; they produced it from pyruvate, but only if acetyl-coenzyme a was was added to the reaction mixtures. production of diacetyl by s. cerevisiae 299 was prevented by valine, inhibited by sodium arsenite, and stimulated by pantothenic acid. valine did not prevent the production of acetoin. e. coli and the three strains of s. cerevisiae did not decarboxylate alpha-acetolactate but did use acetaldehyde in the production of acetoin from pyruvate. the other organisms produced acetoin from pyruvate via alpha-acetolactate.

AB  == a membrane culture technique was developed for directly exposing microorganisms to test atmospheres. inhibition and killing were calculated from comparisons with air-grown cultures. direct colony counts were used with low inocula. with mass inocula, plate colony counts and optical-density measurements were made on resuspended filter populations. bacteria, including escherichia coli, were more sensitive to oxygen than previously reported. with inocula of a few hundred cells per membrane, five of seven species failed to produce colonies while exposed to oxygen at one atmosphere. upon reincubation in air, the survival of five species  ranged from near 0 to 12% of the cells. aerobacter aerogenes was neither inhibited nor killed. with this technique, bacteria are in direct contact with the test atmosphere and cells which survive are detected but do not obscure the response of other cells in the population.

AB  == a study of the inhibitory effect of 24 different combinations of brilliant green  and bile salts concentrations was conducted, using seven species of microorganisms capable of fermenting mannitol. the inhibitory effect of brilliant green decreased as the bile salts concentration was increased. staphylococcus aureus and proteus rettgeri were inhibited by all test media. escherichia coli was inhibited in all but two combinations of brilliant green and bile salts. aerobacter aerogenes generally followed a pattern of growth similar to that of three species of salmonellae. three of the 24 combinations of brilliant green and bile salts showed little or no inhibition of salmonellae but did inhibit the other organisms studied.

AB  == the effect of aqueous extracts of carob (ceratonia siliqua) pods, gallotannic acid, gallic acid, and catechol on several microorganisms was studied. carob pod  extract and tannic acid showed a strong antimicrobial activity toward some cellulolytic bacteria. on the basis of tannin content, to which antimicrobial effect was related, carob pod extracts inhibited cellvibrio fulvus and clostridium cellulosolvens at 15 mug/ml, sporocytophaga myxococcoides at 45 mug/ml, and bacillus subtilis at 75 mug/ml. the inhibiting concentrations for tannic acid were found to be 12, 10, 45, and 30 mug/ml, respectively. gallic acid and catechol were much less effective. tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on c. fulvus.  respiration of c. fulvus in the presence of bactericidal concentrations of tannic acid or tannin fraction of carob extract was inhibited less than 30%. a partial formation of "protoplasts" by c. fulvus was obtained after 2 hr of incubation in  a growth medium to which 20% sucrose, 0.15% mgso(4).7h(2)o, and 10 to 50 mug/ml of tannic acid or 500mug/ml of penicillin, or both, had been added. tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract protected c. fulvus from metabolic lysis in sucrose solution. although the growth of other microorganisms tested was only  slightly affected, the morphology of some of them was drastically changed in the  presence of subinhibitory concentrations of carob pod extracts of tannic acid. it is suggested that the site of action of tannins on sensitive microorganisms is primarily the cell envelope.

TI  == quantitative approach to the study of bacterial species.
AB  == liston, j. (university of washington, seattle), w. wiebe, and r. r. colwell. quantitative approach to the study of bacterial species. j. bacteriol. 85:1061-1070. 1963.-the stability of strains of various species of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria was investigated by subculturing each strain through ten different media, testing the substrains so produced through a standard series of  tests, and analyzing the resulting data by electronic computer. strain stability  was shown to be high [similarity coefficient (s) >/= 80%], and some evidence was  obtained for species stability (s >/= 75%). the limits of variability for a species were studied by use of pseudomonas aeruginosa; 33 p. aeruginosa strains (from the american type culture collection) were tested and found to share a high level of similarity. an analysis was made of the distribution of positive characters among the strains, and the group was found to have a mean total of 35  characters (out of a possible 78 which were coded and included in the computer analyses) with a range of 33 to 39 positive characters in individual organisms. the frequency of occurrence of each positive character and the probability of mutual occurrence of pairs of positive characters were calculated. by use of the  quantitative and qualitative data so obtained, a hypothetical median organism for the p. aeruginosa group was derived. the species may then be defined as consisting of all strains which show an s relationship of 75% or more with the median organism. the general applicability of this concept is discussed.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. i. effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  == the effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. the ph range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. availability of oxygen was not a factor. as the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. the repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.

TI  == effect of bromidehypochlorite bactericides on microorganisms.
AB  == a new principle in compounding stable, granular bactericidal products led to unique combinations of a water-soluble inorganic bromide salt with a hypochlorite-type disinfectant of either inorganic or organic type. microbiological results are shown for an inorganic bactericide composed of chlorinated trisodium phosphate containing 3.1% "available chlorine" and 2% potassium bromide, and for an organic bactericide formulated from sodium dichloroisocyanurate so as to contain 13.4% "available chlorine" and 8% potassium bromide. comparison of these products with their nonbromide counterparts are reported for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus lactis, aerobacter aerogenes, and proteus vulgaris. test methods employed were the chambers test, the a.o.a.c. germicidal and detergent sanitizer-official test, and the available chlorine germicidal equivalent concentration test. the minimal killing concentrations for the bromide-hypochlorite bactericides against this variety of organisms were reduced  by a factor 2 to 24 times those required for similar hypochlorite-type disinfectants not containing the bromide.

AB  == gorini, luigi (harvard medical school, boston, mass.). effect of l-cystine on initiation of anaerobic growth of escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes. j. bacteriol. 82:305-312. 1961.-under anaerobic conditions escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes, inoculated in a mineral-citrate-glucose medium at densities up to 10(6) bacteria per ml, exhibit a long lag, or fail to initiate growth at all. growth is initiated rapidly if the medium is supplemented with various sh or ss compounds. of these the most active is l-cystine, which is fully effective at  1 to 2 mum. in a heavily seeded semisolid medium without cystine, turbidity rapidly appears at the aerobic surface and then slowly extends throughout the anaerobic region of the culture. this finding implies that a sufficiently dense anaerobically growing culture creates conditions in the medium which eliminate the requirement for cystine. the nature of this effect on the medium has not been determined, but certain possibilities (ph, pco(2)) have been eliminated. the anaerobic cystine requirement becomes more pronounced in the presence of cu(++),  at concentrations far lower than those required for inhibition under aerobic conditions. while it is possible that cystine is acting by complexing the toxic metal ion, it seems more likely that l-cystine is an essential metabolite, poorly produced under anaerobic conditions, and that the marked toxicity of cu(++) under anaerobic conditions depends on its complexing of cystine.
