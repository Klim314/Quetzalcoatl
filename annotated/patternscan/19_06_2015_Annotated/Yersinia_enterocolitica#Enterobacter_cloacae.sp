TI  == evaluation of a modified cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar for isolation of yersinia spp.
AB  == y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis are important food borne pathogens. however, the presence of competitive microbiota makes the isolation of y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis from naturally contaminated foods difficult. we attempted to evaluate the performance of a modified cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (cin) agar in the differentiation of y. enterocolitica from non-yersinia species, particularly the natural intestinal microbiota. the modified cin enabled the growth of y. enterocolitica colonies with the same efficiency as cin and luria-bertani agar. the detection limits of the modified cin for y. enterocolitica in culture medium (10 cfu/ml) and in artificially contaminated pork (10(4) cfu/ml) were also comparable to those of cin. however, the modified cin provided a better discrimination of yersinia colonies from other bacteria exhibiting yersinia-like colonies on cin (h2s-producing citrobacter freundii, c. braakii, enterobacter cloacae, aeromonas  hydrophila, providencia rettgeri, and morganella morganii). the modified cin exhibited a higher recovery rate of y. enterocolitica from artificially prepared  bacterial cultures and naturally contaminated samples compared with cin. our results thus demonstrated that the use of modified cin may be a valuable means to increase the recovery rate of food borne yersinia from natural samples, which are usually contaminated by multiple types of bacteria.

TI  == diversity and antibiograms of bacterial organisms isolated from samples of household drinking-water consumed by hiv-positive individuals in rural settings,  south africa.
AB  == diarrhoea is a hallmark of hiv infections in developing countries, and many diarrhoea-causing agents are often transmitted through water. the objective of the study was to determine the diversity and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of bacterial organisms isolated from samples of household drinking-water consumed by hiv-infected and aids patients. in the present study, household water stored for use by hiv-positive patients was tested for microbial quality, and isolated bacterial organisms were analyzed for their susceptibility profiles against 25 different antibiotics. the microbial quality of water was generally poor, and about 58% of water samples (n=270) were contaminated with faecal coliforms, with  counts varying from 2 colony-forming unit (cfu)/100 ml to 2.4x10(4) cfu/100 ml. values of total coliform counts ranged from 17 cfu/100 ml to 7.9x10(5)/100 ml. in total, 37 different bacterial species were isolated, and the major isolates included acinetobacter lwoffii (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (7.5%), shigella spp. (14.2%), yersinia enterocolitica (6.7%), and pseudomonas spp. (16.3%). no vibrio  cholerae could be isolated; however, v. fluvialis was isolated from three water samples. the isolated organisms were highly resistant to cefazolin (83.5%), cefoxitin (69.2%), ampicillin (66.4%), and cefuroxime (66.2%). intermediate resistance was observed against gentamicin (10.6%), cefepime (13.4%), ceftriaxone (27.6%), and cefotaxime (29.9%). levofloxacin (0.7%), ceftazidime (2.2%), meropenem (3%), and ciprofloxacin (3.7%) were the most active antibiotics against all the microorganisms, with all recording less than 5% resistance. multiple drug resistance was very common, and 78% of the organisms were resistant to three or more antibiotics. education on treatment of household water is advised for hiv-positive patients, and measures should be taken to improve point-of-use water treatment as immunosuppressed individuals would be more susceptible to opportunistic infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  == using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of listeria, 10 species of vibrio, 2 strains of photobacterium damselae, yersinia enterocolitica 289, bacillus cereus atcc 14529, staphylococcus aureus, atcc 19075 (serotype 104 b), shigella sonnei 20143, klebsiella pneumoniae kp73, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii 200, and escherichia coli. microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the  bacteria investigated down to the species level.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == selectivity and specificity of a chromogenic medium for detecting vibrio parahaemolyticust.
AB  == the thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (tcbs) used in the most-probable-number method for detecting vibrio parahaemolyticus cannot differentiate growth of v. parahaemolyticus from vibrio vulnificus or vibrio mimicus. this study examined the selectivity and specificity of bio-chrome vibrio medium (bcvm), a chromogenic medium that detects v. parahaemolyticus on the basis of the formation of distinct purple colonies on the medium. a panel consisting of 221 strains of bacteria, including 179 vibrio spp. and 42 non-vibrio spp., were examined for their ability to grow and produce colored colonies on bcvm. growth of salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas was inhibited by both bcvm and tcbs. all 148 strains of v. parahaemolyticus grew on bcvm, and 145 of them produced purple colonies. the remaining 31 vibrio spp., except one strain of vibrio fluvialis, were either unable to grow or produced blue-green or white colonies on bcvm. bio-chrome vibrio medium was capable of differentiating v. parahaemolyticus from  other species, including v. vulnificus and v. mimicus. further studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of bcvm for detecting v. parahaemolyticus in foods.

TI  == accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  == a microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were printed on a brain heart infusion (bhi) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. this approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == a novel integrative and conjugative element (ice) of escherichia coli: the putative progenitor of the yersinia high-pathogenicity island.
AB  == diversification of bacterial species and pathotypes is largely caused by horizontal transfer of diverse dna elements such as plasmids, phages and genomic  islands (e.g. pathogenicity islands, pais). a pai called high-pathogenicity island (hpi) carrying genes involved in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition (yersiniabactin system) has previously been identified in yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica ib strains, and has been characterized as an essential virulence factor in these species. strikingly, an orthologous hpi is a widely distributed virulence determinant among escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae which cause extraintestinal infections. here we report on the  hpi of e. coli strain ecor31 which is distinct from all other hpis described to date because the ecor31 hpi comprises an additional 35 kb fragment at the right border compared to the hpi of other e. coli and yersinia species. this part encodes for both a functional mating pair formation system and a dna-processing region related to plasmid clodf13 of enterobacter cloacae. upon induction of the  p4-like integrase, the entire hpi of ecor31 is precisely excised and circularised. the hpi of ecor31 presented here resembles integrative and conjugative elements termed ice. it may represent the progenitor of the hpi found in y. pestis and e. coli, revealing a missing link in the horizontal transfer of  an element that contributes to microbial pathogenicity upon acquisition.

TI  == development of a brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and pcr which distinguishes b. suis from brucella abortus.
AB  == a genomic library was prepared from brucella suis dna (mboi digested) and cloned  into the bamhi site of puc18. colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified b. suis dna labelled with alpha 32p was carried out to identify colonies of interest. about 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole b. suis genomic dna as a probe, were selected. because of the high degree of dna homology between b. suis and brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. of seven fragments selected to probe whole b. suis, b. abortus, and yersinia enterocolitica dna, one was found to hybridise with b. suis only. the probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. after optimisation of the pcr, a product of 420bp was obtained with b. suis template dna and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with b. abortus template dna. this is the first reported pcr of the brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between b. suis and b. abortus. no band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify e. coli,  y. enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, corynebacterium bovis, or serratia marcescens template dna.

TI  == multiplex pcr for detection of enterobacteriaceae in blood.
AB  == background: rapid and sensitive methods are needed to detect the small numbers of bacteria that may sometimes contaminate units of blood during collection. a multiplex 5'-nuclease taqman pcr assay (pe applied biosystems) was used to detect several bacterial species that may contaminate blood. study design and methods: oligonucleotide primers were made for regions of the 16s rrna gene conserved in four different bacterial species: yersinia enterocolitica and serratia, klebsiella, and enterobacter species. two probes were designed: sl-1 detected serratia, klebsiella, and enterobacter species, and ye-3 detected y. enterocolitica. results: when taqman pcr was performed with chromosomal dna isolated from pure cultures of serratia liquefaciens, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter agglomerans, the limit of detection with probe sl-1 was 1 to 2 cfus. for s. marcescens, the sensitivity was 8 cfus. the limit of detection for y. enterocolitica with probe ye-3 was 2 cfus. when total chromosomal dna was extracted from whole-blood samples spiked with different numbers of y. enterocolitica, s. liquefaciens, e. cloacae, or k. pneumoniae bacteria, the taqman pcr detected 12 to 16 organisms in 1 ml of blood. conclusion: the 5'-nuclease taqman pcr assay takes only 3 hours to perform and has the potential to detect very small numbers of bacteria.

TI  == ibc-1, a novel integron-associated class a beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum  properties produced by an enterobacter cloacae clinical strain.
AB  == a transferable beta-lactamase produced by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate  of enterobacter cloacae was studied. the bla gene was carried by a large (>80-kb) transmissible plasmid. nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments revealed  that it was part of a gene cassette carried by a class 1 integron along with other resistance genes, including aac(6')-ib. the encoded beta-lactamase, designated ibc-1, was a novel class a enzyme that hydrolyzed ceftazidime and cefotaxime and was inhibited by tazobactam and, to a lesser extent, by clavulanate. also, imipenem exhibited potent inhibitory activity against ibc-1. the enzyme consisted of 287 amino acid residues, including ser-237, cysteines at  positions 69 and 237a, and arg-244, which may be implicated in its interaction with beta-lactams. in amino acid sequence comparisons, ibc-1 displayed the highest similarity with the chromosomal penicillinase of yersinia enterocolitica, a carbenicillinase from proteus mirabilis gn79, the species-specific beta-lactamases of klebsiella oxytoca, and the carbapenemase sme-1. however, a phylogenetic association with established beta-lactamase clusters could not be conclusively shown.

TI  == cloning, sequence analyses, expression, and distribution of ampc-ampr from morganella morganii clinical isolates.
AB  == shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the  pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the  mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase  expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the  organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.

TI  == identification of bacterial isolates obtained from intestinal contents associated with 12,000-year-old mastodon remains.
AB  == mastodon (mammut americanum) remains unearthed during excavation of ancient sediments usually consist only of skeletal material, due to postmortem decomposition of soft tissues by microorganisms. two recent excavations of skeletal remains in anoxic sediments in ohio and michigan, however, have uncovered organic masses which appear to be remnants of the small and large intestines, respectively. macrobotanical examinations of the composition of these masses revealed assemblages of plant material radiocarbon dated to approximately  11,500 years before the present and thought to be incompletely digested food remains from this extinct mammal. we attempted to cultivate and identify bacteria from the intestinal contents, bone-associated sediments, and sediments not in proximity to the remains using a variety of general and selective media. in all,  295 isolates were cultivated, and 38 individual taxa were identified by fatty acid-methyl ester (fame) profiles and biochemical characteristics (api-20e). the  taxonomic positions of selected enteric and obligately anaerobic bacteria were confirmed by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequencing. results indicate that the intestinal and bone-associated samples contained the greatest diversity of bacterial taxa and that members of the family enterobacteriaceae represented 41%  of all isolates and were predominant in the intestinal masses and sediments in proximity to the skeleton but were uncommon in the background sediments. enterobacter cloacae was the most commonly identified isolate, and partial rdna sequencing revealed that rahnella aquatilis was the correct identity of strains suggested by fame profiles to be yersinia enterocolitica. no bacteroides spp. or  expected intestinal anaerobes were recovered. the only obligate anaerobes recovered were clostridia, and these were not recovered from the small intestinal masses. microbiological evidence from this study supports other, macrobotanical data indicating the intestinal origin of these masses. whether these organisms are direct descendants of the original intestinal microbiota, however, cannot be  established.

TI  == dna shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  == dna shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. an alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. to evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. a single cycle  of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. the best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. the power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the ampc beta-lactamase of morganella morganii.
AB  == the chromosomal beta-lactamase gene of a clinical isolate of morganella morganii  was cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. the beta-lactamase had a pi of 7.4  and conferred a typical ampc susceptibility pattern. the insert obtained was found to encode a protein of 379 amino acids. its deduced amino acid sequence revealed it to be a class c beta-lactamase: 39-56% identity with chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases of serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli; and 37-56% identity with plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (mox-1, cmy-1, fox-1, act-1, lat-1, bil-1 and cmy-2). the ampc gene was linked to a gene only part of which (450 bp) was cloned homologous to the regulatory ampr genes of chromosomal class c beta-lactamases.

TI  == a simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  == the muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc). though sensitive, the hplc procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. we have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (face) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid,  after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to uv light. face detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and yersinia enterocolitica.  as little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic hplc technique. thus, face may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by hplc, or face may eventually replace hplc for some applications.

AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == characterization of an lysr family protein, smer from serratia marcescens s6, its effect on expression of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase sme-1, and comparison of this regulator with other beta-lactamase regulators.
AB  == serratia marcescens s6 produces a chromosomally encoded carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, sme-1 (t. naas, l. vandel, w. sougakoff, d. m. livermore, and p. nordmann, antimicrob. agents chemother. 38:1262-1270, 1994). upstream from smea we identified a second open reading frame (embl accession number z30237). this encodes a 33.1-kda protein, smer, which has a high degree of homology with nmcr, the lysr regulatory protein of the only other sequenced carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, nmca from enterobacter cloacae nor-1. it is weakly related to ampr of the chromosomal cephalosporinase regulatory systems described in e. cloacae, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter  freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and is very weakly related to other lysr-type regulators of class a beta-lactamases. smer is a weakly positive regulator for sme-1 expression in the absence of or in the presence of beta-lactam inducers. the -35 and -10 regions of smer are in the opposite orientations and are face-to-face relative to the smea promoter. smer acts similarly to nmcr and not as the ampr regulators described for class c beta-lactamase systems. smer is a weak inducer in the absence or presence of beta-lactams. as was found for the ampc-ampr and nmca-nmcr systems, a putative smer-binding site was present upstream from the beta-lactamase gene promoter regions. beta-galactosidase activity from a smer-lacz translational fusion was expressed constitutively and decreased in the presence of smer from a coresident  plasmid, suggesting that smer is autogeneously controlled. finally, beta-lactams  did not affect the expression of smer, which is the second regulator of a class a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase to be identified.

TI  == identification and characterization of an outer membrane protein, ompx, in escherichia coli that is homologous to a family of outer membrane proteins including ail of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == we previously reported that a region of the escherichia coli chromosome at 18 min increased e sigma e activity when cloned in multicopy (j. mecsas, p. e. rouviere, j. w. erickson, t. j. donohue, and c. a. gross, genes dev. 7:2618-2628, 1993). in the present report, we identify and characterize the gene responsible for the increase in e sigma e activity. this gene is in a monocistronic operon with two promoters and a rho-independent terminator. sequence analysis of this gene indicated that it encodes an outer membrane protein which is 83% identical to ompx in enterobacter cloacae, leading us to name this gene ompx. there are four other proteins that are homologous to ompx. several of these proteins, ail of yersinia enterocolitica and rck and pagc of salmonella typhimurium, have properties that allow bacteria to adhere to mammalian cells, survive exposure to  human serum, and/or survive within macrophages. we therefore characterized strains deleted for ompx for their growth phenotypes, e sigma e activity, serum resistance, and adherence to mammalian cells. no differences in growth rates, serum resistance, or adherence to mammalian cells were observed; however, e sigma e activity was dependent on expression of ompx in certain strain backgrounds.

TI  == invasion of rabbit ileal tissue by enterobacter cloacae varies with the concentration of ompx in the outer membrane.
AB  == the outer membrane protein ompx of enterobacter cloacae shows high amino acid homology with virulence proteins pagc and rck from salmonella typhimurium and with ail from yersinia enterocolitica. here we demonstrate a role for ompx in the invasion of rabbit ileal tissue by e. cloacae. an organ culture system was used for maintenance of rabbit gut tissue during the experiments. the invasiveness of  three e. cloacae strains, which differed in ompx content, were compared with each other and with that of salmonella typhimurium tml (a highly invasive strain) and  s. typhimurium lt7 (a noninvasive strain). there was no significant difference between the invasiveness of the wild type and that of an ompx deletion mutant strain of e. cloacae; they were equally as invasive or less invasive than s. typhimurium lt7. the invasiveness of an ompx overproducer strain of e. cloacae was 10-fold higher than that of its immediate parent carrying only the multicopy  plasmid, higher than that of s. typhimurium lt7, but lower than that of s. typhimurium tml. the invasiveness of e. cloacae thus varied directly with the level of ompx in the outer membrane in rabbit ileal enterocytes challenged in situ.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == amino acid substitutions in naturally occurring variants of ail result in altered invasion activity.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is the causative agent of a variety of gastrointestinal syndromes ranging from acute enteritis to mesenteric lymphadenitis. in addition,  systemic infections resulting in high mortality rates can occur in elderly and immunocompromised patients. more than 50 serotypes of y. enterocolitica have been identified, but only a few of them commonly cause disease in otherwise healthy hosts. those serotypes that cause disease have been divided into two groups, american and non-american, based on their geographical distributions, biotypes, and pathogenicity. we have been studying two genes, inv and ail, from y. enterocolitica that confer in tissue culture assays an invasive phenotype that strongly correlates with virulence. some differences between the american and non-american serotypes at the ail locus were noted previously and have been investigated further in this report. the ail locus was cloned from seven y. enterocolitica strains (seven different serotypes). although the different clones produced similar amounts of ail, the product of the ail gene from non-american serotypes (ailna) was less able to promote invasion by escherichia coli than was  the product of the ail gene from american serotypes (aila). this difference is probably due to one or more of the eight amino acid changes found in the derived  amino acid sequence for the mature form of ailna compared with that of aila. seven of these changes are predicted to be in cell surface domains of the protein (a model for the proposed folding of ail within the outer membrane is presented). these results are discussed in relation to the growing family of outer membrane proteins, which includes lom from bacteriophage lambda, pagc from salmonella typhimurium, and ompx from enterobacter cloacae.

AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == role of ph, lactate, and anaerobiosis in controlling the growth of some fermentative gram-negative bacteria on beef.
AB  == at 5 degrees c four strains of fermentative, gram-negative bacteria (serratia liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and aeromonas hydrophila) grew aerobically and anaerobically on adipose tissue removed from beef muscle of low ph (5.4 to 5.6). all four strains also grew aerobically and anaerobically on muscle tissue of high ph (6.0 to 6.3). however, none of the four grew anaerobically on beef muscle of low ph, and the aeromonad strain also failed to grow aerobically on such muscle. growth of s. liquefaciens and e.cloacae on vacuum-packaged beef muscle was dependent on the ph of the tissue and the oxygen  transmission rate of the packaging film. although the four strains grew in broth  buffered at ph 5.55, l-lactate, at the concentration found in muscle of low ph (ca. 100 mm), prevented anaerobic growth of all four isolates and prevented the aerobic growth of th aeromonad. at ph 6.1 in buffered broth, the concentration of l-lactate occurring in muscle of high ph did not prevent aerobic or anaerobic growth of any of the strains.

TI  == enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and yersinia enterocolitica in colonies of laboratory mice, rats and rabbits: an attempt of isolation.
AB  == an attempt to isolate enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and yersinia enterocolitica was made in a total of 931 laboratory animals (mice, rats and rabbits) from five representative commercial breeders in this country and from our laboratory colonies. e. cloacae organisms were isolated from feces and other  specimens of 15 mice and 17 rats between november 1979 and july 1980. neither s.  marcescens nor y. enterocolitica was detectable in any specimen of feces, fur and skin, nasal discharge, lungs, urinary bladder or urine from the animals examined.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.

TI  == enterobacteria of emerging pathogenic significance from clinical cases in man and animals and detection of toads and wall lizards as their reservoirs.
AB  == a total of 416 samples comprising faecal samples from diarrhoeic cases of man, calves, sheep and goats, and urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections, were examined for the presence of enterobacteria of emerging pathogenic significance. citrobacter freundii from 20, c. intermedius biotype-a from four, serratia marcescens (serotype 05:h13, bactericin type 16) from one and erwinia herbicola from two human stool samples were isolated. only two urine samples yielded c. freundii. citrobacter freundii was isolated from 10 and c. intermedius biotype-a from two calves. from sheep and goats, two isolates of c. freundii and three of c. intermedius biotype-a were obtained. none of these samples yielded edwarsiella tarda or yersinia enterocolitica. the examination of  99 toads and 145 wall lizards revealed that toads were reservoirs for c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a and salmonella brijbhumi, whereas wall lizards were reservoirs for c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a, e. herbicola, enterobacter cloacae and salmonella spp. these bacteria were present in the range of 2.0 x 10(6) to 6.0 x 10(11) organisms per gram of intestinal contents. in addition, toads were carriers for edwardsiella tarda (new serotypes 04167:h1 and  05159: non-motile). none of the toads and wall lizards proved positive for c. intermedius biotype-b (c. koseri), s. marcescens and y. entercolitica. c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a, e. herbicola and s. marcescens were resistant to penicillin and erythromycin whereas e. tarda isolates were also resistant to gentamycin, neomycin, colistin and sulfamethaxazole.
