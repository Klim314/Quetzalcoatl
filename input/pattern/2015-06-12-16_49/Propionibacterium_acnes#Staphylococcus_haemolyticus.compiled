TI  - 5alpha-Androst-16-en-3alpha-ol beta-D-glucuronide, precursor of 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol in human sweat.
AB  - 5alpha-Androst-16-en-3alpha-ol (alpha-androstenol) is an important contributor to human axilla sweat odor. It is assumed that alpha-andostenol is excreted from the apocrine glands via a H2 O-soluble conjugate, and this precursor was formally characterized in this study for the first time in human sweat. The possible H2 O-soluble precursors, sulfate and glucuronide derivatives, were synthesized as analytical standards, i.e., alpha-androstenol, beta-androstenol sulfates, 5alpha-androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol (beta-androstadienol) sulfate, alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide, alpha-androstenol alpha-glucuronide, beta-androstadienol beta-glucuronide, and alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide furanose. The occurrence of alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide was established by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS (heated electrospray ionization (HESI)) in negative-ion mode in pooled human sweat, containing eccrine and apocrine secretions and collected from 25 female and 24 male underarms. Its concentration was of 79 ng/ml in female secretions and 241 ng/ml in male secretions. The release of alpha-androstenol was observed after incubation of the sterile human sweat or alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide with a commercial glucuronidase enzyme, the urine-isolated bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae, and the skin bacteria Staphylococcus warneri DSM 20316, Staphylococcus haemolyticus DSM 20263, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919, reported to have beta-glucuronidase activities. We demonstrated that if alpha- and beta-androstenols and androstadienol sulfates were present in human sweat, their concentrations would be too low to be considered as potential precursors of malodors; therefore, the H2 O-soluble precursor of alpha-androstenol in apocrine secretion should be a beta-glucuronide.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Mediastinitis after cardiac surgery: improvement of bacteriological diagnosis by  use of multiple tissue samples and strain typing.
AB  - The diagnosis of postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) among patients with sternal wound complication (SWC) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and chest pain can be caused by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. The definitions of PSM usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a microbiological criterion for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone. Patients reexplored due to SWC after cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement (HVR) with or without CABG performed at the Department for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at the Uppsala University Hospital between 10 March 1998 and 9 September 2000 were investigated prospectively. Tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. Culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. Species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were included in the study group. Of these patients, 32 were infected according to the microbiological criterion (i.e., the same strain was found in >/=50% of the samples). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38% of the cases (12/32), S. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31% (10/32), P. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25% (8/32), and S. simulans and S. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3% (1/32) each. All cases of S. aureus infection and 86% (12/14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) infections were identified from primary cultures. All cases fulfilling the microbiological criterion for S. aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological diagnosis of CoNS infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. Among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67% (12/18) had a CoNS infection, compared to 14% (2/14) of those without sternal dehiscence. The difference was statistically significant. PSM caused by S. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30% of cases with CoNS infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. Multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. The role of P. acnes as a possible cause of PSM needs further investigation. PSM caused by CoNS is significantly related to sternal dehiscence.
TI  - Peripheral teflon catheters. Potential source for bacterial contamination of orthopedic implants?
AB  - To detect low numbers of bacterial cells on Teflon catheters removed from peripheral veins, 74 catheter tips were incubated in thioglycollate media for up to ten days. Fifteen (20.3%) of the catheters were found to be culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from seven, Staphylococcus epidermidis from six, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis from one each, all common skin organisms associated with infection of implants. An increase in documentation of bacterial contamination resulted from incubating greater than 72 hours; this allowed the slower-replicating Propionibacterium acnes to grow to detectable numbers. Because of these findings and those of others, attention is focused on the peripheral vein conduit as a potential source for hematogenous seeding of implants with bacterial cells. Changing peripheral catheters within 24 hours is recommended to reduce the constant risk of occult bacteremia.
