antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion on cariogenic planktonic and biofilm organisms.
introduction: nanoemulsions (ne) are a unique class of disinfectants produced by  mixing a water immiscible liquid phase into an aqueous phase under high shear forces. ne have antimicrobial properties and are also effective anti-biofilm agents. materials and methods: the effectiveness of nanoemulsion and its components was determined against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei by live/dead staining. in vitro antimicrobial effectiveness of nanoemulsion against planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, actinomyces viscosus, candida albicans and mixed culture was determined by a serial dilution technique to obtain minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). in addition, efficacy was investigated by kinetics of killing, adherence and biofilm assays. results: compared to its components, nanoemulsion showed notable antimicrobial activity against biofilm organisms, up to 83.0% kill within 1min. ne dilutions ranging from 243 to 19683 were effective against planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed culture of these four strains as shown through mic/mbc assays. ne showed antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells at high dilutions, confirmed by time kill studies. the level of adhesion on glass surface was reduced by 94.2-99.5% in nanoemulsion treated groups (p<0.001). 4-day-old s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed cultures biofilms treated with ne showed reductions of bacterial counts with decreasing dilutions (p<0.001). conclusion: these results suggest that nanoemulsion has effective anti-cariogenic activity against cariogenic microorganisms and may be a useful medication in the prevention of caries.
antibacterial activity of a triclosan-containing resin composite matrix against three common oral bacteria.
this study investigated the antibacterial effect of a resin composite matrix with or without incorporated triclosan (0.3 wt%) on streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus casei. in the quantitative assay, bacterial suspensions were filled into 20-mul cavities within temporary restorative resins. after 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h of incubation, the suspensions were removed from the restoratives and the numbers of viable bacteria were determined. bacterial suspensions incubated without restoratives served as the controls. ten replicates were carried out for each experiment. the resin composite containing triclosan demonstrated variable degrees of antibacterial activity against the microorganisms, revealing a significant inhibitory effect on s. mutans within 12 h compared to the control. the viable counts of a. viscosus significantly decreased after 24 h. a significant reduction of l. casei was observed after 48 h. the unloaded resin composite did not reveal a marked antibacterial effect. the resin composite loaded with triclosan might be beneficial in preventing cavity contamination and minimizing the risk of pulpal irritation in the short-term.
effects of er:yag laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
with the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use er:yag lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. we examined their effects against biofilms made of actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, or prevotella nigrescens in vitro. after er:yag laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 j/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. the er:yag laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by l. casei. after irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. er: yag lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
potentiation of the bactericidal activity of harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) leaf extract against oral bacteria using poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles: in vitro study.
harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) is known to have biological properties with mainly antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the ethyl acetate h. madagascariensis leaf extract (hle) on the main oral bacterial strains largely implicated in dental caries and gingivitis infections, and the possibility of potentialization of hle antibacterial effects using the poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (plg-np). the microdilution technique and the interfacial polymer deposition following the solvent diffusion method were used to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of ethyl acetate hle and to prepare nanoparticles, respectively. hle showed significant bactericidal effects against the bacterial strains tested, with minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to 5 x 10(2) mg/l or less, except for lactobacillus casei with 7.5 x 10(2) mg/l. with the hle incorporated into plg nanoparticles (hle-plg-np), we observed diminution of the bactericidal concentration compared to hle, the upper mbc being of 1.875 x 10(2) mg/l. incorporation of the hle into a colloidal carrier optimized its antibacterial performance.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on cariogenic bacteria.
the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces naeslundii. whereas the growth of s. mutans was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after 24 h of exposure. similar effects were observed with a. naeslundii and l. casei. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also markedly affected by nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 7, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of s. mutans, with similar effects on the other organisms tested. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva has an effect on the growth and survival of cariogenic bacteria.
incorporation of antibacterial monomer mdpb into dentin primer.
the polymerizable monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) shows antibacterial activity when immobilized in a resin-based material. in this study, the antibacterial effect of a dentin primer incorporating mdpb was investigated. the influence of incorporation of mdpb on bond strength to dentin and on the curing performance of the adhesive system was also evaluated. experimental primers were prepared by addition of mdpb into a proprietary primer at 1, 2, or 5%. antibacterial effects of experimental primers were compared with those of control primer and two other proprietary primers by an agar disc-diffusion method and bactericidal activity test. experimental primers produced greater inhibition zones against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei than any of three proprietary primers, and inhibition increased as the concentration of mdpb was increased. bactericidal activity of mdpb-containing primers against streptococcus mutans was greater than those of the other three primers, with incorporation of mdpb at 5% showing complete killing of bacteria after 30 s contact. no decrease in tensile bond strength was observed for materials containing mdpb. on the contrary, the primer incorporating 1 and 2% mdpb showed higher bond strength than all the others, including the control (p < 0.05). when the degree of conversion of the complex of primer and adhesive resin was determined with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, there were no significant differences between any of the experimental primers and the control (p > 0.05). these results indicate that incorporation of the antibacterial monomer mdpb enhanced the antibacterial effect of a proprietary dentin primer before curing, and had no adverse influence on bond strength to dentin and curing of the adhesive system.
