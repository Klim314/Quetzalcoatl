TI  - Cloning and Characterization of an Enantioselective l-Menthyl Benzoate Hydrolase  from Acinetobacter sp. ECU2040.
AB  - A new esterase gene abmbh, encoding a benzoate hydrolase which can enantioselectively hydrolyze l-menthyl benzoate to l-menthol, was recently identified from the genomic library of a soil isolate Acinetobacter sp. ECU2040. The abmbh gene contains a 1080-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 360 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kDa. The corresponding enzyme AbMBH was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), purified, and characterized. The AbMBH displayed the maximum activity towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate at 50 degrees C, and an optimum pH of 8.5. A K M of 2.6 mM and a k cat of 0.26 s-1 were observed towards dl-menthyl benzoate. The AbMBH exhibited a moderate enantioselectivity (E = 27.5) towards dl-menthyl benzoate. It can also catalyze the enantioselective hydrolysis of a variety of racemic menthyl esters, including dl-menthyl acetate, dl-menthyl chloroacetate, and dl-menthyl butyrate.
TI  - Unravelling the genome of long chain N-acylhomoserine lactone-producing Acinetobacter sp. strain GG2 and identification of its quorum sensing synthase gene.
AB  - Myriad proteobacteria use N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules as quorum sensing (QS) signals to regulate different physiological functions, including virulence, antibiotic production, and biofilm formation. Many of these proteobacteria possess LuxI/LuxR system as the QS mechanism. Recently, we reported the 3.89 Mb genome of Acinetobacter sp. strain GG2. In this work, the genome of this long chain AHL-producing bacterium was unravelled which led to the molecular characterization of luxI homologue, designated as aciI. This 552 bp gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The purified protein was approximately 20.5 kDa and is highly similar to several autoinducer proteins of LuxI family among Acinetobacter species. To verify the AHL synthesis activity of this protein, high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed the production of 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone and 3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone from induced E. coli harboring the recombinant AciI. Our data show for the first time, the cloning and characterization of the luxI homologue from Acinetobacter sp. strain GG2, and confirmation of its AHLs production. These data are of great significance as the annotated genome of strain GG2 has provided a valuable insight in the study of autoinducer molecules and its roles in QS mechanism of the bacterium.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a University hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in State University of Campinas, no data has been published yet. METHODS: The main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. The blood culture records requested from 4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The samples were processed using the Bact/Alert(R) system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). There were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). The prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (15.87%), Escherichia coli (13.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), Enterobacter sp (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and Candida sp (5.1%). Examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 80% of the CNS isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For A. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for P. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When all Gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. For empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.
TI  - Versatile plasmid-based expression systems for Gram-negative bacteria-General essentials exemplified with the bacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16.
AB  - The Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli is currently the most efficient and  widely used prokaryotic host for recombinant protein and metabolite production. However, due to some limitations and to various interesting features of other Gram-negative bacteria efficient vector systems applicable to a broad range are desired. Basic building blocks for plasmid-based vectors include besides the need for a suitable selection marker in the first line a proper replication and maintenance system. In addition to these basic requirements, further elements are needed for Gram-negative bacteria beyond E. coli, such as Pseudomonas pudita, Ralstonia eutropha, Burkholderia glumae or Acinetobacter sp.. Established building blocks have to be adapted and new building blocks providing the desired functions need to be identified and exploited. This minireview addresses so far described and used genetic elements for broad host range replication, efficient plasmid maintenance, and conjugative plasmid transfer as well as expression elements and protein secretion signals. The industrially important bacterium R. eutropha H16 was chosen as a model organism to provide specific data on the effectivity and utility of building blocks based on such genetic elements.
TI  - Biodegradation of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl (FE) by Acinetobacter sp. strain DL-2 and cloning of FE hydrolase gene afeH.
AB  - Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl (FE) is widely used as a post-emergence aryloxyphenoxy propionate (AOPP) herbicide in agriculture. An efficient FE-degrading strain DL-2 was isolated from the enrichment culture and identified as Acinetobacter sp. and the metabolite fenoxaprop acid (FA) was identified by HPLC/MS analysis. The strain DL-2 could also degrade a wide range of other AOPP herbicides. A novel FE hydrolase esterase gene afeH was cloned from strain DL-2 and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The specific activities of recombinant AfeH was 216.39Umg(-1) for FE with Km and Vmax values of 0.82muM and 7.94mumolmin(-1)mg(-1). AfeH could also hydrolyze various AOPP herbicides, p-nitrophenyl esters and triglycerides. The optimal pH and temperature for recombinant AfeH were 9.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively; the enzyme was activated by Co(2+) and inhibited by Ca(2+), Zn(2+), Ba(2+). AfeH was inhibited strongly by phenylmethylsulfonyl and SDS and weakly by dimethyl sulfoxide.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.
AB  - Prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), E. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and S. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the Mooi River, North West province, South Africa.
AB  - Groundwater in the Mooi River catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. In this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. Physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. HPC bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. E. coli were enumerated from Trimpark, School and Cemetery. The Blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. Pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. Opportunistic pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium spp. Varying patterns of antibiotic resistance were observed. Most HPC bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. Pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant ARB. Other ARBs included Alcaligenes faecalis, Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. ARBs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to HPCs. The presence of E. coli and ARB in these groundwater sources indicates potential human health risks. These risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.
TI  - Crystal structure of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase from a Gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 A resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  - Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) catalyses the release of tRNA and peptide components from peptidyl-tRNA molecules. Pth from a Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (SpPth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised. Three-dimensional structure of SpPth was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.19 A resolution. Structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated A and B. The superimposition of C(alpha) traces of molecules A and B showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 A, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. The polypeptide chain of SpPth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. The substrate-binding cleft in SpPth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, Ile91-Leu102; the base loop, Gly108-Gly115; and the lid loop, Gly136-Gly150. Unlike in the structures of Pth from Gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of SpPth appeared to be virtually closed. However, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.
TI  - Antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp.  LG41.
AB  - Two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols A and B (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins A and B (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2S)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp. LG41, harbored in the roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Xanthium sibiricum. Their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (NMR and HRMS(n)), and their absolute configurations were deduced by ECD calculations or optical rotation data. Since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. (2S)-Butylitaconic acid (5) and (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against Acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. Compound 2 was highly active against the clinically relevant S. aureus. By comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at C-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. Our study reveals plausible ecological roles of the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Penialidins A-C with strong antibacterial activities from Penicillium sp., an endophytic fungus harboring leaves of Garcinia nobilis.
AB  - Three new polyketides named penialidins A-C (1-3), along with one known compound, citromycetin (4), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Penicillium sp., harbored in the leaves of the Cameroonian medicinal plant Garcinia nobilis. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods (NMR and HRMS(n)). The antibacterial efficacies of the new compounds (1-3) were tested against the clinically-important risk group 2 (RG2) bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The ecologically imposing strains of E. coli (RG1), Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4 were also included in the assay. Compound 3 exhibited pronounced activity against the clinically-relevant S. aureus as well as against B. subtilis comparable to that of the reference standard (streptomycin). Compound 2 was also highly-active against S. aureus. By comparing the structures of the three new compounds (1-3), it was revealed that altering the substitutions at C-10 and C-2 can significantly increase the antibacterial activity of 1.
TI  - Expression, purification and reconstitution of the 4-hydroxybenzoate transporter  PcaK from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1.
AB  - The aromatic acid:H(+) symporter family of integral membrane proteins play an important role in the microbial metabolism of aromatic compounds. Here, we show that the 4-hydroxybenzoate transporter from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, PcaK, can be successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Affinity-purified PcaK is a stable, monodisperse homotrimer in the detergent n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltopyranoside supplemented with cholesteryl hemisuccinate. The purified protein has alpha-helical secondary structure and can be reconstituted to a functional state in synthetic proteoliposomes. Asymmetric substrate transport was observed when proteoliposomes were energized by applying an electrochemical proton gradient (DeltamuH(+)) or a membrane potential (DeltaPsi) but not by DeltapH alone. PcaK was selective in transporting 4-hydroxybenzoate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate over closely related compounds, confirming previous reports on substrate specificity. However, PcaK also showed an unexpected preference for transporting 2-hydroxybenzoates. These results provide the basis for further detailed studies of the structure and function of this family of transporters.
TI  - Engineering an Acinetobacter regulon for biosensing and high-throughput enzyme screening in E. coli via flow cytometry.
AB  - We created a single cell sorting system to screen for enzyme activity in Escherichia coli producing 3,4 dihydroxy benzoate (34DHB). To do so, we engineered a transcription factor regulon controlling the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) for induction by 34DHB. An autoregulated transcription factor, pcaU, was borrowed from Acinetobacter sp ADP1 to E. coli and its promoter region adapted for activity in E. Coli. The engineered pcaU regulon was inducible at >5 muM exogenous 34DHB, making it a sensitive biosensor for this industrially significant nylon precursor. Addition of a second plasmid provided IPTG inducible expression of dehydroshikimate dehydratase enzyme (AsbF), which converts endogenous dehydroshikimate to 34DHB. This system produced GFP fluorescence in an IPTG dose-dependent manner, and was easily detected in single cell on flow cytometer despite a moderate catalytic efficiency of AsbF. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), individual cells carrying the active AsbF could be isolated even when diluted into a decoy population of cells carrying a mutant (inactivated) AsbF variant at one part in a million. The same biosensor was also effective for further optimization of itself. FACS on E. coli carrying randomized loci in the promoter showed several variants with enhanced response to 34DHB.
TI  - X-ray structure of a novel L-ribose isomerase acting on a non-natural sugar L-ribose as its ideal substrate.
AB  - l-Ribose, a pentose, is not known to exist in nature. Although organisms typically do not have a metabolic pathway that uses l-ribose as a carbon source, prokaryotes use various sugars as carbon sources for survival. Acinetobacter sp. DL-28 has been shown to express the novel enzyme, l-ribose isomerase (AcL-RbI), which catalyzes reversible isomerization between l-ribose and l-ribulose. AcL-RbI showed the highest activity to l-ribose, followed by d-lyxose with 47% activity, and had no significant amino acid sequence similarity to structure-known proteins, except for weak homology with the d-lyxose isomerases from Escherichia coli O157 : H7 (18%) and Bacillus subtilis strain (19%). Thus, AcL-RbI is expected to have the unique three-dimensional structure to recognize l-ribose as its ideal substrate. The X-ray structures of AcL-RbI in complexes with substrates were determined. AcL-RbI had a cupin-type beta-barrel structure, and the catalytic site was found between two large beta-sheets with a bound metal ion. The catalytic site structures clearly showed that AcL-RbI adopted a cis-enediol intermediate mechanism for the isomerization reaction using two glutamate residues (Glu113 and Glu204) as acid/base catalysts. In its crystal form, AcL-RbI formed a unique homotetramer with many substrate sub-binding sites, which likely facilitated capture of the substrate. DATABASE: The atomic coordinates and structure factors of AcL-RbI/l-ribose, AcL-RbI/l-ribulose, AcL-RbI/ribitol, E204Q/l-ribose and E204Q/l-ribulose have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes, 4Q0P, 4Q0Q, 4Q0S, 4Q0U and 4Q0V.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections: preventable cause of mortality in spinal cord injury patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an alarming rate of morbidity and mortality observed in the  trauma victims who suffer spinal cord injuries (SCI). Such patients are admitted immediately and stay for longer periods of time and thus are at risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. AIMS: The aim of this study is to analyze the primary cause of mortality in SCI patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 4 year analysis of the postmortem data of 341 patients who died after sustaining SCI at a tertiary care apex trauma center of India. Epidemiological data of patients including the type of trauma, duration of hospital stay, cause of death and microbiological data were recorded. RESULTS: On autopsy, out of 341 patients, the main cause of death in the SCI patients was ascertained to be infection/septicemia in 180 (52.7%) patients, the rest 161 (47.2%) died due to severe primary injury. Respiratory tract infections (36.4%) were predominant followed by urinary tract infections (32.2%), blood stream infections (22.2%), wound infections (7.1%) and meningitis reported in only 5 (2.1%) cases. Acinetobacter sp (40%) was the predominant organism isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp (16.3%), Klebsiella sp (15.1%), Candida sp (7.8%), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.9%), Proteus sp (3.3%), Enterobacter sp and Burkholderia sp (two cases each) and Stenotrophomonas sp (one case). A high level of multidrug resistance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are leading cause of loss of young lives in trauma patients; hence efforts should be made to prevent HAIs.
TI  - Are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in Brooklyn, NY. As a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. Screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR method. RESULTS: Of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. Cephalosporin-resistant Citrobacter freundii (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 2), and Enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not from control sites. One isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated VIM-2. Acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6 miles (P = .004). Eleven A baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR and were also related to a known clinical isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of A baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. Finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. The finding of integron-associated VIM-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further vigilance is warranted.
TI  - Chemical composition, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oil from the flowers of Tunisian Convolvulus althaeoides L.
AB  - This study describes the chemical composition and evaluates the antibacterial and the cytotoxic effects of the essential oil from the flowers of Convolvulus althaeoides. Its chemical composition, determined by GC and GC-MS, is reported for the first time. A total of 24 compounds, accounting for 95.5% of the total oil, have been identified. The oil was characterised by a high proportion of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (36.3%), followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (34.7%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (24.5%). The main compounds were germacrene D (12.5%), T-cadinol (11.8%) and verbenone (6.9%). The essential oil was tested for its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and the clinical strain Acinetobacter sp. as well as facts cytotoxic activity towards the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. This oil did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria; however, it exerted a significant cytotoxic activity against the tested cell line (IC(5)(0) = 8.16 mug/mL).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against Gram-negative organisms collected from U.S. medical centers in 2012.
AB  - The activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli. Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits Ambler class A, C, and some D enzymes. A total of 10,928 Gram-negative bacilli-8,640 Enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 Acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 U.S. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA, USA). Ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. Overall, 99.8% of Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC>/=2 mug/ml) K. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae. Among ESBL-phenotype K. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=8 mug/ml, and susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. Ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa (MIC50/MIC90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). Acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam MIC50/MIC90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. In summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated potent activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in U.S. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Microbial production of short-chain alkanes.
AB  - Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems  have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-ACPs, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. A modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of SCAs consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester synthase (atfA) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE(mut)).
TI  - Disintegration of aerobic granules: role of second messenger cyclic di-GMP.
AB  - Loss of structural stability of aerobic granular process is the challenge for its field applications to treat wastewaters. The second messenger, cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), is widely used by bacteria to regulate the synthesis of exopolysaccharide. This study for the first time confirmed the correlation between concentration of intracellular c-di-GMP and the granular stability under sequencing batch reactor (MBR) mode. In the presence of manganese ions (Mn(2+)), the concentrations of intracellular c-di-GMP and of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins in granules were declined. Clone library study revealed that the polysaccharide producers. Acinetobacter sp., Thauera sp., Bdellovibrio sp. and Paracoccus sp. were lost after Mn(2+) addition. The findings reported herein confirmed that the c-di-GMP is a key chemical factor epistatic to quorum sensing to determine granular stability. Stimulation of synthesis of intracellular c-di-GMP presents a potential way to enhance long-term stability of aerobic granules.
TI  - Function of a glutamine synthetase-like protein in bacterial aniline oxidation via gamma-glutamylanilide.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA has five genes (atdA1 to atdA5) involved in aniline  oxidation as a part of the aniline degradation gene cluster. From sequence analysis, the five genes were expected to encode a glutamine synthetase (GS)-like protein (AtdA1), a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein (AtdA2), and an aromatic compound dioxygenase (AtdA3, AtdA4, and AtdA5) (M. Takeo, T. Fujii, and Y. Maeda, J. Ferment. Bioeng. 85:17-24, 1998). A recombinant Pseudomonas strain harboring these five genes quantitatively converted aniline into catechol, demonstrating that catechol is the major oxidation product from aniline. To elucidate the function of the GS-like protein AtdA1 in aniline oxidation, we purified it from recombinant Escherichia coli harboring atdA1. The purified AtdA1 protein produced gamma-glutamylanilide (gamma-GA) quantitatively from aniline and l-glutamate in the presence of ATP and MgCl2. This reaction was identical to glutamine synthesis by GS, except for the use of aniline instead of ammonia as the substrate. Recombinant Pseudomonas strains harboring the dioxygenase genes (atdA3 to atdA5) were unable to degrade aniline but converted gamma-GA into catechol, indicating that gamma-GA is an intermediate to catechol and a direct substrate for the dioxygenase. Unexpectedly, a recombinant Pseudomonas strain harboring only atdA2 hydrolyzed gamma-GA into aniline, reversing the gamma-GA formation by AtdA1. Deletion of atdA2 from atdA1 to atdA5 caused gamma-GA accumulation from aniline in recombinant Pseudomonas cells and inhibited the growth of a recombinant Acinetobacter strain on aniline, suggesting that AtdA2 prevents gamma-GA accumulation that is harmful to the host cell.
TI  - Coral-associated bacteria, quorum sensing disrupters, and the regulation of biofouling.
AB  - Marine biofouling, the settlement of microorganisms and macroorganisms on structures submerged in seawater, although economically detrimental, is a successful strategy for survival in hostile environments, where coordinated bacterial communities establish biofilms via the regulation of quorum sensing (QS) communication systems. The inhibition of QS activity among bacteria isolated from different coral species was investigated to gain further insight into its potency in the attenuation, or even the prevention, of undesirable biofouling on marine organisms. It is hypothesized that coral mucus/microorganism interactions are competitive, suggesting that the dominant communities secrete QS disruptive compounds. One hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were collected from healthy coral species and screened for their ability to inhibit QS using three bioreporter strains. Approximately 12, 11, and 24% of the isolates exhibited anti-QS activity against Escherichia coli pSB1075, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens KYC55 indicator strains, respectively. Isolates with positive activity against the bioluminescent monitor strains were scanned via a cytotoxic/genotoxic, E. coli TV1061 and DPD2794 antimicrobial panel. Isolates detected by C. violaceum CV026 and A. tumefaciens KYC55 reporter strains were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of these reporter strains, which were found to be unaffected. Tests of the Favia sp. coral isolate Fav 2-50-7 (>98% similarity to Vibrio harveyi) for its ability to attenuate the formation of biofilm showed extensive inhibitory activity against biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. To ascertain the stability and general structure of the active compound, cell-free culture supernatants exposed to an increasing temperature gradient or to digestion by proteinase K, were shown to maintain potent QS attenuation and the ability to inhibit the growth of biofilms. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of a low molecular mass compound. The anti-QS strategy exemplified in the coral mucus is a model with potentially wide applications, including countering the ecological threat posed by biofilms. Manipulating synchronized bacterial behavior by detecting new QS inhibitors will facilitate the discovery of new antifouling compounds.
TI  - Stability of airborne microbes in the Louvre Museum over time.
AB  - The microbial content of air has as yet been little described, despite its public health implications, and there remains a lack of environmental microbial data on airborne microflora in enclosed spaces. In this context, the aim of this study was to characterize the diversity and dynamics of airborne microorganisms in the Louvre Museum using high-throughput molecular tools and to underline the microbial signature of indoor air in this human-occupied environment. This microbial community was monitored for 6 month during occupied time. The quantitative results revealed variations in the concentrations of less than one logarithm, with average values of 10(3) and 10(4) Escherichia coli/Aspergillus fumigatus genome equivalent per m(3) for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Our observations highlight the stability of the indoor airborne bacterial diversity over time, while the corresponding eukaryote community was less stable. Bacterial diversity characterized by pyrosequencing 454 showed high diversity dominated by the Proteobacteria which represented 51.1%, 46.9%, and 38.4% of sequences, for each of the three air samples sequenced. A common bacterial diversity was underlined, corresponding to 58.4% of the sequences. The core species were belonging mostly to the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and to the genus Paracoccus spp., Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Enhydrobacter sp., Sphingomonas sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Increased lysine content is the main characteristic of the soluble form of the polyamide cyanophycin synthesized by recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Cyanophycin, a polyamide of cyanobacterial or noncyanobacterial origin consisting of aspartate, arginine, and lysine, was synthesized in different recombinant strains of Escherichia coli expressing cphA from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308 or PCC 6803, Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1. The molar aspartate/arginine/lysine ratio of the water-soluble form isolated from a recombinant strain expressing CphA6308 was 1:0.5:0.5, with a lysine content higher than any ever described before. The water-insoluble form consisted instead of mainly aspartate and arginine residues and had a lower proportion of lysine, amounting to a maximum of only 5 mol%. It could be confirmed that the synthesis of soluble cyanobacterial granule polypeptide (CGP) is independent of the origin of cphA. Soluble CGP isolated from all recombinant strains contained a least 17 mol% lysine. The total CGP portion of cell dry matter synthesized by CphA6308 from recombinant E. coli was about 30% (wt/wt), including 23% (wt/wt) soluble CGP, by using terrific broth complex medium for cultivation at 30 degrees C for 72 h. Enhanced production of soluble CGP instead of its insoluble form is interesting for further application and makes recombinant E. coli more attractive as a suitable source for the production of polyaspartic acid or dipeptides. In addition, a new low-cost, time-saving, effective, and common isolation procedure for mainly soluble CGP, suitable for large-scale application, was established in this study.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Bloodstream infection among adults in Phnom Penh, Cambodia: key pathogens and resistance patterns.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSI) cause important morbidity and mortality  worldwide. In Cambodia, no surveillance data on BSI are available so far. METHODS: From all adults presenting with SIRS at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of HOPE (July 2007-December 2010), 20 ml blood was cultured. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques; antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed using disk diffusion and MicroScan(R), with additional E-test, D-test and double disk test where applicable, according to CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 5714 samples from 4833 adult patients yielded 501 clinically significant organisms (8.8%) of which 445 available for further analysis. The patients' median age was 45 years (range 15-99 y), 52.7% were women. HIV-infection and diabetes were present in 15.6% and 8.8% of patients respectively. The overall mortality was 22.5%. Key pathogens included Escherichia coli (n = 132; 29.7%), Salmonella spp. (n = 64; 14.4%), Burkholderia pseudomallei (n = 56; 12.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 53; 11.9%). Methicillin resistance was seen in 10/46 (21.7%) S. aureus; 4 of them were co-resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP). We noted combined resistance to amoxicillin, SMX-TMP and ciprofloxacin in 81 E. coli isolates (62.3%); 62 isolates (47.7%) were confirmed as producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Salmonella isolates displayed high rates of multidrug resistance (71.2%) with high rates of decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (90.0%) in Salmonella Typhi while carbapenem resistance was observed in 5.0% of 20 Acinetobacter sp. isolates. CONCLUSIONS: BSI in Cambodian adults is mainly caused by difficult-to-treat pathogens. These data urge for microbiological capacity building, nationwide surveillance and solid interventions to contain antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in bacterial isolates from a delhi hospital: one year outcomes.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance and hospital acquired infections have become an important public health issue. Data on pathogen and antibiotic resistance is important for physicians, microbiologists and infection control officials but limited information on antibiotic resistance prevents pathogen specific therapy and propels antibiotic misuse. A retrospective review of bacterial isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in the in- and outpatients of a Delhi hospital between January 2009-December 2009 was performed. A total of 1772 pathogens causing bacterial infections were recorded during the study period January 2009-December 2009. The most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens were Escherichia coli (40.51%), Klebsiella spp. (14.84%) and Staphylococcus aureus (13.99%). We encountered high resistance to ciprofloxacin in Enterobactereaceae family, i.e., 32.5%. Aminoglycosides, once considered optimum for broad spectrum coverage of pathogens for almost all systemic infections, are now showing high rate of resistance as was noted in Acinetobacter sp. (57.14%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (69.2%). Antibiotic susceptibility results show a higher level of resistance to cotrimoxazole, cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin which are easily available, orally administered and cheaper and thus are considered a better option for the patients. This study provides insight into the problem of resistance in bacterial pathogens in Delhi. Our results demonstrated that, in general, isolates have high rates of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in developing countries. Guidelines for surveillance and prevention of nosocomial infections must be implemented in order to reduce the rate of hospital acquired infections.
TI  - Molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in China.
AB  - The molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in Jinan, China. Out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance were found. These isolates were classified into 19 REP-PCR types. These strains were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and found to be as follows: Proteus mirabilis (16), Escherichia coli (7), Providencia spp. (7), Proteus spp. (2), P. vulgaris (3), Shigella sp. (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). Their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and then either analyzed using PCR-RFLP or sequenced. The typical array dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 was detected in 27 isolates. Six atypical arrays were observed, including three kinds of novel arrangements (linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1-orf441 or linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1, dfrA1-catB2-sat2-aadA1, and estX(Vr)-sat2-aadA1) and a hybrid with the 3'CS of class 1 integrons (dfrA1-sat2-aadA1-qacH), and dfrA1-sat1. Twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. Several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. Results showed that water sources in the Jinan region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - AtaA, a new member of the trimeric autotransporter adhesins from Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 mediating high adhesiveness to various abiotic surfaces.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 exhibits an autoagglutinating nature and noteworthy adhesiveness to various abiotic surfaces from hydrophobic plastics to hydrophilic glass and stainless steel. Although previous studies have suggested that bacterionanofibers on Tol 5 cells are involved in the adhesive phenotype of Tol 5, the fiber that directly mediates Tol 5 adhesion has remained unknown. Here, we present a new member of trimeric autotransporter adhesins designated AtaA, which we discovered by analyzing a less adhesive mutant of Tol 5, T1, obtained by transposon mutagenesis. AtaA forms thinner and shorter nanofibers than fimbriae on Tol 5 cells. We performed target disruption of ataA by allelic marker exchange, and the resulting DeltaataA strain was complemented with ataA on the Escherichia coli-Acinetobacter shuttle vector, which was newly constructed. These results proved that AtaA is essential for Tol 5's autoagglutinating nature and high adhesiveness to surfaces of various materials. In addition, the adhesiveness to solid surfaces mediated by AtaA is notably higher than that mediated by YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica WA-314. Moreover, and importantly, these characteristics can be conferred to the non-adhesive, non-agglutinating bacterium Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 in trans by transformation with ataA, with expected applications to microbial immobilization.
TI  - Comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term Indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): Acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  - In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.
TI  - [CHROMagar KPC. Comparison with the method proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) for rectal screening and evaluation of false positive results].
AB  - Eighty one rectal swabs (RS) were cultured on CHROMagar KPC and the CDC method. Of the 81 samples, 9 were positive for KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae on CHROMagar KPC, and 6 for the CDC method. CHROMagar KPC had two false positive (FP) results: 1 K. pneumoniae and 1 Acinetobacter sp. FP results on the CDC method were: 25 Acinetobacter spp., 2 Escherichia coli and 4 K. pneumoniae: CHROMagar KPC yielded a better recovery of KPC-producing bacteria and less FP results than CDC method. In order to evaluate FP results on CHROMagar KPC, 1247 RS were cultured and yielded 1021 negatives, 171 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and 55 FP (4.4 %). Because of the FP results growing on CHROMagar KPC, KPC must be phenotypically confirmed in the bacteria isolated.
TI  - In vivo-validated essential genes identified in Acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  - A critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. For bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media. This study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. Mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. A subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. The putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, DNA/RNA synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. These A. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other Gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the Database of Essential Genes (DEG), including those of Acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. However, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. None of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of FDA-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. IMPORTANCE: The human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. This scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective against antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli. This study identified a set of A. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. Furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the Database of Essential Genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. Lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria has been identified.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  - Microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. However, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in China. We conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (NI) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from January 2003 to December 2010. We studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. The number of NIs per 100 admissions was 10.9. The commonest isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and Candida (11.4%). The result indicated that the numbers of patients with Acinetobacter sp. infection increased (P=0.004), but with Proteus mirabilis infection decreased (P=0.004). The isolated Acinetobacter sp. and P. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost all antibiotics tested. Notably, more frequent Acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the P. aeruginosa and E. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Cloning of a dibutyl phthalate hydrolase gene from Acinetobacter sp. strain M673  and functional analysis of its expression product in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A dibutyl phthalate (DBP) transforming bacterium, strain M673, was isolated and identified as Acinetobacter sp. This strain could not grow on dialkyl phthalates, including dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dipentyl, dihexyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), di-n-octyl, and dinonyl phthalate, but suspensions of cells could transform these compounds to phthalate via corresponding monoalkyl phthalates. During growth in Luria-Bertani medium, M673 produced the high amounts of non-DBP-induced intracellular hydrolase in the stationary phase. One DBP hydrolase gene containing an open reading frame of 1,095 bp was screened from a genomic library, and its expression product hydrolyzed various dialkyl phthalates to the corresponding monoalkyl phthalates.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Evaluation of adhesiveness of Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 to abiotic surfaces.
AB  - The toluene-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 shows a highly adhesive and autoagglutinating nature through cell surface nanofibers. In the present study, various aspects of the adhesiveness of Tol 5 cells were evaluated, namely, the association with biofilm formation, the specificity, and the effects of additives. During growth, Tol 5 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells showed high capacities to form biofilms. However, resting PAO1 cells barely adhered to a polystyrene (PS) surface, while a large number of resting Tol 5 cells rapidly adhered. This implies that Tol 5 cells are intrinsically adhesive and that their initial attachment ability is quite high and distinguishable from their ability to form biofilm. This high adhesiveness of Tol 5 cells was considered to be nonspecific because the cells adhered to various material surfaces from hydrophobic plastic surfaces to hydrophilic glass and metal surfaces. However, Tol 5 cells were found not to be adhesive to Escherichia coli cells. Although Tol 5 cells were capable of interspecies interaction and coagglutination with E. coli cells, at the surface of cell clumps, E. coli cells localized, suggesting that they disturbed autoagglutination of Tol 5 cells. Tol 5 has a hydrophobic cell surface. However, the addition of nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 and bovine serum albumin increased the adhesion of Tol 5 cells to a PS surface, in contrast to previous reports of hydrophobic bacteria. The results highlighted the interesting features of adhesiveness of Tol 5 cells.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in isolated bacteria  from seawater of Algiers beaches (Algeria).
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in Algiers. The most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. According to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%), and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). Thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), Pseudomonas fluorescens (7), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Burkholderia cepacia (2), Bordetella sp. (1), Pantoea sp. (1), Acinetobacter baumannii (1), Chryseomonas luteola (1), Ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and Escherichia coli (1). Screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase in the E. coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the IncI1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. Insertion sequence ISEcp1B was located upstream of the CTX-M-15 gene. This work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. Transmissible CTX-M-15 was detected in E. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.
TI  - Optimization of Fenton process for decoloration and COD removal in tobacco wastewater and toxicological evaluation of the effluent.
AB  - Decoloration and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in tobacco wastewater by Fenton process has been optimized under 25 +/- 2 degrees C. The results showed that the optimal range of conditions were pH 4.13-4.66, Fe(2+) 0.29-0.34 g/L and H2O2 > or = 2.73 g/L. Within this range, up to 95% of colour and 90% of COD was removed. In an enlarged system, setting the optimal conditions as pH 4.50, Fe(2+) 0.34 g/L and H2O2 4.00 g/L, the colour removal rate was 96.03 +/- 2.57%, with COD removal rate of 93.30 +/- 2.92%. The residual COD of 73.67 +/- 19.70 mg/L in effluent had hit the State's first-class standard for the industrial discharge in China (< 100 mg/L COD, GB8978-1996). The ecological safety of Fenton process has also been evaluated. When reaction completed, the content of hydroxyl free radical (OH) was 3.26 +/- 0.44 mg/L. There was no inhibition of Fenton effluent in growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp. HF-1, Acinetobacter sp. TW and Sphingomonas sp. TY. No oxidative stress was induced on strain HF-1 by Fenton effluent. Thus, Fenton process was one of high-efficiency and ecologically safe strategy for tobacco wastewater advanced treatment.
TI  - Prevalence of uropathogens in diabetic patients and their corresponding resistance pattern: results of a survey conducted at diagnostic centers in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infection is the second most common clinical indication for empirical antibiotic treatment in primary and secondary health care settings. The incidence of diabetes mellitus throughout the world is increasing strikingly and in the long run, it has some major effects on the genitourinary system which makes diabetic patients more liable to urinary tract infection. This study is designed to reveal the distribution of uropathogens in diabetic patients according to age and sex, and corresponding resistance patterns. METHODS: A six-month retrospective review of urine culture assay data from August 2009 to January 2010 from randomly selected 85 patients who suffered from both urinary tract infection and diabetes was conducted. Relevant information was retrieved and analyzed statistically using Microsoft(R) Excel 2002 software. RESULTS: The study showed that females are more vulnerable to pathogenic attack than males throughout a wide age distribution. In terms of pathogenic distribution, Escherichia coli was the highest followed by Streptococcus sp., Acinetobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae and few others. Though Meropenem showed no resistance with E. coli, Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in the case of Streptococcus sp. it exhibited resistance of 25%. Amikacin exhibited only 3% resistance with E. coli, whereas no resistance with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and most interestingly showed 75% resistance with Streptococcus sp. Gentamicin exhibited no resistance with Acinetobacter while 26.9%, 50% and 87.5% resistance with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus sp. respectively. Hence, Nitrofurantoin exhibited less resistance 11.9% compared to 12.5% resistance with E. coli and Streptococcus sp. Nitrofurantoin was highly prone to resistance with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100%, 50% respectively). Cephalosporins (cephradine, cefixime, ceftriaxone, cefepime etc.) showed moderate resistance (avg. 50%), whereas amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance in all these cases. CONCLUSION: Pathogens are mostly resistant to antibiotics including amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin, with few exceptions including gentamicin, amikacin and meropenem.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Cloning, expression of a peroxiredoxin gene from Acinetobacter sp. SM04 and characterization of its recombinant protein for zearalenone detoxification.
AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) is a Fusarium mycotoxin, which has been associated with hyperestrogenism and other reproductive disorders in farm animals. ZEN-contaminated grains as well as its by-products had engendered numerous economic losses to farm animals' production, so the detoxification of ZEN-contaminated grains and its by-products would be necessary and beneficial. In this study, a peroxiredoxin (Prx) gene from Acinetobacter sp. SM04 was cloned, and over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The Prx gene of Acinetobacter sp. SM04 encodes a protein of 187 amino acids residues and NCBI BLAST program analysis of deduced amino acids shows high identity with 2-Cys Prx family. Interestingly, recombinant Prx show efficient ability to degrade ZEN using H(2)O(2). Results of MCF-7 cell proliferation assay also found ZEN were oxidized into little estrogenic metabolites by purified recombinant Prx plus H(2)O(2). Further, model experiments on decontamination of ZEN-contaminated corn using recombinant Prx were performed, and results found nearly 90% of ZEN was degraded when crushed ZEN-contaminated corn samples (nearly 1,000 mug ZEN per kg grain) were treated with purified recombinant Prx plus 0.09% (m/m) H(2)O(2) for 6h at 30 degrees C. In addition, the optimum pH and temperature of purified recombinant Prx for ZEN degradation were 9.0 and 70 degrees C respectively.
TI  - Regioselective omega-hydroxylation of medium-chain n-alkanes and primary alcohols by CYP153 enzymes from Mycobacterium marinum and Polaromonas sp. strain JS666.
AB  - The oxofunctionalization of saturated hydrocarbons is an important goal in basic  and applied chemistry. Biocatalysts like cytochrome P450 enzymes can introduce oxygen into a wide variety of molecules in a very selective manner, which can be used for the synthesis of fine and bulk chemicals. Cytochrome P450 enzymes from the CYP153A subfamily have been described as alkane hydroxylases with high terminal regioselectivity. Here we report the product yields resulting from C(5)-C(12) alkane and alcohol oxidation catalyzed by CYP153A enzymes from Mycobacterium marinum (CYP153A16) and Polaromonas sp. (CYP153A P. sp.). For all reactions, byproduct formation is described in detail. Following cloning and expression in Escherichia coli, the activity of the purified monooxygenases was reconstituted with putidaredoxin (CamA) and putidaredoxin reductase (CamB). Although both enzyme systems yielded primary alcohols and alpha,omega-alkanediols, each one displayed a different oxidation pattern towards alkanes. For CYP153A P. sp. a predominant omega-hydroxylation activity was observed, while CYP153A16 possessed the ability to catalyze both omega-hydroxylation and alpha,omega-dihydroxylation reactions.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. We aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between July 2008 and August 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a Taiwan medical center were enrolled. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with VITEK-2 system and was analyzed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. We followed USA Food and Drug Administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. RESULTS: The median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. After tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. A baumannii and P aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. The tigecycline susceptibility rate of A baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were A baumannii and P aeruginosa. Tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of A baumannii, methicillin-resistant S aureus, E coli, and K pneumoniae. Exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of A baumannii for tigecycline.
TI  - A novel cold-adapted lipase from Acinetobacter sp. XMZ-26: gene cloning and characterisation.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. XMZ-26 (ACCC 05422) was isolated from soil samples obtained from glaciers in Xinjiang Province, China. The partial nucleotide sequence of a lipase gene was obtained by touchdown PCR using degenerate primers designed based on the conserved domains of cold-adapted lipases. Subsequently, a complete gene sequence encoding a 317 amino acid polypeptide was identified. Our novel lipase gene, lipA, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (LipA) was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography, and then deeply characterised. The LipA resulted to hydrolyse pNP esters of fatty acids with acyl chain length from C2 to C16, and the preferred substrate was pNP octanoate showing a k(cat) = 560.52 +/- 28.32 s(-1), K(m) = 0.075 +/- 0.008 mM, and a k(cat)/K(m) = 7,377.29 +/- 118.88 s(-1) mM(-1). Maximal LipA activity was observed at a temperature of 15 degrees C and pH 10.0 using pNP decanoate as substrate. That LipA peaked at such a low temperature and remained most activity between 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C indicated that it was a cold-adapted enzyme. Remarkably, this lipase retained much of its activity in the presence of commercial detergents and organic solvents, including Ninol, Triton X-100, methanol, PEG-600, and DMSO. This cold-adapted lipase may find applications in the detergent industry and organic synthesis.
TI  - Effects on Salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating  hens' eggs with chitosan.
AB  - Chitosan is a biopolymer with antimicrobial activity and film-forming properties. In this study, the effects on Salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating hens' eggs with chitosan was evaluated. A chitosan was selected from eight types (four non-commercial and four commercial) based on its antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). For this purpose, a contact plate method was developed and chitosans were applied at a concentration of 0.25% (w/v). A commercial type with a molecular weight of 310-375 kDa and a deacetylation degree of 75% that reduced S. Enteritidis by 0.71 log(10) colony forming units compared to the control (without chitosan) was selected for further studies. The chitosan was shown to have antimicrobial activity against other egg borne bacteria, i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii, Alcaligenes sp., Carnobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus warneri, and against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. The effects of various concentrations of the selected chitosan (0.25%, 1% and 2%) on Salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration were assessed using the agar molding technique. Effective reduction of eggshell contamination could not be demonstrated, but trans-shell penetration was significantly reduced in the presence of a 2% chitosan eggshell coating, with only 6.1% of the eggs being penetrated compared to 24.5% of the uncoated eggs. It was concluded that the 2% chitosan coating has the potential to reduce contamination of egg contents resulting from trans-shell penetration by S. Enteritidis.
TI  - The effect of age on the bacteria isolated and the antibiotic-sensitivity pattern in infections among cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are predisposed to infections. Antimicrobial patterns and antibiotic sensitivity change with increasing age, making choice of empirical therapy more complicated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center study aims to try and assess the influence of age on microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity of organisms causing infection in patients with malignant disease. RESULTS: The five most common bacterial pathogens isolated were Pseudomonas sp (245, 26.2%) > Enterocococcus sp (109, 11.66%) > Staphylococcus aureus (107, 11.44%) > Escherichia coli (106, 11.34%) > Klebsiella sp (99, 10.59%). There was no significant change in the distribution of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with age. However, there was an increase in the occurrence of the Enterobacteriacea group and a decrease in infections caused by nonlactose fermenters with increasing age. The ESBL production increased from 10.52% (12-19 years) to 24.88% (> 50 years) as did oxacillin resistance (from 14.3% to 28.1%) among S. aureus isolates. The activity of most antimicrobial agents decreased with increasing age. The decreasing trend of activity was statistically significant for meropenam (73.3-41.2%) against Pseudomonas sp. and for the activity of the aminoglycosides for Acinetobacter sp (61.1-17.4% for amikacin). CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that empirical antibiotic therapy needs to be changed on the basis of the age of the patient. It also appears that combination therapy is essential for the empirical treatment of infections in elderly patients with cancer.
TI  - [Changes in the bacterial spectrum in severe burn wounds].
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the time axis for increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients hospitalized at the Clinic of burns and reconstructive surgery between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled in the study. The major criteria for enrolment were more than 15% of total body surface area (TBSA) burned, hospital stay of 1 month or more and age over 18 years. Specimens for microbiological examination were collected on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20 after admission. RESULTS: A total of 777 bacterial strains were isolated from the study patients, with 64.6% of these strains being Gram positive and 35.4% Gram negative. The most frequently isolated Gram positive pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (260 strains) and Bacillus sp. (113 strains), while the most common Gram negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains), Escherichia coli (63 strains) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (57 strains). CONCLUSION: The study provided data that supports the assumption of increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. Nevertheless, even on day 20 after admission, such strains did not predominate.
TI  - Rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most plasmids replicate only within a particular genus or family. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe an engineered high copy number expression vector, pBAV1K-T5, that produces varying quantities of active reporter proteins in Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, (all gram-negative), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Leifsonia shinshuensis, Peanibacillus sp. S18-36 and Bacillus subtilis (gram-positive). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate the efficiency of pBAV1K-T5 replication in different bacterial species, thereby facilitating the study of proteins that don't fold well in E. coli and pathogens not amenable to existing genetic tools.
TI  - Genomics-driven reconstruction of acinetobacter NAD metabolism: insights for antibacterial target selection.
AB  - Enzymes involved in the last steps of NAD biogenesis, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NadD) and NAD synthetase (NadE), are conserved and essential in most bacterial species and are established targets for antibacterial drug development. Our genomics-based reconstruction of NAD metabolism in the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii revealed unique features suggesting an alternative targeting strategy. Indeed, genomes of all analyzed Acinetobacter species do not encode NadD, which is functionally replaced by its distant homolog NadM. We combined bioinformatics with genetic and biochemical techniques to elucidate this and other important features of Acinetobacter NAD metabolism using a model (nonpathogenic) strain Acinetobacter baylyi sp. ADP1. Thus, a comparative kinetic characterization of PncA, PncB, and NadV enzymes allowed us to suggest distinct physiological roles for the two alternative, deamidating and nondeamidating, routes of nicotinamide salvage/recycling. The role of the NiaP transporter in both nicotinate and nicotinamide salvage was confirmed. The nondeamidating route was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by an ADP-ribose-responsive repressor NrtR. The NadM enzyme was shown to possess dual substrate specificity toward both nicotinate and nicotinamide mononucleotide substrates, which is consistent with its essential role in all three routes of NAD biogenesis, de novo synthesis as well as the two salvage pathways. The experimentally confirmed unconditional essentiality of nadM provided support for the choice of the respective enzyme as a drug target. In contrast, nadE, encoding a glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase, proved to be dispensable when the nondeamidating salvage pathway functioned as the only route of NAD biogenesis.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  - Culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a German dairy company and a Spanish dry cured ham company. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. Autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised DGGE DNA bands. More specifically, real-time PCR was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella spp, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to the detection limits of the real-time PCR method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. Autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. Only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the German dairy company. Enterococci and P.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. Some opportunistic bacteria as Enterobacter sp., Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic Bacillus, were also detected after DNA sequencing of DGGE bands.
TI  - In vitro properties of BAL30072, a novel siderophore sulfactam with activity against multiresistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BAL30072 is a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic belonging to the sulfactams.  Its spectrum of activity against significant Gram-negative pathogens with beta-lactam-resistant phenotypes was evaluated and was compared with the activities of reference drugs, including aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. BAL30072 showed potent activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. isolates, including many carbapenem-resistant strains. The MIC(90)s were 4 microg/ml for MDR Acinetobacter spp. and 8 microg/ml for MDR P. aeruginosa, whereas the MIC(90) of meropenem for the same sets of isolates was >32 microg/ml. BAL30072 was bactericidal against both Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, even against strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases that conferred resistance to all other beta-lactams tested, including aztreonam. It was also active against many species of MDR isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including isolates that had a class A carbapenemase or a metallo-beta-lactamase. Unlike other monocyclic beta-lactams, BAL30072 was found to trigger the spheroplasting and lysis of Escherichia coli rather than the formation of extensive filaments. The basis for this unusual property is its inhibition of the bifunctional penicillin-binding proteins PBP 1a and PBP 1b, in addition to its high affinity for PBP 3, which is the target of monobactams, such as aztreonam.
TI  - Bacteremia among Jordanian children at Princess Rahmah Hospital: Pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate microorganisms causing bacteremia in Jordanian children and to assess their sensitivity to various groups of antimicrobials. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on positive blood cultures taken from 378 children aged below 15 year, who sought medical attention at Princess Rahmah Hospital between January and December/2008. RESULTS: Out of 4475 tested blood samples, 378 isolates were recovered from blood cultures. The male to female isolate ratio was (1.26:1.0). The most frequent pathogen found was Staphylococcus aureus (86.2%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (9%), Escherichia coli (1.9%), Streptococcus spp. (1.9%), Pseudomonas spp. (0.8%), and Acinetobacter sp. was found in only one culture (0.3%). The susceptibility rate of S. aureus was recorded the highest (99.6%) for vancomycin, and the lowest susceptibility rate (3.2%) was recorded for aztreonam. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus was the main isolate in bacteremic children, with all isolates demonstrating susceptibility to vancomycin. Overall, aztreonam resistance was near 97%, and this rate was not affected by sex and blood isolate type. This information should be considered when empirical therapy is recommended or prescribed for children with bacteremia.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Identification and characterization of integron mediated antibiotic resistance in pentachlorophenol degrading bacterium isolated from the chemostat.
AB  - A bacterial consortium was developed by continuous enrichment of microbial population isolated from sediment core of pulp and paper mill effluent in mineral salts medium (MSM) supplemented with pentachlorophenol (PCP) as sole source of carbon and energy in the chemostat. The consortia contained three bacterial strains. They were identified as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Acinetobacter sp. readily degraded PCP through the formation of tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TecH), 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol and products of ortho ring cleavage detected by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Out of the three acclimated PCP degrading bacterial strains only one strain, Acinetobacter sp. showed the presence of integron gene cassette as a marker of its stability and antibiotic resistance. The strain possessed a 4.17 kb amplicon with 22 ORF's. The plasmid isolated from the Acinetobacter sp. was subjected to shotgun cloning through restriction digestion by BamHI, HindIII and SalI, ligated to pUC19 vector and transformed into E. coli XLBlue1alpha, and finally selected on MSM containing PCP as sole source of carbon and energy with ampicillin as antibiotic marker. DNA sequence analysis of recombinant clones indicated homology with integron gene cassette and multiple antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, and Hera Hospital in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2005 to March 2006. A total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. Demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. RESULTS: The most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Klebsiella sp. (6.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), Proteus sp. (3.3%), and Enterobacter sp. (1.9%). Results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. The implementation of monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.
TI  - Eradication of bacteria in suspension and biofilms using methylene blue-loaded dynamic nanoplatforms.
AB  - The bacterial killing efficiency of a dynamic nanoplatform (DNP) was evaluated. The polyacrylamide (PAA) hydrogel matrix of the DNP was loaded with methylene blue (MB) and was previously applied successfully to killing rat C6 glioma tumor cells in culture. This series of experiments is aimed at determining the suitability of this nanoplatform for elimination of bacterial infections. Suspended cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter sp. were exposed to activated ( approximately 650-nm laser light) MB-PAA-DNPs. The killing efficiency of nanoparticle mass concentration, light irradiance and fluence, and dark incubation time was determined on each of the bacterial species. Moreover, the ability of activated MB-PAA-DNPs to inhibit biofilm growth and eradicate and disperse preformed biofilms, preformed on glass and polystyrene surfaces, was demonstrated. The data revealed that activated MB-PAA-DNPs eradicated all species of bacteria examined. Also, encapsulation of MB into the PAA-DNP matrix significantly diminished the observed dark toxicity of free dye. The photobactericidal efficacy of MB-PAA-DNP was found to be higher for gram-positive bacteria than for gram-negative bacteria. In addition, activated MB-PAA-DNP can inhibit biofilm growth and eradicate almost all of the early-age biofilms that are formed by all of the bacteria examined.
TI  - Multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  - AIM: To compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (FVB) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and FVB mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative real-time PCR. DGGE fingerprints of FVB and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of DNA fragments identified as Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter sp. were only identified in DGGE profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with FVB mice at same age. CONCLUSIONS: Differences found in the caecal microbiota of FVB and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of Abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. The altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and FVB mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. The results provide evidence that Abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. Future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - [No-synthase activity in primary cultured frog urinary bladder epithielial cells  and no-dependent antimicrobial effect].
AB  - We have shown previously that endogenous NO modulates the effect of arginine-vasotocin on the increase in the osmotic water permeability of the frog urinary bladder epithelium. The aim of the present work was to develop a procedure of cultivation of epithelial cells from the frog urinary bladder as a primary culture in order to study in vitro the cellular production of NO and its regulation. Isolated cells were cultivated in modified L-15 medium with 10% FBS and gentamycin (40 microg/ml) at room temperature. Under these conditions, at least 50% cells kept their viability until 8 days of incubation. NO-synthase (NOS) activity was estimated as nitrite (NO2-) accumulation in culture medium; NO2- concentration in the presence of L-NAME, inhibitor of all NOS types, was considered as NOS-independent and was subtracted from each value. The nitrite accumulation was linear in time during 3 days of cultivation and was inhibited by 1400W, inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor, and 7-nitroindazole, constitutive NOS's inhibitor, at doses 5-50 and 10-200 microM, respectively. One-day incubation of he cells in the medium with low concentration of gentamycin (1 or 2 microg/ml) led to the significant increase in amount of bacterial in cultured fluid identified as E. coli and Acinetobacter sp. Addition of L-NAME (5 - 103 M) to the medium potentiated the bacteria growth 1.5- and 2.5-times in the presence of 2 and 1 microg gentamycin/ml, respectively. Thus, epithelial cells form the frog urinary bladder possess NO-dependent antibacterial effect which is probably provided by induction of iNOS expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the primary culture of the frog urinary bladder epithelial cells is a perspective experimental model for the study of regulation of NOS activity and NO production being of particular interest in relation to the defense effect of NO in epithelia.
TI  - A novel thermostable arylesterase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P1: purification, characterization, and expression.
AB  - A novel thermostable arylesterase, a 35-kDa monomeric enzyme, was purified from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P1. The optimum temperature and pH were 94 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. The enzyme displayed remarkable thermostability: it retained 52% of its activity after 50 h of incubation at 90 degrees C. In addition, the purified enzyme showed high stability against denaturing agents, including various detergents, urea, and organic solvents. The enzyme has broad substrate specificity besides showing an arylesterase activity toward aromatic esters: it exhibits not only carboxylesterase activity toward tributyrin and p-nitrophenyl esters containing unsubstituted fatty acids from butyrate (C(4)) to palmitate (C(16)), but also paraoxonase activity toward organophosphates such as p-nitrophenylphosphate, paraoxon, and methylparaoxon. The k(cat)/K(m) ratios of the enzyme for phenyl acetate and paraoxon, the two most preferable substrates among all tested, were 30.6 and 119.4 s(-1) microM(-1), respectively. The arylesterase gene consists of 918 bp corresponding to 306 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 34% identity with that of arylesterase from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. Furthermore, we successfully expressed active recombinant S. solfataricus arylesterase in Escherichia coli. Together, our results show that the enzyme is a serine esterase belonging to the A-esterases and contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser156, Asp251, and His281 in the active site.
TI  - Pathogenic and opportunistic gram-negative bacteria in soil, leachate and air in  San Nicolas landfill at Aguascalientes, Mexico.
AB  - The occurrence of Gram-negative pathogenic and opportunistic species, was studied for two years on air. soil and leachate from the San Nicolas Landfill. Aguascalientes, Mexico. For soil and leachate four samplings were done, two during the dry season and two during the rainy season. For soil there were 15 sampling points, the leachate samples were taken on the leachate tank. For air, twelve sampling were done in three points of the landfill. Twenty pathogenic and/or opportunistic bacteria were identified from air, twenty from soil and eleven from leachate. Most of them were enteric; however respiratory tract pathogenic bacteria were also identified. Pasteurella haemolytica were isolated in all air samples. Nine species were found in the a half of the soil samples. The most frequent species in leachate were Acinetobacter baumanii, Bordetella sp, Brucella sp. and Escherichia coli var II. The occurrence of pathogenic and opportunistic species points out to the nosocomial and domestic clinical wastes discharged in the landfill as a potential risk for public and occupational health.
TI  - Evidence from mechanistic probes for distinct hydroperoxide rearrangement mechanisms in the intradiol and extradiol catechol dioxygenases.
AB  - Three mechanistic probes were used to investigate whether the Criegee rearrangement step of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) from Acinetobacter sp. proceeds via a direct 1,2-acyl migration, via homolytic O-O cleavage, or via a benzene oxide-oxepin rearrangement. Incubation of CatA with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid led to the formation of a 9:1 mixture of 2-chlorophenol and 3-chlorophenol, via a mechanism involving O-O homolytic cleavage. Incubation of CatA with 2-hydroperoxy-2-methylcyclohexanone led to formation of 5,6-diketoheptan-1-ol, also consistent with an O-O homolytic cleavage mechanism, and not consistent with a direct 1,2-acyl migration. No reaction product was isolated from incubation of CatA with 6-hydroxymethyl-6-methylcyclohexa-2,4-dienone, an analogue that is able to undergo the benzene oxide-oxepin rearrangement, but not able to undergo O-O homolytic cleavage. In contrast, incubation of extradiol dioxygenase MhpB from Escherichia coli with 6-hydroxymethyl-6-methylcyclohexa-2,4-dienone led to the formation of a 2-tropolone ring expansion product, consistent with a direct 1,2-alkenyl migration for extradiol cleavage. Taken together, the results imply different mechanisms for the Criegee rearrangement steps of intradiol and extradiol catechol dioxygenases: a direct 1,2-alkenyl migration for extradiol cleavage and an O-O homolytic cleavage mechanism for intradiol cleavage.
TI  - Characterization of pentachlorophenol degrading bacterial consortium from chemostat.
AB  - A microbial consortium was developed by continuous enrichment of bacterial population isolated from sediment core of pulp and paper mill effluent in mineral salts medium (MSM) supplemented with pentachlorophenol (PCP) as sole source of carbon and energy in the chemostat. The enriched consortium contained three bacterial strains identified as Escherichia coli (PCP1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PCP2) and Acinetobacter sp. (PCP3) by morphological and biochemical tests, further confirmation was done using 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The potency of bacterial isolates in degradation of PCP was monitored in terms of growth and utilization of PCP as substrate with spectrophotometer and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis. The strains were tested for their utilization of various organic compounds. The strain PCP3, showed higher potency to utilize PCP as sole source of carbon and energy than PCP1 and PCP2. The bacterial strain were able to utilize PCP through an oxidative and reductive route as indicated with the formation of tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TeCH), 2-chloro-1,4-benzenediol and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, respectively.
TI  - Biotransformation of chloroaromatics: the impact of bioavailability and substrate specificity.
AB  - The effect of surfactants on the biodegradation of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene by an Escherichia coli JMI09(MI) recombinant strain, carrying a gene cluster containing the genes for benzene dioxygenase, cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida ML2, has been investigated. We observed that the efficiency of the benzene dioxygenase catalyzed conversions to cis-dihydrodiols depends on the balance among real substrate specificity, bioavailability, and toxicity effects of highly concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons. The utilization of non ionic surfactants makes it possible to partly overcome the limiting step of biodegradation processes for scarcely water soluble hydrocarbons hindered by their limited bioavailability.Furthermore the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and the extradiol catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which in the presently analyzed biodegradative pathway should further degrade the pollutants, are known, the first to be selectively specific for the (lR,2R)-dihydrodiol derivative which is not produced by the benzene dioxygenase, the second, to be dead-end inhibited by the corresponding chlorinated catechois. In the present example this results in the accumulation of the corresponding chlorinated cis-dihydrodiols which can be useful for asymmetric synthesis.On the other hand the practical utilization of the system for bioremediation purposes requires the efficient conversion of the chlorinated catechols by specific intradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenases, the crystal structures of some of these last enzymes are currently under analysis in our laboratory to understand the structuralfunctional correlations. Preliminary data show overall structures similar to the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 thus suggesting that the substrate specificity differences are mainly related to subtle differences in the catalytic site.
TI  - The current state of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in North America.
AB  - Although much of today's media focuses on multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, resistance within gram-negative bacilli continues to rise, occasionally creating situations in which few or no antibiotics that retain activity are available. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp are emerging threats nationally. Although carbapenems are considered the antibiotic class of choice to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, the ability of these organisms to produce carbapenemases has now become apparent in some regions throughout the United States. Although still rare, Klebsiella sp that produce KPC-2 retain susceptibility only to tigecycline, polymyxins, and occasionally aminoglycosides. Multidrug resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp has always been apparent across many hospitals in the United States. Recent surveillance indicates increasing resistance to all currently available antibiotics, including carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. Against many strains, only polymyxins retain activity; however, resistance has also been reported to these agents. Fortunately, resistance mechanisms such as metallo-beta-lactamases are still rare in the United States. As no new antibiotics with novel mechanisms against many of these gram-negative bacilli are expected to be developed in the foreseeable future, careful and conservative use of agents combined with good infection control practices is required.
TI  - Copper(II) complexes with ligands derived from 4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one: synthesis and biological activity.
AB  - The synthesis of Cu(II) complexes derived from Schiff base ligands obtained by the condensation of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde or terephtalic aldehyde with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one) is presented. The newly prepared compounds were characterized by( 1)H-NMR, UV-VIS, IR and ESR spectroscopy. The determination of the antimicrobial activity of the ligands and of the complexes was carried out on samples of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter boumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida sp. The qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial activity test results proved that all the prepared complexes are very active, especially against samples of Ps. aeruginosa, A. Boumanii, E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - The Acinetobacter sp. chnB promoter together with its cognate positive regulator  ChnR is an attractive new candidate for metabolic engineering applications in bacteria.
AB  - Over the last 10 years there has been an extremely fast development in the global characterization of bacteria at the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels. To further explore and apply these complex data sets there is now a need for new biological tools that can be used to test or verify hypotheses generated on the basis of all the new information. Here, we report the integration of an expression cassette based on the Acinetobacter sp. chnB promoter and its cognate positive regulator chnR gene into a replicon derived from the broad-host-range plasmid RK2. Cyclohexanone was found to be the most efficient inducer of this system in Escherichia coli, using firefly luciferase as a reporter. To explore the potential of the system in another species, we show that the system can be used in combination with another similar expression cassette (Pm/xylS) to control the monomer composition of the industrially widely used exopolysaccharide alginate, produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens.
TI  - Purification and characterization of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from the aniline degradation pathway of Acinetobacter sp. YAA and its mutant enzyme, which resists substrate inhibition.
AB  - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), a key enzyme in the meta-cleavage pathway of catechol metabolism, was purified from cell extract of recombinant Escherichia coli JM109 harboring the C23O gene (atdB) cloned from an aniline-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. YAA. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography analysis suggested that the enzyme (AtdB) has a molecular mass of 35 kDa as a monomer and forms a tetrameric structure. It showed relative meta-cleavage activities for the following catechols tested: catechol (100%), 3-methylcatechol (19%), 4-methylcatechol (57%), 4-chlorocatechol (46%), and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (5%). To elevate the activity, a DNA self-shuffling experiment was carried out using the atdB gene. One mutant enzyme, named AtdBE286K, was obtained. It had one amino acid substitution, E286K, and showed 2.4-fold higher C23O activity than the wild-type enzyme at 100 microM. Kinetic analysis of these enzymes revealed that the wild-type enzyme suffered from substrate inhibition at >2 microM, while the mutant enzyme loosened substrate inhibition.
TI  - Probing the molecular determinants of aniline dioxygenase substrate specificity by saturation mutagenesis.
AB  - Aniline dioxygenase is a multicomponent Rieske nonheme-iron dioxygenase enzyme isolated from Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA. Saturation mutagenesis of the substrate-binding pocket residues, which were identified using a homology model of the alpha subunit of the terminal dioxygenase (AtdA3), was used to probe the molecular determinants of AtdA substrate specificity. The V205A mutation widened the substrate specificity of aniline dioxygenase to include 2-isopropylaniline, for which the wild-type enzyme has no activity. The V205A mutation also made 2-isopropylaniline a better substrate for the enzyme than 2,4-dimethylaniline, a native substrate of the wild-type enzyme. The I248L mutation improved the activity of aniline dioxygenase against aniline and 2,4-dimethylaniline approximately 1.7-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively. Thus, it is shown that the alpha subunit of the terminal dioxygenase indeed plays a part in the substrate specificity as well as the activity of aniline dioxygenase. Interestingly, the equivalent residues of V205 and I248 have not been previously reported to influence the substrate specificity of other Rieske dioxygenases. These results should facilitate future engineering of the enzyme for bioremediation and industrial applications.
TI  - Evaluation of biosorption potency of Acinetobacter sp. for removal of hexavalent  chromium from tannery effluent.
AB  - Two bacterial consortia were developed by continuous enrichment of microbial population of tannery and pulp and paper mill effluent contained Serratia mercascens, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. identified by 16S rDNA method. The consortia evaluated for removal of chromate [(Cr(VI)] in shake flask culture indicated pulp and paper mill consortium had more potential for removal of chromate. Acinetobacter sp. isolated from pulp and paper mill consortium removed higher amount of chromate [Cr(VI)] under aerobic conditions. Parameters optimized in different carbon, nitrogen sources, and pH, indicated maximum removal of chromate in sodium acetate (0.2%), sodium nitrate (0.1%) and pH 7 by Acinetobacter sp. Bacteria was applied in 2-l bioreactor significantly removed chromate after 3 days. The results of the study indicated removal of more than 75% chromium by Acinetobacter sp. determined by diphenylcarbazide colorimetric assay and atomic absorption spectrophotometer after 7 days. Study of microbial [Cr(VI)] removal and identification of reduction intermediates has been hindered by the lack of analytical techniques. Therefore, removal of chromium was further substantiated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) which indicated bioaccumulation of chromium in the bacterial cells.
TI  - Bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface.
AB  - Understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and/or large droplets routes. The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 microm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40-45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35-40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.
TI  - Ice-active characteristics of soil bacteria selected by ice-affinity.
AB  - As an initial screen for microorganisms that produce ice-active macromolecules, ice-affinity was used to select microorganisms from soil consortia originating from three temperate regions. Once selected and subsequently purified to single colonies, these microbes were putatively identified by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and assayed for various ice-active properties. Ice-affinity selection appeared to select for bacteria with ice-associating activities: inhibition of ice recrystallization; ice nucleation; ice shaping. Although none of these activities were observed in Paenibacillus amyloliticus C8, others such as Chryseobacterium sp. GL8, demonstrated both ice recrystallization inhibition and ice-shaping activities. Pseudomonas borealis DL7 was classified as a type I ice nucleator, Flavobacterium sp. GL7, was identified as a type III ice nucleator and Acinetobacter radioresistens DL5 demonstrated ice recrystallization inhibition. In all, 19 different culturable bacteria were selected from the thousands of microbes in late-summer collected soil samples. Many of the selected microbes have been previously reported in glacial ice cores or polar sea ice, and of five isolates that were further characterized, four showed ice-associating activities. These results indicate the significant potential of ice-affinity selection even with temperate climate soils, suggesting that sampling in more extreme and remote areas is not required for the isolation of ice-active bacteria.
TI  - Production of alpha, omega-alkanediols using Escherichia coli expressing a cytochrome P450 from Acinetobacter sp. OC4.
AB  - Our biotransformation using Escherichia coli expressing a cytochrome P450 (CYP) belonging to the CYP153A family from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 produced a great amount of 1-octanol (2,250 mg per liter) from n-octane after 24 h of incubation. This level of production is equivalent to the maximum level previously achieved in biotransformation experiments of alkanes. In addition, the initial production rate of 1-octanol was maintained throughout the entire incubation period. These results indicate that we have achieved the functional and stable expression of a CYP in E. coli for the first time. Further, our biotransformation system showed alpha,omega-diterminal oxidation activity of n-alkanes, and a large amount of 1,8-octanediol (722 mg per liter) was produced from 1-octanol after 24 h of incubation. This is the first report on the bioproduction of alpha,omega-alkanediols from n-alkanes or 1-alkanols.
TI  - The Acinetobacter outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is a secreted emulsifier.
AB  - Acinetobacter strains use hydrophobic carbon sources and most of them are efficient oil degraders. They secrete a variety of emulsifiers which are efficient in producing and stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. The bioemulsifier of Acinetobacter radioresistens KA53 (Alasan) is a high-mass complex of proteins and polysaccharides. The major emulsification activity of this complex is associated with a 45 kDa protein (AlnA), which is homologous to the outer membrane protein OmpA. The emulsification ability of AlnA depends on the presence of hydrophobic residues in the four loops spanning the transmembrane domains. The finding of a secreted OmpA was unexpected, in view of the fact that this protein is essential in all Gram-negative bacteria, has four trans-membrane domains and is considered to be an integral structural component of the outer membrane. However, secretion of an OmpA with emulsifying ability could be of physiological importance in the utilization of hydrophobic substrates as carbon sources. Here we examined the possibility that secretion of OmpA with emulsifying activity is a general property of the oil-degrading Acinetobacter strains. The results indicate that OmpA is secreted in five strains of Acinetobacter, including strain Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 whose genome has been sequenced. The ompA genes of ADP1 and an additional strain, Acinetobacter sp. V-26 were cloned and sequenced. Structure analysis of the sequence of the two proteins indicated the existence of the hydrophobic regions, previously shown to be responsible for the emulsification activity of AlnA. Further examination of the recombinant OmpA proteins indicated that they are, indeed, strong emulsifiers, even when produced in Escherichia coli. The finding that Acinetobacter OmpA has emulsifying activity and that it is secreted in five strains of Acinetobacter may be physiologically significant and suggests the involvement of this protein in biodegradation of hydrophobic substrates, including hydrocarbons.
TI  - Antibiogram pattern of isolates from UTI cases in Eastern part of Nepal.
AB  - The present study was conducted to study antibiogram pattern of isolates from urinary tract infection (UTI) cases at a referral hospital in Eastern Nepal. Of the total 2,799 of urine samples studied, 720 (25.7%) were positive for some kinds of bacterial agents. Escherichia coli was most predominant organism (59.0%) followed by Klebsiella sp. (12.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%), Acinetobacter sp. (5.9%), Enterococcus sp. (4.2%) and others (2.6%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method following National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Services (NCCLS) guidelines. Most strains of Esch. coli and Klebsiella sp. were resistant to Ampicillin and Ciprofloxacin. Ps. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. showed relatively higher resistance to Aminoglycosides. These organisms were often multidrug resistant. Ps. aeruginosa showed 68.0% resistance to even Ceftazidime. For Enterococcus sp. Nitrofurantion and Gentamicin were the drugs of choice. Of the all antimicrobial agents tested, Ciprofloxacin showed most disappointing result.
TI  - The thin pili of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 mediate adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces.
AB  - Two structurally different appendages, thin and thick pili, are found in members  of the genus Acinetobacter. The presence of pilus structures correlates with different phenotypes, such as adherence to surfaces, a trait not only observed in pathogenic Acinetobacter species, as well as motility. However, their distinct individual roles were unknown. To characterize the role of different pili in the physiology of Acinetobacter, we isolated the thin pili from the cell surface of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 (recently recognized as representative of Acinetobacter baylyi), a soil bacterium that rapidly takes up naked DNA from its environment. Electron microscopy revealed that the pilus has an external diameter of 2 to 3 nm for single filaments. The filaments are packed into right-handed bundles. The major protein constituting the pilus was purified, and the encoding gene, acuA, was cloned. AcuA was found to be weakly related to the structural subunit of F17 pili of Escherichia coli. Analyses of the acuA flanking DNA region led to the identification of three closely associated genes, acuD, acuC, and acuG, whose deduced proteins are similar to chaperone, usher, and adhesin of F17-related pili, respectively. Transcriptional analyses revealed that acuA expression is maximal in the late-stationary-growth phase. Mutation of acuA led to a loss of thin pili and concomitantly loss of adhesion to polystyrene and erythrocytes but not loss of competence. Therefore, thin pili of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 are suggested to be assembled by the chaperone/usher pathway and are involved in adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces.
TI  - Two acyl-CoA dehydrogenases of Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1 that uses very long-chain n-alkanes.
AB  - Two genes encoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, acdA and acdB, arranged in tandem, were found in the chromosomal DNA of Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1. AcdA was purified from the parental strain and AcdB was purified from an Escherichia coli strain expressing the cloned gene. The substrate specificities of the two enzymes suggest that AcdA is a medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and that AcdB is a long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Characterization of n-alkane metabolism in Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1 has revealed parallel pathways as well as enzymes with overlapping specificities in a single pathway. The two acyl-CoA dehydrogenases described here provide another example of the physiological complexity underlying n-alkane utilization.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the estA gene encoding enzyme for producing (R)-beta-acetylmercaptoisobutyric acid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1001.
AB  - The estA gene encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the production of (R)-beta-acetylmercaptoisobutyric acid from (R,S)-ester from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1001, was cloned in Escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence was determined, revealing the presumed open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 316 amino acid residues (948 nucleotides). The overall A + T and C + G compositions were 32.59% and 67.41%, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the estA gene product showed a significant similarity with that of the triacylglycerol lipase from Psychrobacter immobilis (38% identity), triacylglycerol lipase from Moraxella sp. (36% identity), and two forms of carboxyl esterases from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (17% and 17% identities). The deduced amino acid sequences have a pentapeptide consensus sequence, G-X-S-X-G, having an active serine residue, and another active site, dipeptides H-G, located at 70-100 amino acids upstream of the G-X-S-X-G consensus sequence.
TI  - Simultaneous biocatalyst production and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation for bioconversion of cyclohexanone by recombinant Escherichia coli expressing cyclohexanone monooxygenase.
AB  - Cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) catalyzing Baeyer-Villiger oxidation converts  cyclic ketones into optically pure lactones, which have been used as building blocks in organic synthesis. A recombinant Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pMM4 expressing CHMO originated from Acinetobacter sp. NCIB 9871 was used to produce epsilon-caprolactone through a simultaneous biocatalyst production and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation (SPO) process. A fed-batch process was designed to obtain high cell density for improving production of epsilon-caprolactone. The fed-batch SPO process gave the best results, 10.2 g/L of epsilon-caprolactone and 0.34 g/(L.h) of productivity, corresponding to a 10.5- and 3.4-fold enhancement compared with those of the batch SPO, respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of adherence, hemagglutination, and presence of genes codifying for virulence factors of Acinetobacter baumannii causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a strictly aerobic bacterium which causes severe infections, however its pathogenic characteristics are not well defined. Thirteen A. baumannii strains isolated from urine of hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients with different ages were investigated for the presence of virulence factors. The isolates belonged to biotypes 2, 6, and 9 and were sensitive to imipenem. The majority of them showed resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. None of A. baumannii strains presented genes codifying for 17 different virulence factors previously described in uropathogenic Escherichia coli, when tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nine isolates agglutinated human group AB erythrocytes, in presence of mannose, but none of them agglutinated group O erythrocytes. Adherence to polystyrene was observed in 7 isolates, and this result did not correlate with that obtained in hemagglutination assay. All the isolates were able to grow in iron-limiting conditions, showing that A. baumannii produces some type of siderophore. However, the genes iutA and fyuA, from iron uptake system of E. coli and Yersinia sp., respectively, were not present in the isolates, suggesting the presence of a different type of siderophore. The fimbriae of A. baumannii strains that mediates the adherence are possibly mannose-resistant, even though the mechanism of adherence to human epithelial cells still remains to be elucidated.
TI  - [Comparison of BACTEC and BacT/ALERT systems in evaluation of blood cultures].
AB  - Automatized blood culture systems are used widely due to the characteristics such as lower contamination risks, shorter incubation periods and higher isolation rates. In this study, BACTEC 9050 (Becton Dickinson, Ireland) and BacT/ALERT 120 (Organon Teknika Corp, USA) systems were compared for the evaluation of blood cultures obtained from 222 hospitalized patients in intensive care units between September and December 2003. For this purpose, two blood samples obtained from each arms of patients, were inoculated into BACTEC plus aerobic/F (Becton Dickinson, Ireland) and BacT/ALERT FA/aerobic (BioMerieux, USA) media, respectively, and incubated. The first bacterial growth time has been recorded for each system and the bacteria were identified by conventional methods. As a result, both of the systems detected bacterial growth in 42 (91.3%) of a total of 46 (20.7%) positive blood samples obtained from 222 patients. The distribution of microorganisms grown in BACTEC and BacT/ALERT were found as follows, respectively; 24 and 20 coagulase negative staphylococci, 8 and 8 Acinetobacter sp., 6 and 10 Escherichia coli, 1 and 1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 and 1 Pseudomonas sp., 1 and 1 Klebsiella sp., 1 and 1 Candida sp. False positivity and false negativity were not observed in either of the systems. Positive results were obtained in an average time of 20.6 (7.5-35.5) hours and 22.49 (1.5-35.5) hours with BACTEC and BacT/ALERT, respectively. Since there was no statistically significant difference between the systems concerning bacterial isolation rates and periods (p=1.00), it may be concluded that both of these systems would be used in clinical microbiology laboratories for the evaluation of blood cultures.
TI  - [Distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou. METHODS: From July 2001 to August 2003, the resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard Kirby-Bauer method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2000). WHONET-5 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were Escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). The total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). The prevalences of ESBLs-producing strains in the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Proteus SP. in Guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. According to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by Cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). Imipenem was the most effective agents against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., and Proteus SP. isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-ESBLs-producing strains (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in Guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. An unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. Imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in Guangzhou.
TI  - Thio wax ester biosynthesis utilizing the unspecific bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - The bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA):diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 (formerly Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1) mediating the biosyntheses of wax esters and triacylglycerols was used for the in vivo and in vitro biosynthesis of thio wax esters and dithio wax esters. For in vitro biosynthesis, 5'His(6)WS/DGAT comprising an N-terminal His(6) tag was purified from the soluble protein fraction of Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (pET23a::5'His(6)atf). By employing SP-Sepharose high-pressure and Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid fast-protein liquid chromatographies, a 19-fold enrichment with a final specific activity of 165.2 nmol mg of protein(-1) min(-1) was achieved by using 1-hexadecanol and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates. Incubation of purified 5'His(6)WS/DGAT with 1-hexadecanethiol and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates resulted in the formation of palmitic acid hexadecyl thio ester (10.4% relative specific activity of a 1-hexadecanol control). Utilization of 1,8-octanedithiol and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates led to the formation of 1-S-monopalmitoyloctanedithiol and minor amounts of 1,8-S-dipalmitoyloctanedithiol (59.3% relative specific activity of a 1-hexadecanol control). The latter dithio wax ester was efficiently produced when 1-S-monopalmitoyloctanedithiol and palmitoyl-CoA were used as substrates (13.4% specific activity relative to that of a 1-hexadecanol control). For the in vivo biosynthesis of thio wax esters, the knockout mutant Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1acr1OmegaKm, which is unable to produce fatty alcohols, was used. Cultivation of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1acr1OmegaKm in the presence of gluconate, 1-hexadecanethiol, and oleic acid in nitrogen-limited mineral salts medium resulted in the accumulation of unusual thio wax esters that accounted for around 1.19% (wt/wt) of the cellular dry weight and consisted mainly of oleic acid hexadecyl thioester as revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
TI  - The wax ester synthase/acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1: characterization of a novel type of acyltransferase.
AB  - The wax ester synthase/acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA):diacylglycerol acyltransferase  (WS/DGAT) catalyzes the final steps in triacylglycerol (TAG) and wax ester (WE) biosynthesis in the gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. It constitutes a novel class of acyltransferases which is fundamentally different from acyltransferases involved in TAG and WE synthesis in eukaryotes. The enzyme was purified by a three-step purification protocol to apparent homogeneity from the soluble fraction of recombinant Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS (pET23a::atfA). Purified WS/DGAT revealed a remarkably low substrate specificity, accepting a broad range of various substances as alternative acceptor molecules. Besides having DGAT and WS activity, the enzyme possesses acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) activity. The sn-1 and sn-3 positions of acylglycerols are accepted with higher specificity than the sn-2 position. Linear alcohols ranging from ethanol to triacontanol are efficiently acylated by the enzyme, which exhibits highest specificities towards medium-chain-length alcohols. The acylation of cyclic and aromatic alcohols, such as cyclohexanol or phenylethanol, further underlines the unspecific character of this enzyme. The broad range of possible substrates may lead to biotechnological production of interesting wax ester derivatives. Determination of the native molecular weight revealed organization as a homodimer. The large number of WS/DGAT-homologous genes identified in pathogenic mycobacteria and their possible importance for the pathogenesis and latency of these bacteria makes the purified WS/DGAT from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 a valuable model for studying this group of proteins in pathogenic mycobacteria.
TI  - New antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. Management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. METHODS: This paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition. RESULTS: Patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. Several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against MRSA, VRE, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI) and intra-abdominal infections. Oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for cSSSI due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. Many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. Tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. Five University Clinics and/or Regional Hospitals in the Slovak Republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (13.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter sp. All CONS and S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the CONS and only for 4% of S. aureus isolates. A higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in CONS in comparison to S. aureus. Enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against E. coli. Although 17% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against K. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Toxicity caused by hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A thioester accumulation in mutants  of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - Hydroxycinnamates, aromatic compounds that play diverse roles in plants, are dissimilated by enzymes encoded by the hca genes in the nutritionally versatile, naturally transformable bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. A key step in the hca-encoded pathway is activation of the natural substrates caffeate, p-coumarate, and ferulate by an acyl:coenzyme A (acyl:CoA) ligase encoded by hcaC. As described in this paper, Acinetobacter cells with a knockout of the next enzyme in the pathway, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase (HcaA), are extremely sensitive to the presence of the three natural hydroxycinnamate substrates; Escherichia coli cells carrying a subclone with the hcaC gene are hydroxycinnamate sensitive as well. When the hcaA mutation was combined with a mutation in the repressor HcaR, exposure of the doubly mutated Acinetobacter cells to caffeate, p-coumarate, or ferulate at 10(-6) M totally inhibited the growth of cells. The toxicity of p-coumarate and ferulate to a DeltahcaA strain was found to be a bacteriostatic effect. Although not toxic to wild-type cells initially, the diphenolic caffeate was itself converted to a toxin over time in the absence of cells; the converted toxin was bactericidal. In an Acinetobacter strain blocked in hcaA, a secondary mutation in the ligase (HcaC) suppresses the toxic effect. Analysis of suppression due to the mutation of hcaC led to the development of a positive-selection strategy that targets mutations blocking HcaC. An hcaC mutation from one isolate was characterized and was found to result in the substitution of an amino acid that is conserved in a functionally characterized homolog of HcaC.
TI  - Temporary catheter infections in hemodialysis patients: results from a single center in Turkey.
AB  - In this study, we aimed to determine the frequencies of catheter exit-site infection (CESI), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) and catheter colonization (CC); causative microorganisms; and resistance patterns in patients with temporary hemodialysis catheters. From March 1999 to March 2000, 67 hemodialysis patients (38 males, 29 females; median age: 52, range: 17-84) were evaluated. The CDC criteria were used to diagnose CESI, CR-BSI and CC. The tips of catheters were cultured by Maki's method. At the same time, two different blood cultures, one from peripheral vein and the other through the catheter lumen were drawn. Swab cultures from the catheter exit sites were also performed. The isolation and identification of bacteria were performed by conventional methods and the susceptibility testing by the Kirby-Bauer method. CESI, CR-BSI and CC were found in, respectively, 20 (29.8%), 16 (23.8%) and 11 (16.4%) patients. The etiologic agents in CR-BSI were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (5), coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), Enterococcus sp. (1), Escherichia coli (1), Acinetobacter sp. (1) and Proteus sp. (1). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were found in proportions of 45.5% and 63.6% in CESI and CR-BSI+CC. The only risk factor for the development of CR-BSI and CC was intravenous drug use. In our center, the majority of CESI, CR-BSI and CC were due to staphylococci and there was a high rate of methicillin resistance.
TI  - Assessing the substrate selectivities and enantioselectivities of eight novel Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases toward alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones.
AB  - Genes encoding eight Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases have recently been cloned from bacteria inhabiting a wastewater treatment plant. We have carried out a systematic investigation in which each newly cloned enzyme, as well as the cyclohexanone monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. NCIB 9871, was used to oxidize 15 different alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones. The panel of substrates included equal numbers of 2-, 3-, and 4-alkyl-substituted compounds to probe each enzyme's stereoselectivity toward a homologous series of synthetically important compounds. For all 4-alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones tested, enzymes were discovered that afforded each of the corresponding (S)-lactones in >/=98% ee. This was also true for the 2-alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones examined. The situation was more complex for 3-akyl-substituted cyclohexanones. In a few cases, single Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases possessed both high regio- and enantioselectivities toward these compounds. More commonly, however, they showed only one type of selectivity. Nonetheless, enzymes with such properties might be useful as parts of a two-step bioprocess where an initial kinetic resolution is followed by a regioselective oxidation on the isolated, optically pure ketone.
TI  - Characterization and regulation of the genes for a novel anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia DBO1.
AB  - Anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) is an important intermediate in tryptophan metabolism. In order to investigate the degradation of tryptophan through anthranilate by Burkholderia cepacia, several plasposon mutations were constructed of strain DBO1 and one mutant with the plasposon insertion in the anthranilate dioxygenase (AntDO) genes was chosen for further study. The gene sequence obtained from flanking DNA of the plasposon insertion site revealed unexpected information. B. cepacia DBO1 AntDO (designated AntDO-3C) is a three-component Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] dioxygenase composed of a reductase (AndAa), a ferredoxin (AndAb), and a two-subunit oxygenase (AndAcAd). This is in contrast to the two-component (an oxygenase and a reductase) AntDO enzyme from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and P. putida P111. AntDO from strains ADP1, PAO1, and P111 are closely related to benzoate dioxygenase, while AntDO-3C is closely related to aromatic hydrocarbon dioxygenases from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans F199 and Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1 and 2-chlorobenzoate dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa strains 142 and JB2. Escherichia coli cells expressing the functional AntDO-3C genes transform anthranilate and salicylate (but not 2-chlorobenzoate) to catechol. The enzyme includes a novel reductase whose absence results in less efficient transformation of anthranilate by the oxygenase and ferredoxin. AndR, a possible AraC/XylS-type transcriptional regulator, was shown to positively regulate expression of the andAcAdAbAa genes. Anthranilate was the only effector (of 12 aromatic compounds tested) that was able to induce expression of the genes.
TI  - Hydroxycinnamate (hca) catabolic genes from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 are repressed by HcaR and are induced by hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A thioesters.
AB  - Hydroxycinnamates are plant products catabolized through the diphenol protocatechuate in the naturally transformable bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. Genes for protocatechuate catabolism are central to the dca-pca-qui-pob-hca chromosomal island, for which gene designations corresponding to catabolic function are dca (dicarboxylic acid), pca (protocatechuate), qui (quinate), pob (p-hydroxybenzoate), and hca (hydroxycinnamate). Acinetobacter hcaC had been cloned and shown to encode a hydroxycinnamate:coenzyme A (CoA) SH ligase that acts upon caffeate, p-coumarate, and ferulate, but genes for conversion of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA to protocatechuate had not been characterized. In this investigation, DNA from pobS to an XbaI site 5.3 kb beyond hcaC was captured in the plasmid pZR8200 by a strategy that involved in vivo integration of a cloning vector near the hca region of the chromosome. pZR8200 enabled Escherichia coli to convert p-coumarate to protocatechuate in vivo. Sequence analysis of the newly cloned DNA identified five open reading frames designated hcaA, hcaB, hcaK, hcaR, and ORF1. An Acinetobacter strain with a knockout of HcaA, a homolog of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyases, was unable to grow at the expense of hydroxycinnamates, whereas a strain mutated in HcaB, homologous to aldehyde dehydrogenases, grew poorly with ferulate and caffeate but well with p-coumarate. A chromosomal fusion of lacZ to the hcaE gene was used to monitor expression of the hcaABCDE promoter. LacZ was induced over 100-fold by growth in the presence of caffeate, p-coumarate, or ferulate. The protein deduced to be encoded by hcaR shares 28% identity with the aligned E. coli repressor, MarR. A knockout of hcaR produced a constitutive phenotype, as assessed in the hcaE::lacZ-Km(r) genetic background, revealing HcaR to be a repressor as well. Expression of hcaE::lacZ in strains with knockouts in hcaA, hcaB, or hcaC revealed unambiguously that hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesters relieve repression of the hcaABCDE genes by HcaR.
TI  - Consortium of fold-catalyzing proteins increases soluble expression of cyclohexanone monooxygenase in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cyclohexanone monooxygenase ( CHMO) gene of Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 9871 was  simultaneously expressed with the genes encoding molecular chaperones and foldases in Escherichia coli. While the expression of the CHMO gene alone resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies, coexpression of the chaperone or foldase genes remarkably increased the production of soluble CHMO enzyme in recombinant E. coli. Furthermore, it was found that molecular chaperones were more beneficial than foldases for enhancing active CHMO enzyme production. The recombinant E. coli strain simultaneously expressing the genes for CHMO, GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE showed a specific CHMO activity of 111 units g(-1) cell protein, corresponding to a 38-fold enhancement in CHMO activity compared with the control E. coli strain expressing the CHMO gene alone.
TI  - Indigo production by Escherichia coli carrying the phenol hydroxylase gene from Acinetobacter sp strain ST-550 in a water-organic solvent two-phase system.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain ST-550 produces indigo from indole in the presence of a  large volume of diphenylmethane and a high level of indole. Particular proteins increased remarkably in strain ST-550 grown in the two-phase culture system for indigo production. One of the proteins showed a N-terminal amino acid sequence that was identical to that of the largest subunit of phenol hydroxylase (MopN) from A. calcoaceticus NCBI8250. The indigo-producing activity was strongly induced when ST-550 was grown with phenol as a sole carbon source. Genes coding for the multicomponent phenol hydroxylase were cloned, based on the homology with mopKLMOP from A. calcoaceticus NCBI8250. Escherichia coli carrying the genes produced indigo from indole. E. coli JA300 and its cyclohexane-resistant mutant, OST3410, carrying the hydroxylase genes and the NADH regeneration system were grown in the two-phase culture system for indigo production. The OST3410 recombinant produced 52 microg indigo ml(-1) of medium in the presence of diphenylmethane. This productivity was 4.3-fold higher than that of the JA300 recombinant.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster involved in cyclopentanol metabolism in Comamonas sp. strain NCIMB 9872 and biotransformations effected by Escherichia coli-expressed cyclopentanone 1,2-monooxygenase.
AB  - Cyclopentanone 1,2-monooxygenase, a flavoprotein produced by Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIMB 9872 upon induction by cyclopentanol or cyclopentanone (M. Griffin and P. W. Trudgill, Biochem. J. 129:595-603, 1972), has been utilized as a biocatalyst in Baeyer-Villiger oxidations. To further explore this biocatalytic potential and to discover new genes, we have cloned and sequenced a 16-kb chromosomal locus of strain 9872 that is herein reclassified as belonging to the genus COMAMONAS: Sequence analysis revealed a cluster of genes and six potential open reading frames designated and grouped in at least four possible transcriptional units as (orf11-orf10-orf9)-(cpnE-cpnD-orf6-cpnC)-(cpnR-cpnB-cpnA)-(orf3-orf4 [partial 3' end]). The cpnABCDE genes encode enzymes for the five-step conversion of cyclopentanol to glutaric acid catalyzed by cyclopentanol dehydrogenase, cyclopentanone 1,2-monooxygenase, a ring-opening 5-valerolactone hydrolase, 5-hydroxyvalerate dehydrogenase, and 5-oxovalerate dehydrogenase, respectively. Inactivation of cpnB by using a lacZ-Km(r) cassette resulted in a strain that was not capable of growth on cyclopentanol or cyclopentanone as a sole carbon and energy source. The presence of sigma(54)-dependent regulatory elements in front of the divergently transcribed cpnB and cpnC genes supports the notion that cpnR is a regulatory gene of the NtrC type. Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the cpn genes was used to construct isopropyl-beta-thio-D-galactoside-inducible clones of Escherichia coli cells that overproduce the five enzymes of the cpn pathway. The substrate specificities of CpnA and CpnB were studied in particular to evaluate the potential of these enzymes and establish the latter recombinant strain as a bioreagent for Baeyer-Villiger oxidations. Although frequently nonenantioselective, cyclopentanone 1,2-monooxygenase was found to exhibit a broader substrate range than the related cyclohexanone 1,2-monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain NCIMB 9871. However, in a few cases opposite enantioselectivity was observed between the two biocatalysts.
TI  - Primary structure and catalytic properties of a cold-active esterase from a psychrotroph, Acinetobacter sp. strain No. 6. isolated from Siberian soil.
AB  - We cloned a gene coding for a cold-active esterase from a genomic library of Acinetobacter sp. strain No. 6, a psychrotroph isolated from Siberian soil. The gene, aest, encoded a protein of 301 amino acid residues, the deduced sequence of which had less than 17% identity to sequences of known esterases and lipases. However, the esterase seemed to belong to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily, because it contained a sequence, Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly (with Xaa an arbitrary amino acid residue), found in most serine hydrolases of this superfamily. Sequence comparison earlier suggested a weak phylogenetic relationship of gene product AEST to the EST group of the esterase-lipase family, which has been found only in eukaryotes. The aest gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells under the control of the T7 promoter, and the expression product was purified to homogeneity and characterized. It catalyzed the hydrolysis of esters with short-chain acyl groups and had lower activation energy and lower thermostability than do mesophilic enzymes, as expected from the cold-adapted nature of this enzyme.
TI  - Bacterial flora in foals with upper respiratory tract infections in Poland.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from nasal cavity of 80 foals with upper respiratory tract infection, as well as from 20 healthy foals, were examined. Within the group of sick animals, from 18 (22.5%) bacteria with recognized pathogenicity were isolated. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Acinetobacter sp. were the dominant species identified (100 and 45%, respectively). No bacteria species with recognized pathogenicity were isolated from the group of healthy animals. Three cases of death within the group of sick foals were investigated. Rhodococcus equi in two cases and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae together with Escherichia coli were isolated post-mortem from lung abscesses.
TI  - Plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  - During evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not cause an efficient gene expression. However, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) in bacteria. We therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. Accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from Solanum tuberosum, Nicotiana tabacum, CaMV, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and A. rhizogenes for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, A. tumefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter sp. BD413). To monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from Vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence in the bacteria. Heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. We then mapped the transcription start site caused by one of the plant-specific promoters, the ST-LS1 promoter from S. tuberosum, in these bacterial species. The location of the mapped transcription start site indicated that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. The recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial RNA polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the ST-LS1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in E. coli. Using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the ST-LS1 promoter serving as -10 region in E. coli. The results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. This is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.
TI  - Synergistic transcriptional activation by one regulatory protein in response to two metabolites.
AB  - BenM is a LysR-type bacterial transcriptional regulator that controls aromatic compound degradation in Acinetobacter sp. ADP1. Here, in vitro transcription assays demonstrated that two metabolites of aromatic compound catabolism, benzoate and cis,cis-muconate, act synergistically to activate gene expression. The level of BenM-regulated benA transcription was significantly higher in response to both compounds than the combined levels due to each alone. These compounds also were more effective together than they were individually in altering the DNase I footprint patterns of BenM-DNA complexes. This type of dual-inducer synergy provides great potential for rapid and large modulations of gene expression and may represent an important, and possibly widespread, feature of transcriptional control.
TI  - Evaluation of non-cyanobacterial genome sequences for occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to cyanophycin synthetase and cloning of an active cyanophycin synthetase from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587.
AB  - All publicly accessible microbial genome databases were searched for the occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to the cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 in order to reveal the capability of microorganisms not belonging to the cyanobacteria to synthesize cyanophycin. Among 65 genome sequences, genes homologous to cphA were found in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 (encoding a protein homologous to CphA with 40% amino acid identity), Bordetella bronchiseptica strain RB50 (39%), Bordetella pertussis strain Tohama I (39%), Bordetella parapertussis strain 12822 (39%), Clostridium botulinum strain ATCC 3502 (39%), Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain DCB-2 (38%) and Nitrosomonas europaea strain ATCC 25978 (37%). The gene homologous to cphA from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 was amplified by PCR, ligated to the vector pBluescript SK(-) downstream of the lac promoter and introduced into Escherichia coli. The recombinant strain of E. coli expressed CphA activity at up to 1.2 U/mg protein and accumulated cyanophycin to up to 7.5% of the cellular dry matter, indicating that CphA of Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 is functionally active. In Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 itself, cyanophycin accumulated to up to 1.4% of the total protein under phosphate-limited conditions, and cyanophycin synthetase activity was detected, which indicated the function of cyanophycin as a storage compound in this strain.
TI  - An efficient enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation by engineered Escherichia coli cells under non-growing conditions.
AB  - Economical methods of supplying NADPH must be developed before biotransformations involving this cofactor can be considered for large-scale applications. We have studied the enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone as a model for this class of reactions and developed a simple approach that uses whole, non-growing Escherichia coli cells to provide high productivity (0.79 g epsilon-caprolactone/L/h = 18 micromol epsilon-caprolactone/min/g dcw) and an 88% yield. Glucose supplied the reducing equivalents for this process, and no exogenous cofactor was required. The volumetric productivity of non-growing cells was an order of magnitude greater than that achieved with growing cells of the same strain. Cells of an engineered E. coli strain that overexpresses Acinetobacter sp. cyclohexanone monooxygenase were grown under inducing conditions in rich medium until the entry to stationary phase; the subsequent cyclohexanone oxidation was carried out in minimal salts medium lacking a nitrogen source. After the biotransformation was complete, the lactone product was adsorbed to a solid support and recovered by washing with an organic solvent.
TI  - Differential DNA binding of transcriptional regulator PcaU from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - Transcriptional regulator PcaU from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 governs expression of genes for protocatechuate degradation (pca genes) as a repressor or an activator depending on the levels of the inducer protocatechuate and of its own gene. PcaU is a member of the IclR protein family. Here the DNA binding properties of the purified protein are described in terms of the location of the binding sites and the affinity to these sites. Native PcaU was purified after overexpression of the pcaU gene in Escherichia coli. It is a dimer in solution. The binding site in the pcaU-pcaI intergenic region is located between the two divergent promoters covering 45 bp, which includes three perfect 10-bp repetitions. A PcaU binding site downstream of pcaU is covered by PcaU across two palindromic sequence repetitions. The affinity of PcaU for the intergenic binding sites is 50-fold higher (dissociation constant [K(d)], 0.16 nM) than the affinity for the site downstream of pcaU (K(d), 8 nM). The binding of PcaU was tested after modifications of the intergenic binding site. Removal of any external sequence repetition still allowed for specific binding of PcaU, but the affinity was significantly reduced, suggesting an important role for all three sequence repetitions in gene expression. The involvement of DNA bending in the regulatory process is suggested by the observed strong intrinsic curvature displayed by the pcaU-pcaI intergenic DNA.
TI  - Functional analysis of alkane hydroxylases from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have cloned homologs of the Pseudomonas putida GPo1 alkane hydroxylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, Alcanivorax borkumensis AP1, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and Prauserella rugosa NRRL B-2295. Sequence comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the homologs is as low as 35%, and that the Pseudomonas alkane hydroxylases are as distantly related to each other as to the remaining alkane hydroxylases. Based on the observation that rubredoxin, an electron transfer component of the GPo1 alkane hydroxylase system, can be replaced by rubredoxins from other alkane hydroxylase systems, we have developed three recombinant host strains for the functional analysis of the novel alkane hydroxylase genes. Two hosts, Escherichia coli GEc137 and P. putida GPo12, were equipped with pGEc47 Delta B, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on medium-chain-length alkanes (C(6) to C(12)), except a functional alkane hydroxylase. The third host was an alkB knockout derivative of P. fluorescens CHA0, which is no longer able to grow on C(12) to C(16) alkanes. All alkane hydroxylase homologs, except the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 AlkM, allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on n-alkanes.
TI  - Functions of the mismatch repair gene mutS from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - The genus Acinetobacter encompasses a heterogeneous group of bacteria that are ubiquitous in the natural environment due in part to their ability to adapt genetically to novel challenges. Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 (also known as strain BD413) is naturally transformable and takes up DNA from any source. Donor DNA can be integrated into the chromosome by recombination provided it possesses sufficient levels of nucleotide sequence identity to the recipient's DNA. In other bacteria, the requirement for sequence identity during recombination is partly due to the actions of the mismatch repair system, a key component of which, MutS, recognizes mismatched bases in heteroduplex DNA and, along with MutL, blocks strand exchange. We have cloned mutS from strain ADP1 and examined its roles in preventing recombination between divergent DNA and in the repair of spontaneous replication errors. Inactivation of mutS resulted in 3- to 17-fold increases in transformation efficiencies with donor sequences that were 8 to 20% divergent relative to the strain ADP1. Strains lacking MutS exhibited increased spontaneous mutation frequencies, and reversion assays demonstrated that MutS preferentially recognized transition mismatches while having little effect on the repair of transversion mismatches. Inactivation of mutS also abolished the marker-specific variations in transforming efficiency seen in mutS(+) recipients where transition and frameshift alleles transformed at eightfold lower frequencies than transversions or large deletions. Comparison of the MutS homologs from five individual Acinetobacter strains with those of other gram-negative bacteria revealed that a number of unique indels are conserved among the Acinetobacter amino acid sequences.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel gene encoding L-ribose isomerase from Acinetobacter sp. strain DL-28 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding a novel L-ribose isomerase (L-RI) from Acinetobacter sp. was cloned into Escherichia coli and nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene corresponded to an open reading frame of 747 bp that codes for a deduced protein of 249 amino acids, which showed no amino acid sequence similarity with any other sugar isomerases. After expression of the gene in E. coli using pUC118 the recombinant L-RI was purified to homogeneity using different chromatographic methods. The overall enzymatic properties of the purified recombinant L-RI were the same as those of the authentic L-RI. To our knowledge, this is the first time report concerning the L-RI gene.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of benzoate catabolic genes in the gram-positive polychlorinated biphenyl degrader Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1.
AB  - Benzoate catabolism is thought to play a key role in aerobic bacterial degradation of biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Benzoate catabolic genes were cloned from a PCB degrader, Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1, by using PCR amplification and temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis separation. A nucleotide sequence determination revealed that the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the RHA1 benzoate catabolic genes, benABCDK, exhibit 33 to 65% identity with those of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. The gene organization of the RHA1 benABCDK genes differs from that of ADP1. The RHA1 benABCDK region was localized on the chromosome, in contrast to the biphenyl catabolic genes, which are located on linear plasmids. Escherichia coli cells containing RHA1 benABCD transformed benzoate to catechol via 2-hydro-1,2-dihydroxybenzoate. They transformed neither 2- nor 4-chlorobenzoates but did transform 3-chlorobenzoate. The RHA1 benA gene was inactivated by insertion of a thiostrepton resistance gene. The resultant mutant strain, RBD169, neither grew on benzoate nor transformed benzoate, and it did not transform 3-chlorobenzoate. It did, however, exhibit diminished growth on biphenyl and growth repression in the presence of a high concentration of biphenyl (13 mM). These results indicate that the cloned benABCD genes could play an essential role not only in benzoate catabolism but also in biphenyl catabolism in RHA1. Six rhodococcal benzoate degraders were found to have homologs of RHA1 benABC. In contrast, two rhodococcal strains that cannot transform benzoate were found not to have RHA1 benABC homologs, suggesting that many Rhodococcus strains contain benzoate catabolic genes similar to RHA1 benABC.
TI  - Cloning and genetic characterization of dca genes required for beta-oxidation of  straight-chain dicarboxylic acids in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - A previous study of deletions in the protocatechuate (pca) region of the Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 chromosome revealed that genes required for utilization of the six-carbon dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, are linked to the pca structural genes. To investigate the genes involved in adipate catabolism, a 33.8-kb SacI fragment, which corrects a deletion spanning this region, was cloned. In addition to containing known pca, qui, and pob genes (for protocatechuate, quinate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate dissimilation), clone pZR8000 contained 10 kb of DNA which was the subject of this investigation. A mutant strain of Escherichia coli DH5alpha, strain EDP1, was isolated that was able to utilize protocatechuate and 4-hydroxybenzoate as growth substrates when EDP1 cells contained pZR8000. Sequence analysis of the new region of DNA on pZR8000 revealed open reading frames predicted to be involved in beta-oxidation. Knockouts of three genes implicated in beta-oxidation steps were introduced into the chromosome of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. Each of the mutants was unable to grow with adipate. Because the mutants were affected in their ability to utilize additional saturated, straight-chain dicarboxylic acids, the newly discovered 10 kb of DNA was termed the dca (dicarboxylic acid) region. Mutant strains included one with a deletion in dcaA (encoding an acyl coenzyme A [acyl-CoA] dehydrogenase homolog), one with a deletion in dcaE (encoding an enoyl-CoA hydratase homolog), and one with a deletion in dcaH (encoding a hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase homolog). Data on the dca region should help us probe the functional significance and interrelationships of clustered genetic elements in this section of the Acinetobacter chromosome.
TI  - Expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. This process is attributed to enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The presence of Clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56 intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured Clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. Such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. METHODS: A total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. Of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. These 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D glucuronide as substrate. Results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. RESULTS: C. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for E coli, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus sp., and Klebsiella sp. CONCLUSION: C. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than E coli and Klebsiella sp.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) composition in recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  - A recombinant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (mutant in propionate-activation activity) was metabolically engineered to control the composition of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy- valerate) (PHBV), a polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer with commercially desirable properties. A gene (prpE) encoding propionyl-CoA synthetase was placed under the control of the IPTG-inducible taclacUV5 promoter (P(taclacUV5)) while the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis operon (phaBCA) from Acinetobacter sp. RA3849 was coexpressed under the control of the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter (P(BAD)). S. enterica, harboring both constructs, was grown in medium containing a fixed substrate concentration and the composition of the copolymer was varied between 2 mol% and 25 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate by controlling the IPTG level in the medium. This "dial-a-composition" system should find application in cases where the substrate concentration of a feedstream for PHBV bioplastic production is not adjustable.
TI  - Asymmetric Baeyer-Villiger oxidations of 4-mono- and 4,4-disubstituted cyclohexanones by whole cells of engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - Whole cells of an Escherichia coli strain that overexpresses Acinetobacter sp. NCIB 9871 cyclohexanone monooxygenase have been used for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidations of a variety of 4-mono- and 4,4-disubstituted cyclohexanones. In cases where comparisons were possible, this new biocatalytic reagent provided lactones with chemical yields and optical purities that were comparable to those obtained from the purified enzyme or a strain of bakers' yeast that expresses the same enzyme. The efficient production of cyclohexanone monooxygenase in the E. coli expression system (ca. 30% of total soluble protein) allowed these oxidations to reach completion in approximately half the time required for the engineered bakers' yeast strain. Surprisingly, 4,4-disubstituted cyclohexanones were also accepted by the enzyme, and the enantioselectivities of these oxidations could be rationalized by considering the conformational energies of bound substrates along with the enzyme's intrinsic enantioselectivity. The enzyme expressed in E. coli cells also oxidized several 4-substituted cyclohexanones bearing polar substituents, often with high enantioselectivities. In the case of 4-iodocyclohexanone, the lactone was obtained in > 98% ee and its absolute configuration was assigned by X-ray crystallography. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic P2(1) space group with a = 5.7400(10), b = 6.1650(10), c = 11.377(2) A, b = 99.98(2) degrees, and Z = 2. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of an engineered bacterial strain in delivering useful chiral building blocks in an experimentally simple manner.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in Belgium.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant (Ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two Belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. The study of Ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic Aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. In total, 354 independently obtained Ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by GLC analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), by API 20E profiling and/or by Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP) DNA fingerprinting. In general, Ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (Amp) tolerance compared to the Ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). FAME results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant Ot(r) Aeromonas strains over representatives of Acinetobacter and Escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. Among the Ot(r) mesophilic Aeromonas strain set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (Kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). To some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of Aeromonas caviae DNA hybridisation group (HG) 4. Collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for Amp and Kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable Ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. In addition, our identification data also revealed that Enterobacter sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and A. veronii biovar sobria HG8 may be considered potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.
TI  - Molecular screening for alkane hydroxylase genes in Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains.
AB  - We have developed highly degenerate oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genes related to the Pseudomonas oleovorans GPo1 and Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 alkane hydroxylases, based on a number of highly conserved sequence motifs. In all Gram-negative and in two out of three Gram-positive strains able to grow on medium- (C6-C11) or long-chain n-alkanes (C12-C16), PCR products of the expected size were obtained. The PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced and found to encode peptides with 43.2-93.8% sequence identity to the corresponding fragment of the P. oleovorans GPo1 alkane hydroxylase. Strains that were unable to grow on n-alkanes did not yield PCR products with homology to alkane hydroxylase genes. The alkane hydroxylase genes of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus EB104 and Pseudomonas putida P1 were cloned using the PCR products as probes. The two genes allow an alkane hydroxylase-negative mutant of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 and an Escherichia coli recombinant containing all P. oleovorans alk genes except alkB, respectively, to grow on n-alkanes, showing that the cloned genes do indeed encode alkane hydroxylases.
TI  - Significance of fever in Jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4 degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.
TI  - Characterization and evolution of anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - The two-component anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase of the bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. This enzyme converts anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) to catechol with insertion of both atoms of O(2) and consumption of one NADH. The terminal oxygenase component formed an alpha(3)beta(3) hexamer of 54- and 19-kDa subunits. Biochemical analyses demonstrated one Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] center and one mononuclear nonheme iron center in each large oxygenase subunit. The reductase component, which transfers electrons from NADH to the oxygenase component, was found to contain approximately one flavin adenine dinucleotide and one ferredoxin-type [2Fe-2S] center per 39-kDa monomer. Activities of the combined components were measured as rates and quantities of NADH oxidation, substrate disappearance, product appearance, and O(2) consumption. Anthranilate conversion to catechol was stoichiometrically coupled to NADH oxidation and O(2) consumption. The substrate analog benzoate was converted to a nonaromatic benzoate 1,2-diol with similarly tight coupling. This latter activity is identical to that of the related benzoate 1, 2-dioxygenase. A variant anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase, previously found to convey temperature sensitivity in vivo because of a methionine-to-lysine change in the large oxygenase subunit, was purified and characterized. The purified M43K variant, however, did not hydroxylate anthranilate or benzoate at either the permissive (23 degrees C) or nonpermissive (39 degrees C) growth temperatures. The wild-type anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase did not efficiently hydroxylate methylated or halogenated benzoates, despite its sequence similarity to broad-substrate specific dioxygenases that do. Phylogenetic trees of the alpha and beta subunits of these terminal dioxygenases that act on natural and xenobiotic substrates indicated that the subunits of each terminal oxygenase evolved from a common ancestral two-subunit component.
TI  - Thermostable NADP(+)-dependent medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1: purification and characterization and gene expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - NADPH-dependent alkylaldehyde reducing enzyme, which was greatly induced by n-hexadecane, from Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1 was purified and characterized. The purified enzyme had molecular masses of 40 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 160 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme, which was shown to be highly thermostable, was most active toward n-heptanal and could use n-alkylaldehydes ranging from C(2) to C(14) and several substituted benzaldehydes, including the industrially important compounds cinnamyl aldehyde and anisaldehyde, as substrates. The alrA gene coding for this enzyme was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the alrA gene exhibited homology to the amino acid sequences of zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases from various sources. The gene could be highly expressed in Escherichia coli, and the product was purified to homogeneity by simpler procedures from the recombinant than from the original host. Our results show that this enzyme can be used for industrial bioconversion of useful alcohols and aldehydes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam in comparison with other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  - Combining tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, with the ureidopenicillin, piperacillin, successfully restores the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing bacteria. Thus, piperacillin/tazobactam is highly active against most clinically important species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. We evaluated the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates from a tertiary university hospital located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Its activity was compared to that of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, aztreonam, and imipenem against 820 isolates (608 Gram-negative and 212 Gram-positive) collected from hospitalized patients in 1999. The most frequent species tested were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (168/20%), Escherichia coli (139/17%), Acinetobacter spp. (131/16%), and Staphylococcus aureus (76/9%). Of the isolates studied, 30% were from the bloodstream, 16% from the lower respiratory tract, and 11% from surgical wounds or soft tissue. The isolates were susceptibility tested by the broth microdilution method according to NCCLS procedures. The isolates tested were highly resistant to most antimicrobial agents evaluated. Imipenem resistance was not verified among Enterobacteriaceae, and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active beta-lactams against this group of bacteria (80.0% susceptibility). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was very high among E. coli (approximately 20%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (approximately 40%). Imipenem was uniformly active against these species (100% susceptibility) and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active compound inhibiting 84.4% of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly resistant to all beta-lactams evaluated and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active compound against this species. Our results demonstrate an extremely high level of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital evaluated, especially among non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli. Due to this high level of resistance, piperacillin/tazobactam represents an important contribution to the treatment of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Exogenous isolation of antibiotic resistance plasmids from piggery manure slurries reveals a high prevalence and diversity of IncQ-like plasmids.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance plasmids were exogenously isolated in biparental matings with piggery manure bacteria as plasmid donors in Escherichia coli CV601 and Pseudomonas putida UWC1 recipients. Surprisingly, IncQ-like plasmids were detected by dot blot hybridization with an IncQ oriV probe in several P. putida UWC1 transconjugants. The capture of IncQ-like plasmids in biparental matings indicates not only their high prevalence in manure slurries but also the presence of efficiently mobilizing plasmids. In order to elucidate unusual hybridization data (weak or no hybridization with IncQ repB or IncQ oriT probes) four IncQ-like plasmids (pIE1107, pIE1115, pIE1120, and pIE1130), each representing a different EcoRV restriction pattern, were selected for a more thorough plasmid characterization after transfer into E. coli K-12 strain DH5alpha by transformation. The characterization of the IncQ-like plasmids revealed an astonishingly high diversity with regard to phenotypic and genotypic properties. Four different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were found to be conferred by the IncQ-like plasmids. The plasmids could be mobilized by the RP4 derivative pTH10 into Acinetobacter sp., Ralstonia eutropha, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and P. putida, but they showed diverse patterns of stability under nonselective growth conditions in different host backgrounds. Incompatibility testing and PCR analysis clearly revealed at least two different types of IncQ-like plasmids. PCR amplification of total DNA extracted directly from different manure samples and other environments indicated the prevalence of both types of IncQ plasmids in manure, sewage, and farm soil. These findings suggest that IncQ plasmids play an important role in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Genetic analysis of a gene cluster for cyclohexanol oxidation in Acinetobacter sp. Strain SE19 by in vitro transposition.
AB  - Biological oxidation of cyclic alcohols normally results in formation of the corresponding dicarboxylic acids, which are further metabolized and enter the central carbon metabolism in the cell. We isolated an Acinetobacter sp. from an industrial wastewater bioreactor that utilized cyclohexanol as a sole carbon source. A cosmid library was constructed from Acinetobacter sp. strain SE19, and oxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid was demonstrated in recombinant Escherichia coli carrying a SE19 DNA segment. A region that was essential for cyclohexanol oxidation was localized to a 14-kb fragment on the cosmid DNA. Several putative open reading frames (ORFs) that were expected to encode enzymes catalyzing the conversion of cyclohexanol to adipic acid were identified. Whereas one ORF showed high homology to cyclohexanone monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain NCIB 9871, most of the ORFs showed only moderate homology to proteins in GenBank. In order to assign functions of the various ORFs, in vitro transposon mutagenesis was performed using the cosmid DNA as a target. A set of transposon mutants with a single insertion in each of the ORFs was screened for cyclohexanol oxidation in E. coli. Several of the transposon mutants accumulated a variety of cyclohexanol oxidation intermediates. The in vitro transposon mutagenesis technique was shown to be a powerful tool for rapidly assigning gene functions to all ORFs in the pathway.
TI  - Long-chain aldehyde dehydrogenase that participates in n-alkane utilization and wax ester synthesis in Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1.
AB  - A long-chain aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald1, was found in a soluble fraction of Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1 cells grown on n-hexadecane as a sole carbon source. The gene (ald1) was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of the bacterium. The open reading frame of ald1 was 1,512 bp long, corresponding to a protein of 503 amino acid residues (molecular mass, 55,496 Da), and the deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to those of various aldehyde dehydrogenases. The ald1 gene was stably expressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product (recombinant Ald1 [rAld1]) was purified to apparent homogeneity by gel electrophoresis. rAld1 showed enzyme activity toward n-alkanals (C(4) to C(14)), with a preference for longer carbon chains within the tested range; the highest activity was obtained with tetradecanal. The ald1 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination on the Acinetobacter genome. Although the ald1 disruptant (ald1Delta) strain still had the ability to grow on n-hexadecane to some extent, its aldehyde dehydrogenase activity toward n-tetradecanal was reduced to half the level of the wild-type strain. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, the accumulation of intracellular wax esters in the ald1Delta strain became much lower than that in the wild-type strain. These and other results imply that a soluble long-chain aldehyde dehydrogenase indeed plays important roles both in growth on n-alkane and in wax ester formation in Acinetobacter sp. strain M-1.
TI  - ComP, a pilin-like protein essential for natural competence in Acinetobacter sp.  Strain BD413: regulation, modification, and cellular localization.
AB  - We recently identified a pilin-like competence factor, ComP, which is essential for natural transformation of the gram-negative soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413. Here we demonstrate that transcription and synthesis of the pilin-like competence factor ComP are maximal in the late stationary growth phase, whereas competence is induced immediately after inoculation of a stationary-phase culture into fresh medium. Western blot analyses revealed three forms of ComP, one with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa, which correlates with the molecular mass deduced from the DNA sequence, one 20-kDa form, which was found to be glycosylated, and one 23-kDa form. The glycosylation of ComP was not required for its function in DNA binding and uptake. The 20-kDa form was present in the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane, whereas the 23-kDa form was located in the outer membrane and might be due to a further modification. Immunological data suggest that ComP is not a subunit of the pilus structures. Possible functions of ComP in the DNA transformation machinery of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 are discussed.
TI  - Neonatal gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  - A 22 months prospective study of neonatal gram-negative bacteremia was undertaken in a 15 bed NICU to find out the incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns. Clinically suspected 1326 cases of neonatal sepsis were studied during this period. More than 25% of the cases were microbiologically positive for sepsis. Among 230 (67.2%) cases of gram-negative bacteremia, the predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.4%), Escherichia coli (15.6%) and Acinetobacter sp. (7.8%). Fifty-nine per cent of the neonates were born in hospital while 41% were from community and referral cases. Lower respiratory tract infection, umbilical sepsis, central intravenous line infection and infection following invasive procedures were the most commonly identified sources of septicemia. Prematurity and low birth weight were the main underlying conditions in 60% of the neonates. Total mortality was 32%. Increased mortality was mainly associated with neutropenia, nosocomial infection and inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Resistance was increasingly noted against many antibiotics. The isolates were predominantly resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins (25%-75%), piperacillin (68%-78%), and gentamicin (23%-69%). The commonest microorganisms causing gram-negative bacteremia were Pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The community-acquired bacteremia was mainly due to E. coli. The proportion of preterm and low birth weight babies was significantly high, and the major contributing factor in total mortality. Sensitivity to different antibiotics conclusively proved that a combination of ampicillin + sulbactam with amikacin or ampicillin + sulbactam with ciprofloxacin is most effective.
TI  - comB, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. BD413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  - Here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging ORFs in Acinetobacter sp.  BD413, namely lytB, orfY, orfX, comB, and orfZ, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comC. The N-termini of the deduced proteins OrfY and ComB exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein ComB is similar to type IV pilins. LytB is similar to the Escherichia coli LytB, which has been implicated in the stringent response. No homologues of OrfX, OrfY and OrfZ could be identified. A mutation in orfY or orfZ led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comB resulted in a non-competent phenotype. Disruption of lytB did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. Complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comB is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfY and orfZ mutants were due to polar effects on comB and comC, respectively. Analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comB mutant suggested that the competence gene comB is not essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili and expression of the type IV pili-associated property of twitching motility. Transcriptional fusions between comB and a promoter-free lacZ gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comB during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.
TI  - sal genes determining the catabolism of salicylate esters are part of a supraoperonic cluster of catabolic genes in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - A 5-kbp region upstream of the are-ben-cat genes was cloned from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1, extending the supraoperonic cluster of catabolic genes to 30 kbp. Four open reading frames, salA, salR, salE, and salD, were identified from the nucleotide sequence. Reverse transcription-PCR studies suggested that these open reading frames are organized into two convergent transcription units, salAR and salDE. The salE gene, encoding a protein of 239 residues, was ligated into expression vector pET5a. Its product, SalE, was shown to have esterase activity against short-chain alkyl esters of 4-nitrophenol but was also able to hydrolyze ethyl salicylate to ethanol and salicylic acid. A mutant of ADP1 with a Km(r) cassette introduced into salE had lost the ability to utilize only ethyl and methyl salicylates of the esters tested as sole carbon sources, and no esterase activity against ethyl salicylate could be detected in cell extracts. SalE was induced during growth on ethyl salicylate but not during growth on salicylate itself. salD encoded a protein of undetermined function with homologies to the Escherichia coli FadL membrane protein, which is involved in facilitating fatty acid transport, and a number of other proteins detected during aromatic catabolism, which may also function in hydrocarbon transport or uptake processes. A Km(r) cassette insertion in salD deleteriously affected cell growth and viability. The salA and salR gene products closely resemble two Pseudomonas proteins, NahG and NahR, respectively encoding salicylate hydroxylase and the LysR family regulator of both salicylate and naphthalene catabolism. salA was cloned into pUC18 together with salR and salE, and its gene product showed salicylate-inducible hydroxylase activity against a range of substituted salicylates, with the same relative specific activities as found in wild-type ADP1 grown on salicylate. Mutations involving insertion of Km(r) cassettes into salA and salR eliminated expression of salicylate hydroxylase activity and the ability to grow on either salicylate or ethyl salicylate. Studies of mutants with disruptions of genes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway with or without an additional salE mutation confirmed that ethyl salicylate and salicylate were channeled into the beta-ketoadipate pathway at the level of catechol and thence dissimilated by the cat gene products. SalR appeared to regulate expression of salA but not salE.
TI  - Sub-MIC ciprofloxacin effect on fimbrial production by uropathogenic Escherichia  coli strains.
AB  - The urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (UTI) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Forty-nine bacterial samples of density 10(5) CFU/ml were not considered. From the resulting 161 samples, E. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. Other microoganisms found were: Enterococcus sp. (34 samples), Staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), Proteus sp. (11), Pseudomonas sp. (11), Klebsiella sp. (8), Enterobacter sp. (6), Citrobacter sp. (3), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). The uropathogenic E. coli strains found were P-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, SDS-PAGE of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All E. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 MIC). Our results showed that: 1) P-fimbriated E. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute UTI (34%); 2) exposure to sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production in 79% of E. coli strains; 3) the pattern of SDS-PAGE fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the protein at 18 kD known as P-fimbriae.
TI  - Identification of a transcriptional activator (ChnR) and a 6-oxohexanoate dehydrogenase (ChnE) in the cyclohexanol catabolic pathway in Acinetobacter sp. Strain NCIMB 9871 and localization of the genes that encode them.
AB  - We identified chnR, a gene encoding an AraC-XylS type of transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of chnB, the structural gene for cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) in Acinetobacter sp. strain NCIMB 9871. The gene sequence of chnE, which encodes an NADP(+)-linked 6-oxohexanoate dehydrogenase, the enzyme catalyzing the fifth step of cyclohexanol degradation, was also determined. The gene arrangement is chnB-chnE-chnR. The predicted molecular masses of the three polypeptides were verified by radiolabeling by using the T7 expression system. Inducible expression of cloned chnB in Escherichia coli depended upon the presence of chnR. A transcriptional chnB::lacZ fusion experiment revealed that cyclohexanone induces chnB expression in E. coli, in which a 22-fold increase in activity was observed.
TI  - Identification and characterization of ComE and ComF, two novel pilin-like competence factors involved in natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413.
AB  - Although the high level of competence for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 has been the subject of numerous studies, only two competence genes, comC and comP, have been identified to date. By chromosomal walking analysis we found two overlapping open reading frames, designated comE and comF, starting 61 bp downstream of comC. comE and comF are expressed as stable proteins in Escherichia coli, thus proving that they are indeed coding regions, but expression was successful only with 5'-deleted genes. ComE and ComF are similar to pilins and pilin-like components. Both genes were mutated, and the phenotypes of the mutants were analyzed. Natural transformation in comF mutants is 1,000-fold reduced, whereas comE mutants exhibit 10-fold-reduced transformation frequencies. This is clear evidence that comE and comF are involved in natural transformation. However, ComE and ComF are specific for DNA translocation, since comE and comF defects affected neither piliation nor lipase secretion. These results suggest that the type IV pili, the general protein secretion pathway, and the DNA translocation machinery in Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 are evolutionary related but functionally distinct systems.
TI  - Steroid monooxygenase of Rhodococcus rhodochrous: sequencing of the genomic DNA,  and hyperexpression, purification, and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.
AB  - Steroid monooxygenase of Rhodococcus rhodochrous is a Baeyer-Villigerase catalyzing the insertion of an oxygen atom between the C(17)- and C(20)-carbons of progesterone to produce testosterone acetate. The 5.1-kbp-long BamHI DNA fragment containing the steroid monooxygenase gene, smo, was cloned from the chromosomal DNA and sequenced. The smo gene is 1,650 nucleotides long, starts with a TTG codon, and ends with a TGA codon. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the enzyme protein consist of 549 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 60,133. Thus, the molecular mass of the holoenzyme is 60,919. The amino acid sequence is highly homologous (41.2% identity) to that of cyclohexanone monooxygenase of Acinetobacter sp. In the upstream of the smo gene, the genes of heat shock proteins, dnaK, grpE, and dnaJ, located on the complementary strand, and the DNA-inserts of pSMO and pD1, which contains the ksdD gene, were joined at the BamHI site of the dnaJ gene. The smo gene was modified at the initiation codon to ATG and ligated with an expression vector to construct a plasmid, pSMO-EX, and introduced into Escherichia coli cells. The transformed cells hyperexpressed the steroid monooxygenase as an active and soluble protein at more than 40 times the level in R. rhodochrous cells. Purification of the recombinant monooxygenase from the E. coli cells by simplified procedures yielded about 2.3 mg of enzyme protein/g wet cells. The purified recombinant steroid monooxygenase exhibited indistinguishable molecular and catalytic properties from those of the R. rhodochrous enzyme.
TI  - Selective adsorption of poly-His tagged glutaryl acylase on tailor-made metal chelate supports.
AB  - A poly-His tag was fused in the glutaryl acylase (GA) from Acinetobacter sp. strain YS114 cloned in E. coli yielding a fully active enzyme. Biochemical analyses showed that the tag did not alter the maturation of the chimeric GA (poly-His GA) that undergoes a complex post-translational processing from an inactive monomeric precursor to the active heterodimeric enzyme. This enzyme has been used as a model to develop a novel and very simple procedure for one-step purification of poly-His proteins via immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography on tailor-made supports. It was intended to improve the selectivity of adsorption of the target protein on tailor-made chelate supports instead of performing a selective desorption. The rate and extent of the adsorption of proteins from a crude extract from E. coli and of pure poly-His tagged GA on different metal chelate supports was studied. Up to 90% of proteins from E. coli were adsorbed on commercial chelate supports having a high density of ligands attached to the support through long spacer arms, while this adsorption becomes almost negligible when using low ligand densities, short spacer arms and Zn2+ or Co2+ as cations. On the contrary, poly-His GA adsorbs strongly enough on all supports. A strong affinity interaction between the poly-His tail and a single chelate moiety seems to be the responsible for the adsorption of poly-His GA. By contrast, multipoint weak interactions involving a number of chelate moieties seem to be mainly responsible for adsorption of natural proteins. By using tailor-made affinity supports, a very simple procedure for one-step purification of GA with minimal adsorption of host proteins could be performed. Up to 20 mg of GA were adsorbed on each ml of chelate support while most of accompanying proteins were hardly adsorbed on such supports. Following few washing steps, the target enzyme was finally recovered (80% yield) by elution with 50 mM imidazole with a very high increment of specific activity (up to a 120 purification factor).
TI  - areABC genes determine the catabolism of aryl esters in Acinetobacter sp. Strain  ADP1.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 is able to grow on a range of esters of aromatic alcohols, converting them to the corresponding aromatic carboxylic acids by the sequential action of three inducible enzymes: an areA-encoded esterase, an areB-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase, and an areC-encoded benzaldehyde dehydrogenase. The are genes, adjacent to each other on the chromosome and transcribed in the order areCBA, were located 3.5 kbp upstream of benK. benK, encoding a permease implicated in benzoate uptake, is at one end of the ben-cat supraoperonic cluster for benzoate catabolism by the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Two open reading frames which may encode a transcriptional regulator, areR, and a porin, benP, separate benK from areC. Each are gene was individually expressed to high specific activity in Escherichia coli. The relative activities against different substrates of the cloned enzymes were, within experimental error, identical to that of wild-type Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 grown on either benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, or 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol as the carbon source. The substrate preferences of all three enzymes were broad, encompassing a range of substituted aromatic compounds and in the case of the AreA esterase, different carboxylic acids. The areA, areB, and areC genes were individually disrupted on the chromosome by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette, and the rates at which the resultant strains utilized substrates of the aryl ester catabolic pathway were severely reduced as determined by growth competitions between the mutant and wild-type strains.
TI  - Characterization of the Acinetobacter plasmid, pRAY, and the identification of regulatory sequences upstream of an aadB gene cassette on this plasmid.
AB  - Primer extension analyses carried out to identify the transcription start site of an aadB gene, which is part of a gene cassette recombined at a secondary site on an Acinetobacter plasmid, pRAY, suggest that transcription control signals in Acinetobacter are similar but not identical to their counterparts in Escherichia coli. pRAY was sequenced. An AT-rich region, containing eight copies of the consensus sequence, AAAAAATAT, previously shown to be present in the origins of replication of other Acinetobacter plasmids, was predicted to be the origin of pRAY. The translation product of one of the 10 open reading frames identified on pRAY shows homology to the mobilization protein, MbeA.
TI  - The physiological contribution of Acinetobacter PcaK, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of VanK.
AB  - VanK is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with PcaK, BenK, and MucK, contributes to aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. VanK and PcaK have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype associated with inactivation of its homolog. Furthermore, vanK pcaK double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. This provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. Previous studies of aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. By using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. In this study, the overlapping specificity of the VanK and PcaK permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vanK or pcaK. Spontaneous mutations identified in vanK include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a G6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of VanK structure and function. Preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated PCR mutagenesis in one VanK mutant gave results similar to those using LacY, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. The selection for transport mutants described here for Acinetobacter may also be applicable to Pseudomonas putida, where the PcaK permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.
TI  - Rearing stable fly larvae (Diptera: Muscidae) on an egg yolk medium.
AB  - The growth and survival of Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) larvae on egg yolk medium inoculated with bacteria isolated from a colony of stable flies was evaluated. Five species of bacteria--Acinetobacter sp., Aeromonas sp., Empedobacter breve (Holmes & Owen), Flavobacterium odoratum Stutzer, and Serratia marcescens Bizio--were identified according to fatty acid profiles using a microbial identification system. Larvae failed to develop on uninoculated plates, confirming that bacteria are required to complete development. Larvae also failed to complete development on plates inoculated with Aeromonas sp. and S. marcescens, and died during the 1st instar. Larvae completed development on the remaining 3 bacterial species as well as on Escherichia coli (Migula). Survival was generally higher when larvae were reared on Acinetobacter sp. and F. odoratum compared with E. coli and E. breve. Egg density did not influence larval survival, although the variability in survival was lowest using 20 and 40 eggs per plate. Larval survival in mixed cultures of Acinetobacter and Flavobacterium averaged 22.7% lower than survival in the pure cultures, and averaged 21.6% higher in mixed cultures of Empedobacter and Flavobacterium compared with pure cultures. Larval survival in mixed cultures did not differ significantly from mean survival in pure cultures for combinations of Acinetobacter and E. coli, Acinetobacter and Empedobacter, E. coli and Empedobacter, and E. coli and Flavobacterium. Larval developmental time was faster on all mixed bacterial cultures compared with developmental time on pure bacterial cultures. Optimal sample sizes and egg numbers are presented for detecting specified differences in larval survival. This rearing procedure will be useful for studying insect-microbe interactions and evaluating mortality using bacterial agents.
TI  - A five-nucleotide sequence protects DNA from exonucleolytic degradation by AddAB, the RecBCD analogue of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Homologous recombination in Bacillus subtilis requires the product of the addA and addB genes, the AddAB enzyme. This enzyme, which is both a helicase and a powerful nuclease, is thought to be the counterpart of the Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme. From this analogy, it is expected that the nuclease activity of AddAB can be downregulated by a specific DNA sequence, which would correspond to the chi site in E. coli. Using protection of linear double-stranded DNA as a criterion, we identified the five-nucleotide sequence 5'-AGCGG-3', or its complement 5'-CCGCT-3', as being sufficient for AddAB nuclease attenuation. We have shown further that this attenuation occurs only if the sequence is properly oriented with respect to the translocating AddAB enzyme. Finally, inspection of the complete B. subtilis genome revealed that this five-nucleotide sequence is over-represented and is, in a majority of cases, co-oriented with DNA replication. Based on these observations, we propose that 5'-AGCGG-3', or its complement, is the B. subtilis analogue of the E. coli chi sequence.
TI  - Similarities between the antABC-encoded anthranilate dioxygenase and the benABC-encoded benzoate dioxygenase of Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 can use benzoate or anthranilate as a sole carbon source. These structurally similar compounds are independently converted to catechol, allowing further degradation to proceed via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. In this study, the first step in anthranilate catabolism was characterized. A mutant unable to grow on anthranilate, ACN26, was selected. The sequence of a wild-type DNA fragment that restored growth revealed the antABC genes, encoding 54-, 19-, and 39-kDa proteins, respectively. The deduced AntABC sequences were homologous to those of class IB multicomponent aromatic ring-dihydroxylating enzymes, including the dioxygenase that initiates benzoate catabolism. Expression of antABC in Escherichia coli, a bacterium that normally does not degrade anthranilate, enabled the conversion of anthranilate to catechol. Unlike benzoate dioxygenase (BenABC), anthranilate dioxygenase (AntABC) catalyzed catechol formation without requiring a dehydrogenase. In Acinetobacter mutants, benC substituted for antC during growth on anthranilate, suggesting relatively broad substrate specificity of the BenC reductase, which transfers electrons from NADH to the terminal oxygenase. In contrast, the benAB genes did not substitute for antAB. An antA point mutation in ACN26 prevented anthranilate degradation, and this mutation was independent of a mucK mutation in the same strain that prevented exogenous muconate degradation. Anthranilate induced expression of antA, although no associated transcriptional regulators were identified. Disruption of three open reading frames in the immediate vicinity of antABC did not prevent the use of anthranilate as a sole carbon source. The antABC genes were mapped on the ADP1 chromosome and were not linked to the two known supraoperonic gene clusters involved in aromatic compound degradation.
TI  - Detection of nptII (kanamycin resistance) genes in genomes of transgenic plants by marker-rescue transformation.
AB  - We have developed a novel system for the sensitive detection of nptII genes (kanamycin resistance determinants) including those present in transgenic plant genomes. The assay is based on the recombinational repair of an nptII gene with an internal 10-bp deletion located on a plasmid downstream of a bacterial promoter. Uptake of an nptII gene by transformation restores kanamycin resistance. In Escherichia coli, promoterless nptII genes provided by electroporation were rescued with high efficiency in a RecA-dependent recombinational process. For the rescue of nptII genes present in chromosomal plant DNA, the system was adapted to natural transformation, which favours the uptake of linear DNA. When competent Acinetobacter sp. BD413 (formerly A. calcoaceticus) cells containing the mutant nptII gene on a plasmid were transformed with DNA from various transgenic plants carrying nptII as a marker gene (Solanum tuberosum, Nicotiana tabacum, Beta vulgaris, Brassica napus, Lycopersicon esculentum), kanamycin-resistant transformants were obtained roughly in proportion to the concentration of nptII genes in the plant DNA. The rescue of nptII genes occurred in the presence of a more than 6 x 10(6)-fold excess of plant DNA. Only 18 ng of potato DNA (2.5 x 10(3) genome equivalents, each with one copy of nptII) was required to produce one kanamycin-resistant transformant. These experiments and others employing DNA isolated from soil samples demonstrate that the system allows reliable and highly sensitive monitoring of nptII genes in transgenic plant DNA and in DNA from environmental sources, such as soil, without the need for prior DNA amplification (e.g. by PCR).
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase  from a carboxydobacterium, Pseudomonas carboxydohydrogena.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase from Pseudomonas carboxydohydrogena, a carboxydobacterium, grown on carbon monoxide was purified 37.6-fold in seven steps to homogeneity, with a yield of 1.4%. The final specific activity was 2,396 units per mg protein as determined by an assay based on a 50% decrease in the rate of cytochrome c reduction. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined to be 42,500. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis revealed two identical subunits of molecular weight 21,700. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was found to be 9.0. The enzyme was stable to heat treatment. The isoelectric point of the native enzyme was found to be 7.1. The enzyme showed an absorption peak at 280 nm with a shoulder at around 289 nm. Sodium azide, but not sodium cyanide and hydrogen peroxide, was found to inhibit the enzyme activity. One mol of native enzyme was found to contain 1.09 g-atom of manganese. Analysis of amino acid composition revealed that the enzyme contains cysteine. The superoxide dismutase of P. carboxydohydrogena was found to have antigenic sites identical to those of Oligotropha carboxydovorans. The enzyme showed partial identity to Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava and Escherichia coli enzymes, but no identity to Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 enzyme.
TI  - Transcription of ppk from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1, encoding a putative polyphosphate kinase, is induced by phosphate starvation.
AB  - Polyphosphate kinase (Ppk) catalyzes the formation of polyphosphate from ATP. We  cloned the ppk gene (2,073 bp) from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1; this gene encodes a putative polypeptide of 78.6 kDa with extensive homology to polyphosphate kinase from Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Chromosomal disruption of ppk by inserting a transcriptionally fused lacZ does not affect growth under conditions of phosphate limitation or excess. beta-Galactosidase activity expressed from the single-copy ppk::lacZ fusion is induced 5- to 15-fold by phosphate starvation. An increased amount of ppk transcript (2.2 kb) was detected when cells were grown at a limiting phosphate concentration. Primer extension analysis revealed a regulated promoter located upstream of a second, constitutive promoter. Potential similarities of this regulation with the effects of PhoB and PhoR of E. coli are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of genes encoding an enzyme which oxidizes dimethyl  sulfide in Acinetobacter sp. strain 20B.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain 20B was isolated based on the ability to utilize dimethyl sulfide as the sole sulfur source. Since strain 20B oxidized indole as well as dimethyl sulfide, indigo production by recombinant Escherichia coli clones carrying Acinetobacter DNA was used as a selection for cloning genes encoding dimethyl sulfide oxidation genes. The gene encoding an indole-oxidizing enzyme was also found to oxidize dimethyl sulfide. The dimethyl sulfide-oxidizing enzyme genes consisted of six open reading flames designated dsoABCDEF. The deduced amino acid sequences of dsoABCDEF were homologous with those of the multicomponent phenol hydroxylases. DsoABCDEF oxidized dimethyl sulfide to dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethyl sulfone.
TI  - Effect of fluorochromes on bacterial surface properties and interaction with granular media.
AB  - Simple, efficient, and safe tagging methods are desired in short-term microbial transport studies such as in the study of filtration systems for water and wastewater treatment. Suitability of selected fluorochromes as bacterial tagging agents in transport studies was evaluated on the basis of stability of stained cells and the effect of staining on bacterial surface characteristics and interaction with granular media. Surface properties were characterized by zeta potential and microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons. The effect of staining on interactions between bacteria and porous media was evaluated in terms of removal of bacteria in batch adsorption tests using sand coated with aluminum hydroxide to enhance adsorption. The DNA-specific fluorochrome 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) had generally negligible effects on bacterial surface properties and interaction with sand, as indicated in batch adsorption tests using pure cultures (Escherichia coli or Acinetobacter sp.) and wastewater bacteria. Cells stained with DAPI were stable for 48 h at 4 or 20 degrees C. Other nucleic acid fluorochromes tested had different but significant effects on bacterial cells and produced less stable fluorescence. Since transport through porous media is modulated by surface properties, it may be concluded based on these results that the choice of fluorochromes is critical in microbial transport studies. DAPI appeared to be a promising tagging agent. Time dependence of fluorescence of stained cells may limit the use of fluorochrome-tagged cells in long-term transport studies.
TI  - Survival of Acinetobacter baumannii on dry surfaces.
AB  - Acinetobacter spp. have frequently been reported to be the causative agents of hospital outbreaks. The circumstances of some outbreaks demonstrated the long survival of Acinetobacter in a dry, inanimate environment. In laboratory experiments, we compared the abilities of five Acinetobacter baumannii strains, three Acinetobacter sp. strains from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), one Escherichia coli ATCC strain, and one Enterococcus faecium ATCC strain to survive under dry conditions. Bacterial solutions of the 10 strains were inoculated onto four different material samples (ceramic, polyvinyl chloride, rubber, and stainless steel) and stored under defined conditions. We investigated the bacterial counts of the material samples immediately after inoculation, after drying, and after 4 h, 1 day, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of storage. A statistical model was used to distribute the 40 resulting curves among four types of survival curves. The type of survival curve was significantly associated with the bacterial strain but not with the material. The ability of the A. baumannii strains to survive under dry conditions varied greatly and correlated well with the source of the strain. Strains isolated from dry sources survived better than those isolated from wet sources. An outbreak strain that had caused hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections survived better than the strains from wet sources, but not as well as strains from dry sources. Resistance to dry conditions may promote the transmissibility of a strain, but it is not sufficient to make a strain an epidemic one. However, in the case of an outbreak, sources of Acinetobacter must be expected in the dry environment.
TI  - Plasmid-encoded genes specifying aniline oxidation from Acinetobacter sp. strain  YAA.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA is able to use aniline and o-toluidine as the sole carbon and energy source. This strain has several different plasmids and acridine orange curing suggested that aniline utilization in strain YAA was plasmid-encoded. The gene cluster involved in aniline oxidation was cloned in Escherichia coli JM109 from the total plasmid DNA of strain YAA. A recombinant E. coli containing an 18.5 kb insert fragment showed yellow colouration on aniline-containing plates, indicating the formation of 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde from aniline. In addition, subcloning of a 9.0 kb SalI fragment from the insert in E. coli resulted in the accumulation of catechol. Southern hybridization studies indicated that the aniline oxygenase gene (atdA) was present on one of the plasmids, pYA1. These results suggest that in strain YAA aniline is degraded via catechol through a pathway involving meta-cleavage of the benzene-ring by plasmid-encoded genes including atdA.
TI  - [Study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. Part 1. An analysis of causal organisms].
AB  - Causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to Jikei University Hospital from 1975 to 1994. Eighty patients (50.6%) were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. The average mortality rate was 18.4%. The mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. Staphylococcus aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), Escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and Haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). H. influenzae, Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus (GBS) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). The mortality rate of Klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), S. aureus (24.1%), S. pneumoniae (22.2%). H. influenzae and Acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. E. coli and GBS were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. H. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. Acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and Acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. E. coli, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and GBS were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Phosphate concentration regulates transcription of the Acinetobacter polyhydroxyalkanoic acid biosynthetic genes.
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) biosynthetic gene locus was cloned and characterized from an Acinetobacter sp. isolated from activated sludge. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified three clustered genes, phaAAc (encoding a beta-ketothiolase), phaBAc (encoding an acetoacetyl coenzyme A reductase), and phaCAc (encoding a PHA synthase). In addition, an open reading frame (ORF1) with potential to encode a 13-kDa protein was identified within this locus. The sequence of the putative translational product of ORF1 does not show significant similarity to any sequences in the database. A plasmid containing the Acinetobacter pha locus conferred the ability to accumulate poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate on its Escherichia coli host. These genes appear to lie in an operon transcribed by two promoters upstream of phaBAc, an apparent constitutive promoter, and a second promoter induced by phosphate starvation and under pho regulon control. These as well as a number of additional potential transcription start points were identified by a combination of primer extension and promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene fusion studies carried out in Acinetobacter or E. coli transformants.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Characterization of the chromosomal aac(6')-Ij gene of Acinetobacter sp. 13 and the aac(6')-Ih plasmid gene of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The amikacin resistance genes aac(6')-Ih of Acinetobacter baumannii BM2686 and aac(6')-Ij of Acinetobacter sp. 13 BM2689 encoding aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferases were characterized. The 441-bp coding sequences predict proteins with calculated masses of 16,698 and 16,677 Da, respectively. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the proteins belonged to a subfamily of 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase type I enzymes from gram-negative bacteria. The aac(6')-Ih gene of BM2686 was located on a 13.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid. The aac(6')-Ij gene from BM2689 was not transferable either by conjugation to Escherichia coli or A. baumannii or by transformation to Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Plasmid DNA from BM2689 did not hybridize with an intragenic aac(6')-Ij probe. These results suggest a chromosomal location for this gene. The aac(6')-Ij gene was detected by DNA hybridization in all 28 strains of Acinetobacter sp. 13 tested but not in other Acinetobacter strains, including A. baumannii, proteolytic genospecies 4, 6, 14, 15, 16, and 17, and ungrouped strains. The aac(6')-Ih and -Ij probes did not hybridize in dot blot assays with DNA from members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae that produced 6'-N-acetyltransferases. These data suggest that the genes are confined to the Acinetobacter genus and that the aac(6')-Ij gene is species specific and may be used to identify Acinetobacter sp. 13.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the polychlorinated biphenyl-degradation gene cluster from Arthrobacter M5 and comparison to analogous genes from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Arthrobacter M5 was characterized genetically to determine if the catabolic pathway (controlled by the bph genes), responsible for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) biodegradation in this Gram-positive strain, was similar to the pathways characterized from various Gram-negative bacteria. Arthrobacter M5 was originally isolated as a contaminant from a culture of the PCB degrader, Acinetobacter sp. strain P6. A bph-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) gene probe (bphC2) was designed by aligning the published sequences of two bphC genes (encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase) and synthesizing a 29-nucleotide (nt) fragment from a conserved region of the gene. The bphC2 oligo was used as a probe to identify a 10-kb HindIII fragment of total DNA from Arthrobacter M5 and subsequently to isolate Escherichia coli clones possessing bphC. The PCB-degradation genes were expressed in E. coli, but expression was increased by subcloning in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The nt and amino acid sequences of the region corresponding to the Arthrobacter M5 bphC gene showed a very high degree of homology with the published sequences of bphC genes from Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for citrate synthase from a thermotolerant Bacillus sp.
AB  - The structural gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate Bacillus sp. strain C4 (ATCC 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at pH 5.0 to 7.0 in the presence of dolime has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. The nucleotide sequence of the entire 3.1-kb HindIII fragment has been determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsA). Citrate synthase from Bacillus sp. strain C4 was found to be a dimer (Mr, 84,500) with a subunit with an Mr of 42,000. The N-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. The kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. Bacillus sp. strain C4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by NADH, ATP, ADP, or AMP at levels up to 1 mM. The predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the E. coli, Acinetobacter anitratum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam in lower respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  - The pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. The use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. The two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. More than 90% of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. Serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. Good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. In over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. Satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. The cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.
TI  - Conjugational transfer of recombinant DNA in cultures and in soils: host range of Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmids.
AB  - Recombinant TOL plasmid pWWO-EB62 allows Pseudomonas putida to grow on p-ethylbenzoate. This plasmid can be transferred to other microorganisms, and its catabolic functions for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates are expressed in a limited number of gram-negative bacteria, including members of pseudomonad rRNA group I and Escherichia coli. Transfer of the recombinant plasmid to Erwinia chrysanthemi was observed, but transconjugants failed to grow on alkylbenzoates because they lost catabolic functions. Pseudomonads belonging to rRNA groups II, III, and IV, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Alcaligenes sp. could not act as recipients for TOL, either because the plasmid was not transferred or because it was not stably maintained. The frequency of transfer of pWWO-EB62 from P. putida as a donor to pseudomonads belonging to rRNA group I was on the order of 1 to 10(-2) transconjugant per recipient, while the frequency of intergeneric transfer ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-7) transconjugant per recipient. The profile of potential hosts was conserved when the donor bacterium was Escherichia coli or Erwinia chrysanthemi instead of P. putida. No intergeneric gene transfer of the recombinant TOL plasmid was observed in soils; however, intraspecies transfer did take place. Intraspecies transfer of TOL in soils was affected by the type of soil used, the initial inoculum size, and the presence of chemicals that could affect the survival of the donor or recipient bacteria.
TI  - Aminoglycosides versus beta-lactams in gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  - Newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. There is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, Enterobacter sp, and Acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. At this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. Thus, combination therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Prevalence of nosocomial infections in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital.
AB  - The rate of nosocomial infections was determined during a 9-month study in a 6-year-old hospital in north Saudi Arabia. The overall rate of nosocomial infection in the hospital was 2.2%. The rates in the different services varied. The highest were in the Special Care Baby Unit (13.5%) and Intensive Care Unit (6%). In the other services it ranged from 1 to 3.5%. The common causal agents of documented infections were Escherichia coli (81), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (55), Staphylococcus aureus (43), Klebsiella spp. (23), Candida spp. (15), Proteus spp. (14), enterococci (13), Enterobacter spp. (7), Acinetobacter spp. (2) and Providencia sp. (1). The most commonly infected sites from which these organisms were isolated were urine (133), wounds (48), umbilical cord (18), high vaginal infection (13), blood (11), burn respiratory tract infection (10 each).
TI  - Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  - We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.
TI  - [Identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  - Results of identification and classification of 204 strains of Gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. Among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including P. fluorescens (63), P. putida (9), P. maltophilia (12), P. putrefaciens (2), and P. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of Alcaligenes, both identified as A. denitrificans; 7 strains of Flavobacterium, including F. multovorum (3) and Flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of Acinetobacter, including A. lwoffi (7) and A. anitratus (2). Among 98 strains of fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; Escherichia (9), E. coli (12), Enterobacter Liquefaciens (31), Ent. cloacae (7), Ent. halfnia (8), Ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be ascertained.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the vagina and uterus of healthy cats.
AB  - Bacterial culturing was conducted on samples from the reproductive tracts of 53 clinically healthy female cats. Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 52 of 53 vaginal swab samples and from 2 of 29 uterine swab samples. Anaerobic bacteria were detected in 4 of 30 vaginal and 1 of 29 uterine cultures. The aerobic bacteria included species of Acinetobacter, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus canis, and E coli were the most common organisms and were isolated from 56%, 52%, and 44% of the vaginal samples, respectively. Anaerobes isolated from vaginal samples included 3 species of Bacteroides and 2 isolates of Peptococcus. The single uterine anaerobe isolate was a Lactobacillus sp. The number of bacterial species isolated from each vaginal culture ranged from 1 to 8 (mean, 3). The number of colony forming units tended to vary inversely with the number of bacterial species detected in each sample.
TI  - Expression of an Erwinia sp. gene encoding diphenyl ether cleavage in Escherichia coli and an isolated Acinetobacter strain PE7.
AB  - An Acinetobacter strain PE7 with the ability to grow on salicyclic acid and to degrade diphenyl ethers was isolated from a petroleum waste pit in Louisiana. A cloned Erwinia sp. dpe gene encoding diphenyl ether cleavage was introduced into PE7 in order to enhance its degradative ability. A broad-host-range expression plasmid, pDPE2388, was constructed by inserting an SspI-HpaI fragment from a dpe gene-containing plasmid, pDPE7321, into the kanamycin resistance gene of plasmid pKT230. The DNA fragment contained the dpe gene flanked between sp6 and T7 promoters. Transconjugants of pDPE2388 plasmid into PE7 were isolated. Expression of the dpe gene in Escherichia coli or PE7 displayed a degradative ability to cleave the following diphenyl ethers: 4-chlorodiphenyl ether, 4-nitrodiphenyl ether, and 4-hydroxydiphenyl ether.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Cloning of a carbofuran hydrolase gene from Achromobacter sp. strain WM111 and its expression in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A 14-kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI DNA fragment that encodes an enzyme capable of rapid hydrolysis of N-methylcarbamate insecticides (carbofuran hydrolase) was cloned from carbofuran-degrading Achromobacter sp. strain WM111. When used to probe Southern blots containing plasmid and total DNAs from WM111, this 14-kbp fragment hybridized strongly to a 14-kbp EcoRI fragment from the greater than 100-kbp plasmid harbored by this strain but weakly to EcoRI-digested total DNA from Achromobacter sp. strain WM111, indicating that the gene for N-methylcarbamate degradation (mcd) is plasmid encoded. Further subcloning localized the mcd gene on a 3-kbp ScaI-ClaI fragment. There was little or no expression of this gene in the alternative gram-negative hosts Pseudomonas putida, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Achromobacter pestifer. Western blotting (immunoblotting) of the protein products produced by low-level expression in P. putida confirmed that this 3-kbp fragment encodes the two 70+-kilodalton protein products seen in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified carbofuran hydrolase.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Occurrence, transfer and mobilization in epilithic strains of Acinetobacter of mercury-resistance plasmids capable of transformation.
AB  - A 7.8 kb plasmid (pQM17) encoding mercury resistance was isolated from two epilithic strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The plasmid had a broad host range when mobilized by RP1, transferring into Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Chromobacterium sp. with frequencies ranging from 5.3 x 10(-9) to 4.6 x 10(-4) per recipient. The plasmid could be transferred into A. calcoaceticus BD413 using intact cells of donor and recipient bacteria (i.e. natural transformation) and there was a broad temperature optimum (14-37 degrees C) for transformation. Transformation was as efficient in liquid matings as on plates but there was no effect of pH in the range 5.6-7.9. Maximum transformation frequencies were obtained after 24 h on agar plates containing 3.5-10 g C 1-1 with donor to recipient ratios ranging from 6 to 415.
TI  - Acinetobacter cyclohexanone monooxygenase: gene cloning and sequence determination.
AB  - The gene coding for cyclohexanone monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain NCIB 9871 was isolated by immunological screening methods. We located and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The structural gene is 1,626 nucleotides long and codes for a polypeptide of 542 amino acids; 389 nucleotides 5' and 108 nucleotides 3' of the coding region are also reported. The complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme was derived by translation of the nucleotide sequence. From a comparison of the amino acid sequence with consensus sequences of nucleotide-binding folds, we identified a potential flavin-binding site at the NH2 terminus of the enzyme (residues 6 to 18) and a potential nicotinamide-binding site extending from residue 176 to residue 208 of the protein. An overproduction system for the gene to facilitate genetic manipulations was also constructed by using the tac promoter vector pKK223-3 in Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Purification and characterization of quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus L.M.D. 79.41.
AB  - Quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.17) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus L.M.D. 79.41 was purified to homogeneity. It is a basic protein with an isoelectric point of 9.5 and an Mr of 94,000. Denaturation yields two molecules of PQQ/molecule and a protein with an Mr of 48000, indicating that the enzyme consists of two subunits, which are probably identical because even numbers of aromatic amino acids were found. The oxidized enzyme form has an absorption maximum at 350 nm, and the reduced form, obtained after the addition of glucose, at 338 nm. Since double-reciprocal plots of initial reaction rates with various concentrations of glucose or electron acceptor show parallel lines, and substrate inhibition is observed for glucose as well as for electron acceptor at high concentrations, a ping-pong kinetic behaviour with the two reactants exists. From the plots, Km values for glucose and Wurster's Blue of 22 mM and 0.78 mM respectively, and a Vmax. of 7.730 mumol of glucose oxidized/min per mg of protein were derived. The enzyme shows a broad substrate specificity for aldose sugars. Cationic electron acceptors are active in the assay, anionic acceptors are not. A pH optimum of 9.0 was found with Wurster's Blue and 6.0 with 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol. Two types of quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenases seem to exist: type I enzymes are acidic proteins from which PQQ can be removed by dialysis against EDTA-containing buffers (examples are found in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas sp.); type II enzymes are basic proteins from which PQQ is not removed by dialysis against EDTA-containing buffers (examples are found in A. calcoaceticus and Gluconobacter oxydans).
TI  - Influence of substratum hydration and adsorbed macromolecules on bacterial attachment to surfaces.
AB  - The attachment of Pseudomonas fluorescens and an Acinetobacter sp. to hydrogel and polystyrene surfaces was investigated to evaluate the influence of adsorbed water and macromolecules on adhesion. With both organisms, there was a decrease in attachment numbers with increasing water content of the hydrogels. There was also a decrease in attachment with a decrease in water contact angle on untreated, tissue culture and sulfonated polystyrene surfaces; however, the attachment numbers were higher than would be expected on the basis of the hydrogel data. With P. fluorescens, attachment to untreated and tissue culture polystyrene was inhibited by bovine serum albumin, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and the supernatant from spent medium, both when the conditioning substances were added to the suspension of attaching cells and when they were preadsorbed onto the surfaces. Dextran inhibited attachment only when added to the bacterial suspension. Supernatants from centrifuged natural freshwater samples had no effect. Thus, hydration of a surface and the adsorption of macromolecules can reduce bacterial attachment; however, additional factors relating to the chemical composition of the substratum and polymeric stabilization of suspended cells can affect the adhesion interaction and resultant numbers of attached cells.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - [Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain with a wide spectrum of utilizing aromatic compounds and carrying a plasmid for resorcin degradation].
AB  - A bacterial strain was isolated from soil and identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. lwoffii. The strain can utilize a wide spectrum of aromatic compounds. It carries a transmissive plasmid pBSW13 which determines resorcin utilization via the ortho pathway including the following steps: resorcin-hydroxyhydroquinone-maleylacetate-beta-ketoadipi c acid. The plasmid has been transferred by conjugation into the recipient strains of A. calcoaceticus 5734 CCM rifr, Escherichia coli J-53 met-pro-rifr and Klebsiella sp. Plasmid DNA with a molecular mass close to that of phage gamma was detected by electrophoresis in the donor and recombinant strains. The degradation of other substrates is not a phenotypic expression of the genes of this plasmid.
TI  - [Therapeutic effects of micronomicin against severe infections in patients with hematopoietic disorders. Hanshin Infection Study Group].
AB  - Micronomicin (MCR) at a daily dose of 120 to 360 mg was administered to patients  with severe infections who had hematopoietic disorders as underlying diseases. Efficacy and safety of the drug were evaluated. The underlying diseases in the 56 patients included in the evaluation of efficacy were acute myelocytic leukemia (24 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (8), acute promyelocytic leukemia (6), acute monomyelocytic leukemia (4), acute monocytic leukemia (1), erythroleukemia (1), chronic myelocytic leukemia-blastic crisis (4), malignant lymphoma (3), aplastic anemia (2), and others (3). The infections were septicemia in 9 patients, suspected septicemia in 48, respiratory tract infection in 7, and perianal abscess in 2. The clinical efficacy of MCR was 'excellent' in 12 patients, 'good' in 17, 'fair' in 7, 'poor' in 30 for an efficacy rate of 43.9%. The efficacy rate classified according to infections was 22.2% in septicemia, 56.3% in suspected septicemia. The organisms isolated from the patients with septicemia were Escherichia coli in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1, and Acinetobacter sp. in 1. The efficacy rate was 15.4% in the 13 patients whose causative organisms were identified. The efficacy rate for patients who had failed to respond to prior antibiotic therapy was 43.9%. The efficacy rate in patients (34 cases) with an initial neutrophil count less than 100/microliter was 44.1%. Side effect which might have been caused by MCR was skin eruption in only one episode among 83 episodes those were evaluated for safety.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Amifloxacin activity against well-defined gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Amifloxacin (WIN 49375) activity against a well-defined group of gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli was compared with the activity of 11 other antimicrobial agents. For all strains, amifloxacin and norfloxacin were the most active agents, followed by cefotaxime and moxalactam. For Acinetobacter sp. only amifloxacin had an achievable MIC for 90% of the strains. Amifloxacin joins other newly developed DNA gyrase inhibitors as potentially useful agents for infections due to aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Effect of physiological age on radiation resistance of some bacteria that are highly radiation resistant.
AB  - Physiological age-dependent variation in radiation resistance was studied for three bacteria that are highly radiation resistant: Micrococcus radiodurans, Micrococcus sp. isolate C-3, and Moraxella sp. isolate 4. Stationary-phase cultures of M. radiodurans and isolate C-3 were much more resistant to gamma radiation than were log-phase cultures. This pattern of relative resistance was reversed for isolate 4. Resistance of isolate 4 to UV light was also greater during log phase, although heat resistance and NaCl tolerance after heat stress were greater during stationary phase. Radiation-induced injury of isolate 4 compared with injury of Escherichia coli B suggested that the injury process, as well as the lethal process, was affected by growth phase. The hypothesis that growth rate affects radiation resistance was tested, and results were interpreted in light of the probable confounding effect of methods used to alter growth rates of bacteria. These results indicate that dose-response experiments should be designed to measure survival during the most resistant growth phase of the organism under study. This timing is particularly important when extrapolations of survival results might be made to potential irradiation processes for foods.
TI  - The influence of incubation temperature and pH on the antimicrobial properties of hen egg albumen.
AB  - Gram positive bacteria, including lysozyme-resistant strains, and yeasts were killed in hen egg albumen with or without iron at 30 of 39.5 degrees C. The albumen was more toxic at 39.5 degrees C than at 30 degrees C for Gram negative bacteria. With the exceptions of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Acinetobacter sp. and Proteus vulgaris, iron caused the growth of Gram negative bacteria or protected them from being killed in hen albumen at 39.5 degrees C. At this temperature, however, maximal growth of and glucose utilization by Escherichia coli C20 only occurred in albumen supplemented with growth factors, trace metals, additional nitrogen and sufficient iron to quench ovotransferrin. The bactericidal properties of albumen could be negated by changing its pH from 9.0 or above to 7.5 or below. At 39.5 degrees C, enterochelin allowed growth of E. coli in albumen at pH 7.9, but not at 9.4, whereas iron allowed growth at both pH values.
TI  - Insertional specificity of transposon Tn5 in Acinetobacter sp.
AB  - Suicide plasmid pJB4JI, containing transposon Tn5 and phage Mu, was introduced from Escherichia coli 1830 into Acinetobacter sp. strain HO1-N and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD413. Kanamycin-resistant (Kmr) exconjugants of HO1-N and BD413, isolated on complex medium, were screened for auxotrophic requirements. Over 10,000 Kmr clones were examined, but no auxotrophs were detected. Several Kmr exconjugants of BD413 and HO1-N, obtained from independent matings, were chosen for further study. All Tn5-containing strains exhibited kanamycin phosphotransferase activity. Kmr strains lacked plasmid DNA as determined by three plasmid screening procedures, and the Kmr phenotype was not transferable by conjugal matings to kanamycin-sensitive BD413, HO1-N, or E. coli HB101. The chromosomal location of Tn5 insertions in independently isolated Kmr exconjugants of BD413 and HO1-N was characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and hybridization studies. Results obtained from Southern hybridization studies were consistent with a single Tn5-specific insertion site in HO1-N and two such sites in BD413. Phage Mu sequences were not detected in Tn5-containing Acinetobacter sp.
TI  - Inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. The minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by Proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), Enterobacter sp and Citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), Providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). When compared with the ranges of activity of seven reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for P aeruginosa, Citrobacter sp, Proteus sp, and A calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against Enterobacter sp. For amikacin-resistant P aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. The MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of amifloxacin were similar. For all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.
TI  - Stereospecificity in meta-fission catabolic pathways.
AB  - The stereospecificities of 2-keto-4-pentenoate hydratase and 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase were studied in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter sp. Hydration was stereospecific in all three; however, only P. putida and Acinetobacter sp. showed stereospecificity in their aldolase reactions.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Plasmids encoding trimethoprim resistance in bacterial isolates from man and pigs.
AB  - Trimethoprim (Tp) resistant Gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and  pigs. The bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. The presence of transferable Tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. The Tp R-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as Tc, Cm, Sp, Sm and Su. Incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, Inc FIV and Inc N. Thirty of 99 Tp R-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as Inc FIV and eight as Inc N. The results of molecular weight determination of Tp R-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger R-plasmids (76 to 104 Md) belonging to Inc FIV and lower molecular weight R-plasmids (25 to 35 Md) belonging to Inc N. Results from this study indicate that the Tp R-plasmids isolated in Perth have evolved independently from those described in Europe and the United Kingdom. There is also evidence for their local spread between Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter from man and animals.
TI  - Hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel.
AB  - A quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. Overall, 31% of health care workers carried aerobic Gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (P < 0.001). Enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other Enterobacter spp. 7%. Other organisms included Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, Serratia spp. 11%, Klebsiella spp. 10%, Moraxella spp. 3%, Pseudomonas spp. 3%, Proteus spp. 1.5%, Escherichia coli 1%; Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas sp. and an isolate that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. We conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. Enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Effects of growth substrate and respiratory chain composition on bioenergetics in Acinetobacter sp. strain HO1-N.
AB  - The relationship between respiratory chain composition and efficiency of coupling phosphorylation to electron transport was examined in Acinetobacter sp. strain HO1-N. Cells containing only cytochrome o as a terminal oxidase displayed the same stoichiometries of adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis and proton extrusion as cells which contained both cytochromes o and d as terminal oxidases. In addition, CO inhibition and photo-relief of cytochromes o or d did not alter the efficiency of energy coupling. These findings indicate that adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis is coupled to electron transport through both cytochromes o and d in Acinetobacter.
TI  - [Histological and bacteriological examination of uterus from the repeat breeder gilt and sow (author's transl)].
AB  - The investigation comprised sexual organs from 25 gilts and 97 sows culled because of repeat breeding. Among the gilts 24.0 per cent and among the sows 25.8 per cent had endometritis. The following germs were present in uterus from gilts and sows with signs of endometritis: Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium pyogenes, alpha-hemolytiske streptococcer, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella sp., Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Citrobacter sp. Among gilts and sows with germs present in uterus 40.9 per cent had endometritis. The corresponding per cent among gilts and sows without germs present was 25.0.
TI  - Properties of six pesticide degradation plasmids isolated from Alcaligenes paradoxus and Alcaligenes eutrophus.
AB  - Biophysical and genetic properties of six independently isolated plasmids encoding the degradation of the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid are described. Four of the plasmids, pJP3, pJP4, pJP5, and pJP7, had molecular masses of 51 megadaltons, belonged to the IncP1 incompatibility group, and transferred freely to strains of Escherichia coli, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, Rhizobium sp., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. In addition, these four plasmids conferred resistance to merbromin, phenylmercury acetate, and mercuric ions, had almost identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns, and encoded degradation of m-chlorobenzoate. The two other plasmids, pJP2 and pJP9, did not belong to the IncP1 incompatibility group, had molecular masses of 37 megadaltons, encoded the degradation of phenoxyacetic acid, and possessed identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A, a derivative of fortimicin A.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A (ODMF), a derivative of fortimicin A, was compared with those of fortimicin A and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. All three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter sp., and Staphylococcus aureus, with ODMF most active against Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. Activity of each of the antibiotics against group D streptococci was poor. The overall activity of ODMF was superior to that of fortimicin A for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both ODMF and fortimicin A were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-N-acetyltransferase-I. ODMF and fortimicin A showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin G. The combination of carbenicillin with ODMF, fortimicin A, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested. Inactivation of ODMF and fortimicin A when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. ODMF, fortimicin A, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, S. aureus, or P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin was the most active, followed by ODMF and fortimicin A. The superior in vitro activity of ODMF compared with fortimicin A against P. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
TI  - Differential toxicities of mercury to bacteria and bacteriophages in sea and in lake water.
AB  - Mixtures of anionic HgCl3-/HgCl4(2)-complexes were less toxic to terrestrial bacteria (Erwinia herbicola, Agrobacterium tumefaciens), to marine bacteria (Acinetobacter sp., Aeromonas sp.), and to bacteriophages (phi 11 M 15 of Staphylococcus aureus and P1 of Escherichia coli) than were equivalent concentrations of Hg as cationic Hg2+. The toxicity of 1 ppm Hg to A. tumefaciens. Aeromonas sp., and phi 11 M 15 was less in seawater than in lake water. Inasmuch as the Hg-Cl species are formed in environments of high chloride concentration, it was postulated that the lower toxicity of Hg in seawater was a result of the formation of HgCl3-/HgCl4(2)-complexes.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Drug resistance in relation to use of silver sulphadiazine cream in a burns unit.
AB  - Topical chemoprophylaxis of extensive burns with silver sulphadiazine cream led to a large increase in the proportion of sulphadiazine-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in a burns unit. When all sulphonamide treatment in the ward was stopped; the incidence of sulphonamide-resistant strains fell back to levels similar to those recorded when silver sulphadiazine treatment was introduced. This was associated with a large reduction in the incidence of resistance of certain Gram-negative bacilli (especially Klebstella sp) to several antibiotics. Transferable resistance to sulphadiazine, shown by conjugation experiments with Escherichia coli K12, was found in a majority of the strains of Klebsiella sp tested, and in other species. A pattern of transferable resistance to tetracycline, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and sulphadiazine (T Ce Cl A Ca S) was found in four of the 22 strains of Klebsiella tested, and closely related patterns were transferred by five other strains. These patterns of resistance were commonly found in Klebsiella sp isolated from burns in the period before the withdrawal of sulphonamides from the ward but were found in none of the Klebsiella strains isolated in the first six months after that period. Strains of Acinetobacter and Proteus, in which transferable resistance was not found, showed no appreciable fall or rise in sulphadiazine resistance; there was no fall in resistance of these organisms to tetracycline, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, ampicillin or carbenicillin on withdrawal of sulphonamides from the ward, but there were substantial falls in resistance of Acinetobacter to kanamycin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline which were probably not caused by the withdrawal of sulphonamides.
TI  - Susceptibility of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus (Herellea vaginicola) to minocycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of minocycline against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus (Herellea vaginicola) was examined. All strains of A. anitratus were inhibited by minocycline at concentrations of 0.4 mug/ml or less. The strains studied were considerably more susceptible to minocycline than tetracycline. No difference between the susceptibility to minocycline and tetracycline was seen with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter and Proteus sp. A regression line of the log minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and the diameter of the zone of inhibition, determined by the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed good linear correlation for minocycline. Comparison of the disk diffusion results and MICs indicated that an inhibitory zone size of 19 mm produced by a 30-mug minocycline disk was equivalent to a MIC of 3.1 mug/ml, a serum concentration achieved by oral administration of the drug. When the zone of inhibition was greater than 19 mm, however, there was poor correlation with the MIC for Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the hemolymph of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus: numerical taxonomy.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from the hemolymph of normal blue crabs were found to be predominantly Vibrio sp., Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Flavobacterium sp., and coliforms. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a cosmopolitan facultative pathogen widely implicated in outbreaks of gastroenteritis related to the consumption of improperly processed seafood, was present in crabs collected between the months of May to November and was identified in up to 21% of the hemolymphs sampled.
TI  - Ultrastructure of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria with different fixation techniques.
AB  - The ultrastructure of the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall of two strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, P. vulgaris, Acinetobacter anitratum, Moraxella lacunata, Erwinia amylovora, Acinetobacter sp., and of a plant pathogen, unclassified gram-negative, fixed by the Ryter-Kellenberger procedure, was found to be significantly affected by the use or omission of the uranyl postfixation included in that procedure, and by the presence or absence of calcium in the OsO(4) fixative. The omission of the uranyl treatment results in a less clear profile of both the outer membrane of the cell wall and of the cytoplasmic membrane. The observation of these two membranes is further limited when both uranyl and calcium are omitted. The R-layer and the material covering the surface of the cell wall appear more distinct when the uranyl postfixation is not used. Evidence is given suggesting that the influence of uranyl and calcium ions on the appearance of the outer and cytoplasmic membranes would be primarily due to their action as fixatives, whereas the influence of uranyl on the appearance of the R-layer would be due to a direct action on the peptidoglycan component of this layer. When uranyl acetate is used as a section stain after the embedding in plastic, it improves the observation of the R-layer. In this case, a well contrasted R-layer is consistently observed in all strains studied, provided that the postfixation has been omitted. The frequent difficulty in clearly observing the R-layer in many published micrographs probably results from the common use of uranyl postfixation.
