TI  == quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  == various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qpcr in a single cohort. we quantify these bacteria (fusobacterium  spp., streptococcus gallolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and afac-  or pks-positive e. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. we further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and msi-status. with the exception of s. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. etbf (fdr = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afac-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. etbf (fdr = 0.04 and  0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and fusobacterium spp. (fdr =  0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (iii/iv) colorectal cancers. fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). we also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by fusobacterium and msi-h (fdr = 0.05), age (fdr = 0.03) or pks-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.01). furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical epec in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. by quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of fusobacterium and etbf.

TI  == appendicitis in a child due to streptococcus pneumoniae: a rare case report.
AB  == a variety of bacterial species play a major role in appendicitis. both aerobic and anaerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species and citrobacter freundii cause appendicitis. appendicitis is usually polymicrobial. the case assumes importance because of single aetiological agent i.e. unimicrobial and no predisposing factors are present to cause infection. we report a rare case of appendicitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae in child. this case emphasizes that streptococcus pneumoniae can cause wide spectrum of disease  like appendicitis.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == effects of gatifloxaine content in gatifloxacine-loaded plga and beta-tricalcium  phosphate composites on efficacy in treating osteomyelitis.
AB  == composites of gatifloxacin (gflx)-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (plga) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (betatcp) containing 0, 1, and 10 wt % gflx (0, 1,  and 10 wt % gflx composites), and gflx-loaded plga containing 1, 5, and 10 wt % gflx (1, 5, and 10wt % gflx-plga) as controls were fabricated and characterized in vitro and in vivo. on in vitro evaluation, the 10 wt % gflx composite released gflx over at least 28 days in hanks' balanced solution and exhibited clinically sufficient bactericidal activities against streptococcus milleri and bacteroides  fragilis from 1 h to 10 days. the 0, 1, and 10 wt % gflx composites and 10 wt % gflx-plga were implanted in bone defects created by debridement of osteomyelitis  lesions induced by s. milleri and b. fragilis in the mandible of rabbits (n = 5). four weeks after implantation of the 10 wt % gflx composite, inflammation in the  debrided area disappeared in all the rabbits, while inflammation remained in all  the rabbits after implantation of the 0 wt % gflx composite and 10 wt % gflx-plga, and in three rabbits after implantation of the 1 wt % gflx composite.  bone formation appears to be less intense for the 10 wt % gflx composite than for the 1 wt % gflx composite probably owing to the rapid degradation of the 10 wt %  gflx composite. these findings show that the gflx composite is effective for the  local treatment of osteomyelitis.

TI  == long-term monitoring of the human intestinal microbiota from the 2nd week to 13 years of age.
AB  == microbial contact begins prior to birth and continues rapidly thereafter. few long term follow-up studies have been reported and we therefore characterized the development of intestinal microbiota of ten subjects from the 2nd week of life to 13 years of age. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with several bacterial group-specific primer sets demonstrated the colonization steps  of defined bacterial groups in the microbiota. bifidobacterium species were seen  throughout the test period in all subjects. bacteroides fragilis group and blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale group species were not detected in several  subjects during the first 6 months of life but were commonly seen after 12 months of life. streptococcus group appeared during early life but was not seen in several subjects at the age of 13 years. although a few species were linked with  the increasing age, major bacterial species in the groups did not change dramatically. rather considerable changes were found in the relative abundances of each bacterial species. clustering analysis of total bacterial flora indicated that the microbiota changed considerably between 6 months and 12 months of life,  and, at the age of 12 months, the intestinal microbiota was already converted toward a profile characteristic of an adult microbiota. probiotic supplementation in the beginning of life did not have major impacts on later microbiota development.

TI  == distinct cytokine pattern in response to different bacterial pathogens in human brain abscess.
AB  == brain abscess is a focal suppurative process. host inflammatory response in gram  type and specific bacteria has not been studied in brain abscess. a total of 57 brain abscess patients with monomicrobial infections were studied for th1 (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il1-beta), th2 (il-4, il-10) and th17 (il-17, il-23) cytokine response by reverse-transcriptase pcr and elisa. th1 and th17 cytokines  were significantly elevated in gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus intermedius) and th2 cytokine (il-10) in gram negative (bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli) infections (p<0.05). cytokine levels were significantly higher in abscess than blood (p<0.001). elevated levels of several  inflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il1-beta, il-17 and il-23) were associated with the duration of symptoms; predisposing factors also influenced the levels of several cytokines. the expression of inflammatory cytokines in abscess was influenced by the bacterial pathogen, duration of symptoms and predisposing factors. local milieu of brain plays significant role in secretion of various cytokines.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == determination of disk diffusion and mic quality control guidelines for gsk2251052: a novel boron-containing antibacterial.
AB  == gsk2251052 is a boron-containing antimicrobial agent in clinical development for  the treatment of serious gram-negative bacterial infections. these gsk2251052 quality control (qc) studies were performed to establish ranges for control strains (broth microdilution [bmd] mic and disk diffusion zones) as follows: pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 (2-8 mug/ml and 15-24 mm), escherichia coli atcc 25922 (0.5-2 mug/ml and 23-30 mm), haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247 (0.25-1 mug/ml and 22-31 mm), streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619 (0.25-1 mug/ml and 19-28 mm), bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285 (1-4 mug/ml [bmd] and 1-4 mug/ml [agar dilution]), and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron atcc 29741 (1-8 mug/ml [bmd] and 2-8 mug/ml [agar dilution]). these ranges, approved by clinical and laboratory standards institute, will be crucial in accurately evaluating gsk2251052 in vitro potency.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == septic thrombophlebitis of the superior mesenteric vein with bacteraemia caused by bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus intermedius as a complication of diverculitis.
AB  == a 68-year-old japanese man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital because of fever and haematemesis. on day 3, his blood culture became positive for gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, and contrast-enhanced abdominal ct revealed acute septic thrombophlebitis of the superior mesenteric vein with caecal diverculitis. antimicrobial therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam and anticoagulant therapy were started and the blood culture grew bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus intermedius. on hospital day 7, the patient's condition began to improve in response to the therapy, therefore, the ampicillin-sulbactam and anticoagulant therapy was continued for 42 days. the patient was discharged home on hospital day 45. b fragilis bacteraemia of unknown source should caution the physician to search for an intra-abdominal focus, such  as thrombosis of the portal vein or mesenteric vein.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == the effect of environmental conditions on expression of bacteroides fragilis and  bacteroides thetaiotaomicron c10 protease genes.
AB  == background: bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are members of  the normal human intestinal microbiota. however, both organisms are capable of causing opportunistic infections, during which the environmental conditions to which the bacteria are exposed change dramatically. to further explore their potential for contributing to infection, we have characterized the expression in  b. thetaiotaomicron of four homologues of the gene encoding the c10 cysteine protease speb, a potent extracellular virulence factor produced by streptococcus  pyogenes. results: we identified a paralogous set of genes (btp genes) in the b.  thetaiotaomicron genome, that were related to c10 protease genes we recently identified in b. fragilis. similar to c10 proteases found in b. fragilis, three of the b. thetaiotaomicron homologues were transcriptionally coupled to genes encoding small proteins that are similar in structural architecture to staphostatins, protease inhibitors associated with staphopains in staphylococcus  aureus. the expression of genes for these c10 proteases in both b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron was found to be regulated by environmental stimuli, in particular by exposure to oxygen, which may be important for their contribution to the development of opportunistic infections. conclusions: genes encoding c10 proteases are increasingly identified in operons which also contain genes encoding proteins homologous to protease inhibitors. the bacteroides c10 protease gene expression levels are responsive to different environmental stimuli suggesting they may have distinct roles in the bacterial-host interaction.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

AB  == background: the c10 family of cysteine proteases includes enzymes that contribute to the virulence of bacterial pathogens, such as speb in streptococcus pyogenes.  the presence of homologues of cysteine protease genes in human commensal organisms has not been examined. bacteroides fragilis is a member of the dominant bacteroidetes phylum of the human intestinal microbiota, and is a significant opportunistic pathogen. results: four homologues of the streptococcal virulence factor speb were identified in the b. fragilis genome. these four protease genes, two were directly contiguous to open reading frames predicted to encode staphostatin-like inhibitors, with which the protease genes were co-transcribed.  two of these protease genes are unique to b. fragilis 638r and are associated with two large genomic insertions. gene annotation indicated that one of these insertions was a conjugative tn-like element and the other was a prophage-like element, which was shown to be capable of excision. homologues of the b. fragilis c10 protease genes were present in a panel of clinical isolates, and in dna extracted from normal human faecal microbiota. conclusions: this study suggests a mechanism for the evolution and dissemination of an important class of protease in major members of the normal human microbiota.

TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, ph, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. although several isolates of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterococcus, and the bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of escherichia coli, collinsela aerofaciense, eubacterium limosum, and clostridium perfringens could not. when fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. after the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of lactobacillus and streptococcus including enterococcus tended to increase. however, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including c. perfringens, decreased (p  < 0.05), and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas tended to decrease. moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. the fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p  < 0.05) on apple intake. these findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.

TI  == investigation into the controversial association of streptococcus gallolyticus with colorectal cancer and adenoma.
AB  == background: the seroprevalence of igg antibodies of streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, cip 105428, was evaluated to investigate the controversial association of s. gallolyticus with colorectal carcinoma and adenoma in attempt to investigate the nature of such association if any, by exploring the mrna expression of nf-kappab and il-8. moreover, the serological behavior of s. gallolyticus igg antibodies was compared to that of an indicator bacterium of bowel, bacteroides fragilis. methods: elisa was used to measure igg  antibodies of s. gallolyticus and b. fragilis in sera of 50 colorectal cancer, 14 colorectal adenoma patients, 30 age- and sex- matched apparently healthy volunteers (hv) and 30 age- and sex- matched colonoscopically-proven tumor-free control subjects. nf-kappab and il-8 mrna expression was evaluated in tumorous and non-tumorous tissue sections of carcinoma and adenoma patients in comparison  with that of control subjects by using in situ hybridization assay. results: colorectal cancer and adenoma patients were associated with higher levels of serum s. gallolyticus igg antibodies in comparison with hv and control subjects (p < 0.05) while no similar association was found with serum igg antibodies of b. fragilis (p > 0.05). elisa cutoff value for the seropositivity of s. gallolyticus igg was calculated from tumor-free control group. the expression of nf-kappab mrna was higher in tumorous than non-tumorous tissue sections of adenoma and carcinoma, higher in carcinoma/adenoma sections than in control subjects, higher  in tumorous sections of carcinoma than in adenoma patients, and higher in s. gallolyticus igg seropositive than in seronegative groups in both tumorous and non-tumorous sections (p < 0.05). il-8 mrna expression in tumorous sections of adenoma and carcinoma was higher than in non-tumorous sections, higher in carcinoma/adenoma than in control subjects, and higher in s. gallolyticus igg seropositive than in seronegative groups in tumorous rather than non-tumorous sections (p < 0.05). conclusion: s. gallolyticus most likely plays an essential role in the oncogenic progression of normal colorectal mucosa to adenoma and to crc. this promoting/propagating role of s. gallolyticus might take place by utilizing certain inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenic factors of transformation including nf-kappab and il-8.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == bsac standardized disc susceptibility testing method (version 8).
AB  == there have been considerable changes to the format of the recommendations since the previous version (version 7). the majority of the footnotes to the tables have been removed and the notations added to the end column; it is hoped that this change will avoid confusion in interpretation. antibiotics have been separated into groups, e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc. recommendations for urinary tract infections (utis) have been removed for most agents except for  those that are administered solely for the treatment of uncomplicated utis or where there are limited recommendations for specific organisms, e.g. trimethoprim. for agents that previously had dual recommendations, systemic recommendations remain and the intermediate category can be used for interpretation for utis because intermediate susceptibility infers that the infection may respond as the agent is concentrated at the site of infection. this change will also avoid errors in interpretation when an organism is isolated from multiple sites, e.g. blood and urine. the changes that have been made to version  7 are as follows: mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for trimethoprim, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin for utis (table 7); mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for doripenem (tables 7-9); colistin mic bps for pseudomonas spp. (table 9), co-trimoxazole mic bps for stenotrophomonas maltophilia (table 10); staphylococci mic and zone diameter bps for clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trimethoprim uti, nitrofurantoin uti and rifampicin (table 11); streptococcus pneumoniae mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, linezolid, rifampicin and telithromycin (table 12); addition of streptomycin recommendations for enterococci (table 13); enterococcal mic and zone diameter bps for quinupristin/dalfopristin, nitrofurantoin uti and trimethoprim uti (table 13); beta-haemolytic streptococci mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and telithromycin (table 15); clarithromycin and erythromycin mic and zone diameter bps for moraxella catarrhalis (table 16); azithromycin mic bps for neisseria gonorrhoeae (table 17); chloramphenicol and rifampicin mic bps for neisseria meningitidis (table 18); azithromycin mic bps for haemophilus influenzae (table 19); mic bps for metronidazole for bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and clostridium perfringens (tables 23-25, respectively); susceptibility testing of listeria spp. (appendix 3); the acceptable range for atcc 25923 to a 10 microg tobramycin disc (table 26).

TI  == streptococcus milleri group isolates from blood cultures: consider surgical sepsis.
AB  == background: streptococcus milleri group bacteria (smg) frequently are involved in purulent infections, often resulting in abscess formation with a high recurrence  rate. blood stream infections with these organisms are infrequent. patients and methods: review of epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of smg-related bacteremia. results: during a four-year period, 637 smg-positive samples from 475 patients, including 45 positive blood cultures from 25 patients (7.1%), were identified. in one pediatric patient, the smg was a contaminant, so 24 patients (5.1%) with 44 positive blood cultures (6.9%) were available for further evaluation. the study group consisted of 17 male and seven female patients with a median age of 56 years and a median hospital stay of 23 days (range 8-83 days). in 21 patients, monomicrobial smg blood stream infection was found, whereas in three patients, polymicrobial infection was diagnosed (coagulase-negative staphylococci in two, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in one). the source of the organism in the blood was intra-abdominal infection in six cases, soft tissue infection in another six cases, and cardiovascular and nervous system infection in three cases each. in the remaining cases, miscellaneous sources were identified. in 14 infected patients (58.3%), surgical interventions were performed before smg bacteremia was diagnosed. all patients received antibiotic treatment with a median duration of 11.5 d (range 6-25 d). five patients died, but no death was related directly to smg infection. conclusions: sepsis with smg  is in most cases associated with surgical infection. source control together with directed antibiotic therapy leads to an acceptable outcome. immunosuppression and significant co-morbidities are common in patients with this type of infection.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == group milleri streptococci in perianal infections.
AB  == background: anal abscesses are commonly associated with fistulas-in-ano and are usually polymicrobial in nature, with gram-negative rods and anaerobes being the  most prevalent isolates. group milleri streptococci (gms) comprise a heterogeneous group of cocci, which are capable of causing severe purulent infection with a high recurrence rate. method: all anorectal infections caused by gms, which were identified at our centre during a 4-year period were retrospectively analysed. the 18 patients with gms-positive anorectal abscesses were matched with 36 gms-negative anorectal abscesses to identify outcome characteristics of this clinical entity. results: during the study period, 358 patients underwent surgical treatment for anal infections; gms were isolated in 46 individuals (13%) including 18 perianal abscesses, 11 pilonidal sinuses, eight fistulae in and nine miscellaneous infections. seventy-two per cent of perianal gms infections were polymicrobial with e. coli and bacteroides fragilis being the predominant second bacteria. nine patients (20%) developed recurrent abscesses and fistulae-in-ano and underwent additional surgical interventions with resolution at follow-up. additional antibiotic treatment was administered in 10 patients with complex anal infections. matched pair analysis revealed that gms-positive perianal abscesses were more commonly polymicrobial, and that the recurrence rate was higher (55.6% gms-positive and 22.2% gms-negative patients, p = 0.017). conclusions: our data confirm the propensity of gms to form deep and recurrent abscesses with a higher recurrence rate than non-gms infections. first-line treatment includes surgical drainage, and antibiotic treatment may be  useful in selected patients.

TI  == in situ replacement with equine pericardial roll grafts for ruptured infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta.
AB  == we describe surgical in situ replacement using an equine pericardial roll to treat ruptured infected abdominal aortic aneurysms (aaa) in two patients. a 78-year-old man diagnosed with ruptured infected (bacteroides fragilis) aaa underwent in situ replacement of the abdominal aorta using a bifurcated equine pericardial roll graft with concomitant omentum flap wrapping. a 50-year-old man  diagnosed with ruptured infected (streptococcus agalactiae) aaa underwent the same procedure, except the graft was straight. computed tomography of this patient revealed no graft dilation or surrounding fluid accumulation at 48 months after surgery. we therefore suggest that in situ replacement of the abdominal aorta using equine pericardium with concomitant omental flap wrapping may be an option of treating ruptured infected aaas.

TI  == group milleri streptococci in paediatric infections.
AB  == background: group milleri streptococci (gms), a subgroup of viridans streptococci, are commensals of the human respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. gms tend to cause purulent infections often resulting in abscess formation. little is known about the significance of these organisms in children. patients and methods: for this retrospective study, a collection of 636 gms positive isolates from 475 patients was used to identify 39 (8.2 %) paediatric patients (age < 18 years) with gms infections (46 isolates) during a four-year period. results: there were 19 intra-abdominal, eleven dental/oropharyngeal, seven soft tissue and two central nervous system infections. thirty-five patients (95 %) underwent primary surgical interventions. furthermore, two patients - one with gms meningitis that progressed to cerebral empyema and another with a liver abscess - initially treated with antibiotic agents alone eventually required surgical intervention to cure the infection. only two children were treated with antibiotics alone. polymicrobial infection was found in 22 (48 %) isolates; polymicrobial infection was most common in patients with intra-abdominal infection with 74 % and lowest in dental/oropharyngeal patients with 9 % (p = 0.001); escherichia coli (n = 9) and  bacteroides fragilis (n = 9) were the most common secondary pathogens. complications due to gms infections were found in five cases (13 %). no patient died from gms infection. preferred antibiotics were penicillins (56 %) and cephalosporins (37 %). gms tested susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins, carbapenems in 100 % and clindamycin in 93 %. conclusions: gms infections in paediatric patients usually require both antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. these infections may become life-threatening if not diagnosed in a timely fashion and treated aggressively.

AB  == a composite of poly-epsilon-caprolactone (pcl) loaded with gatifloxacine (gflx),  an antibiotic, and a beta-tricalcium phosphate (betatcp) porous ceramic body was  prepared by a solvent-free process in which no toxic solvent was used. gflx mostly retained its bactericidal property after the processing. the composite of  gflx-loaded pcl and betatcp ceramic released gflx for 4 weeks in hanks' balanced  solution, and had sustained bactericidal activity against streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis for at least 1 week. the composite of the gflx-loaded pcl and betatcp ceramic was implanted in an osteomyelitis lesion induced by s. milleri and b. fragilis in the rabbit mandible. the osteomyelitis lesion expanded in the mesial-distal direction when no composite was implanted or when the lesion was treated with debridement only. the composite of gflx-loaded pcl and betatcp showed efficacy in controlling infection at the bone defect formed by debridement, and supported bone tissue reconstruction at the bone defect. twelve  and 50 weeks after the implantation, the inflammation even disappeared. new bone  formation was observed on the surface of the composite after 4 weeks. after 50 weeks, ingrowth of bone tissues with vascular channels was observed along the pcl and betatcp interface, which indicated degradation of pcl and/or betatcp ceramic  at the ceramic/polymer interface followed by replacement by bone tissues. the gflx concentrations in the serum and soft tissues were very low. therefore, the composite of gflx-loaded pcl and betatcp ceramic would help arrest osteomyelitis  when it is used in addition to intravenous antibiotic administration, and help new bone formation and osteoconduction.

AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  == carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly gram-negative population to one dominated by gram-positive bacteria. the objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to fish using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic eubmix probe. additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. furthermore, lactobacilli, enterobacteriaceae, allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, mitsuokella jalaludinii and clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in italy for treatment of canine infections. of the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by peptostreptococcus + porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin  + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics  tested. the emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.

TI  == a review of new fluoroquinolones : focus on their use in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the new respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and on the horizon, garenoxacin) offer many improved qualities over older agents such as ciprofloxacin. these include retaining excellent activity against gram-negative bacilli, with improved gram-positive activity (including streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus). in addition, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and garenoxacin all demonstrate increased anaerobic activity (including activity against bacteroides fragilis). the new fluoroquinolones possess greater bioavailability and longer serum half-lives compared with ciprofloxacin. the new fluoroquinolones allow for once-daily administration, which may improve patient adherence. the high bioavailability allows for rapid step down from intravenous administration to oral therapy, minimizing unnecessary hospitalization, which may decrease costs and improve quality of life of patients. clinical trials involving the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections (acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia) demonstrate high bacterial eradication rates and clinical cure rates. in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, the various new fluoroquinolones appear to be comparable to each other, but may be more effective than macrolide or cephalosporin-based regimens. however, additional data are required before it can be emphatically stated that the new fluoroquinolones as a class are responsible for better outcomes than comparators in community-acquired respiratory infections. gemifloxacin (except for higher rates of hypersensitivity), levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have relatively mild adverse effects that are more or less comparable to ciprofloxacin. in our opinion, gatifloxacin should not be used, due to glucose alterations which may be serious. although all new fluoroquinolones react with metal ion-containing drugs (antacids), other drug interactions are relatively mild compared with ciprofloxacin. the new fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have  much to offer in terms of bacterial eradication, including activity against resistant respiratory pathogens such as penicillin-resistant, macrolide-resistant, and multidrug-resistant s. pneumoniae. however, ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, including ciprofloxacin-resistant s. pneumoniae, are becoming more prevalent, thus prudent use must be exercised when  prescribing these valuable agents.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == [psoas abscesses. an up-dated perspective].
AB  == objective: to analyze the characteristics of abscesses of the psoas muscle and assess the differences between pyogenic and tuberculous abscesses. methods: retrospective descriptive study of all patients with psoas abscess in our hospital over the period 1994 to 2004. results: fourteen patients were studied (10 males), with a mean age of 42 years. half of them had had an underlying disease. the most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (64%), fever (57%), and back pain (43%). all the abscesses were secondary. in 7 patients the origin was gastrointestinal, in 6 osteoarticular, and 1 was related with infection of an aortobifemoral bypass. computed tomography was the diagnostic imaging method in all patients. culture of drainage specimens was positive in 92% of patients undergoing this procedure. causal microorganisms included mycobacterium tuberculosis (5), streptococcus intermedius (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), escherichia coli (3) and bacteroides fragilis (2). tuberculous abscesses originated in spondylitis and the clinical presentation was longer prior to diagnosis. drainage was performed in 12 patients (8 percutaneous and 4 surgical). mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 4 weeks. the infection resolved in all patients. conclusions: psoas abscess commonly had a gastrointestinal and osteoarticular origin. we underscore the high percentage of  tuberculous etiology, which had a more insidious clinical and analytical presentation and was usually secondary to spondylitis. prolonged antimicrobial treatment associated with drainage was effective therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of clove and thyme extracts.
AB  == objective: it has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. this study examine two samples of clove obtained from sri lanka and zanzibar and two samples of thyme from iran and oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. method: the active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. the antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium species, salmonella species, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans. results: all oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested.  their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against s. aureus. the lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using candida albicans. there was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from sri lanka or zanzibar or thyme obtained from iran or oman. conclusion: our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. however, further work is necessary to ascertain why candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  == background: for its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. to avoid the interaction of  the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (cpm) to induce neutropenia. although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. methods: fifteen female icr mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of cpm on days 1 and 4, respectively. blood samples (approximately 160 microl) were  drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of wright-stained smears. the impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (s. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (s. aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis). results: the basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. on day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. conclusion: a cpm total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. they often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. the original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group  peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. the treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology,  and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin: the role of 3 newer fluoroquinolones.
AB  == gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin are the newest fluoroquinolones and  show excellent in vitro activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract pathogens, many gram-negative aerobic organisms, and bacteroides fragilis. these  agents may be administered as oral and/or intravenous formulations with excellent bioavailability. the pharmacodynamics of these 3 new fluoroquinolones is more favorable than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for streptococcus pneumoniae. all 3 agents are approved for the treatment of acute exacerbation of  chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. in addition, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved for the treatment of sinusitis. the toxicity of these 3 agents appears to be similar to that of the other fluoroquinolones in terms of gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances. all 3 agents have a low risk of phototoxicity, but gemifloxacin is associated with an increased risk of skin rash that is not a photoreaction. these agents can be useful for treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams, but caution must be exercised to avoid the potential for selection of widespread resistance, which may occur with indiscriminate use.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem (mk-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 enterobacteriaceae, 15 aeromonas spp., 42 staphylococcus spp., 43 streptococcus spp., 15 enterococcus spp., 30 haemophilus  spp., 15 moraxella catarrhalis, 12 neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 clostridium spp., 12 peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group bacteroides recovered from four spanish hospitals. ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae  (mic(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded ampc betalactamase-producing strains. ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (mic(90) > or =16 mg/l). ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) < or =1 mg/l). in the case of haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a mic(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. when considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against clostridium spp. (mic(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l). both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.

TI  == activity of faropenem and imipenem for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.
AB  == aim: to determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. methods: the mics were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. results: faropenem was very active against escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/l for inhibition. of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem mic higher than that associated with the  other isolates of the same species. conclusions: faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. there was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin  and faropenem or imipenem resistance.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == microbiologic profile of intra-abdominal infections at belo horizonte, brazil.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) represent one of the most common clinical problems in hospital practice, especially in surgical areas and centers of intensive care. the treatment of iais generally involves the draining of abscesses and empirical antimicrobial therapy. in this study, among 150 patients  suffering from iai, 106 (70.7%) yielded samples that presented microbial growth.  polyinfection was detected in 51.9% of the cases and varied from 2 to 9 distinct  microbes per specimen. the overall mean number of micro-organisms isolated per patient was 2.17. aerobic bacteria (as strict aerobes and facultative anaerobes), strict anaerobic bacteria, and fungi of the genus candida represented 93.4%, 30.2%, and 13.2% of the cases positive for micro-organisms, respectively. the most common aerobic bacteria were those of the genera staphylococcus, escherichia, proteus, and streptococcus. despite the frequent prior use (52%) with antimicrobials of recognized action against strict anaerobes, these micro-organisms constituted 30.9% of the total isolates, and the most frequently  found were of the bacteroides fragilis group and prevotella species. the high prevalence of anaerobes in the specimens obtained from iai demonstrates the need  to give greater importance to these micro-organisms by making available material  and human resources to carry out culture of the anaerobes as part of routine hospital procedures.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == multiloculated pyogenic brain abscess: experience in 25 patients.
AB  == objective: to report our experience in treating multiloculated pyogenic brain abscess and determine whether there are differences in the bacteriology, predisposing factors, treatment choices, and outcomes between multiloculated and  uniloculated brain abscesses. methods: we studied clinical data collected during  a 16-year period from 124 patients with pyogenic brain abscess, including 25 cases of multiloculated abscess. results: the incidence of multiloculated brain abscess was 20%. in these 25 patients, hematogenous spread from a remote infectious focus was the most common cause of infection, as it was for the cases  of uniloculated abscess. headache and hemiparesis were the most common symptoms in patients with multiloculated abscess. in patients with uniloculated abscess, fever was the most common symptom. viridans streptococci were the most commonly isolated pathogens. bacteroides fragilis was the most common anaerobe in multiloculated abscess, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli were the most common pathogens in patients with uniloculated abscess. of the patients with multiloculated abscess, 21 were treated surgically and 4 were treated with antibiotics only. overall, eight patients (38%) needed another operation because  of abscess recurrence after the initial operation. in uniloculated abscess, the rate of abscess recurrence after initial surgery was 13.1%. mortality was 16% in  multiloculated abscess and 17.1% in uniloculated abscess. conclusion: multiloculated abscesses accounted for 20% of our patients with pyogenic brain abscess. excision seems to be the more appropriate surgical choice in multiloculated abscess. prognosis for patients with multiloculated abscess can be as good as that for patients with uniloculated abscess. however, clinicians must  carefully monitor these patients because the possibility of recurrence after surgery is significantly higher in patients with multiloculated abscess than in those with uniloculated abscess.

TI  == transposon-induced norfloxacin-sensitive mutants of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  == to elucidate the mechanism of norfloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) resistance of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of the b. fragilis group, we isolated transposon-induced mutants sensitive to this agent using tn4351. four norfloxacin-sensitive mutants showed reduced levels of resistance, at least, to ethidium bromide. cloning and sequencing of three chromosomal fragments adjacent  to tn4351 from the mutants revealed that two partial open reading frames (orfs) were disrupted by a transposon. amino acid sequences of partial orf products had  strong homologies to those of escherichia coli recb and b. ovatus transketolase.  two mutants carried a recb homolog inserted by tn4351 together with r751 (cointegration) and by itself (simple transposition) at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions, respectively. since mutations in recb produce e. coli cells sensitive to dna-damaging treatments by quinolones, it is concluded that decreases of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the agents for b. thetaiotaomicron resulted from disruption of the recb homolog. another mutant carried a transketolase gene inserted by tn4351. there is no reasonable explanation why disruption of the transketolase gene caused a decrease of the mic of norfloxacin for this organism, although streptococcus pneumoniae recp related  to dna recombination was reported to be transketolase.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1999  and march 2000].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. in this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from april 1999 to march 2000) have been summarized. two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among gram-positive aerobes, peptostreptococcus prevotii among gram-positive anaerobes, e. coli among gram-negative aerobes, and bacteroides fragilis among gram-negative anaerobes. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. in postoperative infections, the percentage  of gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. methicillin-resistant s. aureus accounted for 70.7% of s. aureus (41 strains). either the number of strain or the percentage of mrsa decreased. the susceptibilities of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. the susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. s. aureus showed  good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == microbiology and management of post-surgical wounds infection in children.
AB  == the recent increased recovery of anaerobic bacteria from children has led to greater appreciation of their role in paediatric infections at all body sites, including post-surgical wounds (psw). in studies that employed adequate method for recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria polymicrobial, aerobic and anaerobes were isolated from over half of the patients with psw. the wounds studied were those that developed following these surgical procedures: head and neck surgery for malignancies, post-thoracotomy, spinal fusion and gastrostomy tube insertion. staphylococcus aureus and aerobic gram-negative bacilli were found at all sites. however, a correlation was generally found between the site of the wounds and microbial flora recovered from the wound. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the surgical site predominated in the wound next to these areas. enteric gram-negative rods, group d enterococcus and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in wounds relating to the gut flora, while streptococcus spp., pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in wounds proximal to the oral  area. management of psw should include administration of antimicrobials effective against the polymicrobial bacterial flora adjacent to the anatomic site of the wound.

TI  == a unique structural pattern shared by t-cell-activating and abscess-regulating zwitterionic polysaccharides.
AB  == in contrast to the conventional dogma that carbohydrates are poorly immunogenic t-cell-independent antigens, zwitterionic polysaccharides (zpss) can significantly stimulate t-cell proliferation and regulate abscess formation in bacterial infection. despite their similar biological activities, zpss from various bacteria are greatly different in primary chemical compositions and building block linkages. to identify the common structural features that govern the peculiar immunologic activity of zpss, we have been determining three-dimensional structures of compositionally different zpss by nmr spectroscopy and molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. we report here the conformation of type 1 capsular polysaccharide from the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae (sp1) to be a right-handed helix with repeated zwitterionically charged grooves. we also report the striking similarity between  the structures of sp1 and our previously determined ps a2 from bacteroides fragilis. these results support our hypothesis that t-cell-activating zpss assume similar conformational and charge patterns that are recognized by specific receptors and that account for their common property as t-cell activators.

TI  == zwitterionic polysaccharides stimulate t cells by mhc class ii-dependent interactions.
AB  == polysaccharides of pathogenic extracellular bacteria commonly have negatively charged groups or no charged groups at all. these molecules have been considered  classic t cell-independent ags that do not elicit cell-mediated immune responses  in mice. however, bacterial polysaccharides with a zwitterionic charge motif (zpss), such as the capsular polysaccharides of many strains of bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 elicit potent cd4(+) t cell responses in vivo and in vitro. the cell-mediated response to zps depends on the presence of both positively charged and negatively charged  groups on each repeating unit of the polysaccharide. in this study, we define some of the requirements for the presentation of zps to cd4(+) t cells. we provide evidence that direct interactions of t cells with apcs are essential for  t cell activation by zps. monocytes, dendritic cells, and b cells are all able to serve as apcs for zps-mediated t cell activation. apcs lacking mhc class ii molecules do not support this activity. furthermore, mab to hla-dr specifically blocks zps-mediated t cell activation, while mabs to other mhc class ii and class i molecules do not. immunoprecipitation of lysates of mhc class ii-expressing cells following incubation with zps shows binding of zps and hla-dr. electron microscopy reveals colocalization of zps with hla-dr on the cell surface and in compartments of the endocytic pathway. these results indicate that mhc class ii molecules expressing hla-dr on professional apcs are required for zps-induced t cell activation. the implication is that binding of zps to hla-dr may be required for t cell activation.

AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

AB  == a major objective for domestic wastewater treatment using waste stabilization pond systems is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms. traditional evaluation  parameters for faecal contamination are the total and faecal coliforms. however,  epidemiological studies, environmental resistance and the behaviour in the treatment systems, show that viruses are an important disease agent and even more resistant to disinfection than bacteria. therefore, it is important to introduce  viruses as a faecal indicator and to compare them with the traditional bacterial  indicators. a waste stabilization pond system was evaluated in the municipality of choconta, cundinamarca (colombia), for the removal of faecal indicators (such  as escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens) and viruses like f+, somatic and bacteroides fragilis phages. the system includes two facultative ponds in series with a flow of 1555 m3/day. samples were collected at the entrance of the system, in the two ponds and from the final effluent. results show a decrease between 0.3 and 4.7 logarithmic units in the bacterial indicators and between 1 and 4.6 logarithmic units with viral indicators.

AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == a critical review of the fluoroquinolones: focus on respiratory infections.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) offer excellent activity against gram-negative bacilli and improved gram-positive activity (e.g. against streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. ciprofloxacin still maintains the best in vitro activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (e.g. bacteroides fragilis) versus ciprofloxacin. all  of the new fluoroquinolones display excellent bioavailability and have longer serum half-lives than ciprofloxacin allowing for once daily dose administration.  clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones to each other or to standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of community-acquired respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis). limited data suggest that the new fluoroquinolones as a class may lead to better outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis versus comparators. several of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market, had their use severely restricted because of adverse effects (clinafloxacin because of phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia; grepafloxacin because of prolongation of the qtc and resultant torsades de pointes; sparfloxacin because of phototoxicity; and trovafloxacin because of hepatotoxicity), or were discontinued during developmental phases. the remaining fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have adverse effect profiles similar to ciprofloxacin. extensive post-marketing safety surveillance data (as are available with ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) are required for all new fluoroquinolones before safety can be definitively established. drug interactions are limited; however, all fluoroquinolones interact with metal ion containing drugs (eg. antacids). the new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) offer several advantages over ciprofloxacin and are emerging as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections. their broad spectrum of activity which includes respiratory pathogens such as penicillin and macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, favourable pharmacokinetic parameters, good bacteriological and clinical efficacy will lead to growing use of these agents in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis. these agents may result  in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. prudent use of the new fluoroquinolones will be required to minimise the development of resistance to these agents.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objective: we studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections.  methods: human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. after 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-8 (il-8), and interleukin-10 (il-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. expression of cytokine mrnas was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). results: in nonstimulated cultures, low (il-1beta and tnf-alpha) and high (il-6, il-8, and il-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. the pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and il-10, whereas tnf-alpha secretion was not elevated. e coli was the most potent inducer followed by b fragilis, s agalactiae, s aureus, and m hominis. transcripts encoding il-1beta, il-6, il-8, or il-10 were elevated in the rt-pcr reactions, suggesting  that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. conclusion: pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mrna expression and polypeptide  release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.

TI  == group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia characterized by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == little is known about the relative importance of the four species of lancefield group g beta-hemolytic streptococci in causing bacteremia and the factors that determine the outcome for patients with group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia. from 1997 to 2000, 75 group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains were isolated from the blood cultures of 66 patients. sequencing of the 16s rrna  genes of the group g beta-hemolytic streptococci showed that all 75 isolates were streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis. the api system (20 strep) and  vitek system (gpi) successfully identified 65 (98.5%) and 62 (93.9%) isolates, respectively, as s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence, whereas the atb expression system (id32 strep) only successfully identified 49 isolates (74.2%) as s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence.  the median age of the patients was 76 years (range, 33 to 99 years). fifty-six patients (85%) were over 60 years old. all patients had underlying diseases. no source of the bacteremia was identified (primary bacteremia) in 34 patients (52%), whereas 17 (26%) had cellulitis and 8 (12%) had bed sore or wound infections. fifty-eight patients (88%) had community-acquired group g streptococcal bacteremia. sixty-two patients (94%) had group g streptococcus recovered in one blood culture, whereas 4 patients (6%) had it recovered in multiple blood cultures. fifty-nine patients (89%) had group g streptococcus as the only bacterium recovered in their blood cultures, whereas in 7 patients other bacteria were recovered concomitantly with the group g streptococcus in the blood cultures (staphylococcus aureus in 3, clostridium perfringens in 2, citrobacter freundii in 1, and bacteroides fragilis in 1). overall, 10 patients (15%) died. male sex, diagnosis other than cellulitis, hospital-acquired bacteremia, and multiple positive blood cultures were associated with mortality [p < 0.005 (relative risk [rr] = 7.6), p < 0.05 (rr = 3.7), p < 0.005 (rr = 5.6), and p < 0.05 (rr = 5.6), respectively]. unlike group c beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia is not a zoonotic infection in hong kong.

TI  == the yield of blood cultures in a department of emergency medicine.
AB  == this study sought to determine the yield of blood cultures drawn in the department of emergency medicine. the results of 730 blood cultures taken from 718 patients were retrospectively analysed. the total percentage of positive cultures was 9.7%. only 3.4% of the blood cultures were classified as true bacteraemia and the rest as contaminants. the commonest type of isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (49%), which were considered contaminants in all cases. other contaminants represented 13.2% of all the positive blood cultures. the following bacteria comprised the group of true bacteraemia: escherichia coli  (12.6%), streptococcus pneumoniae (9.8%), viridans streptococci (7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.8%), bacteroides fragilis (2.8%), moraxella species (1.4%) and flavobacterium species (1.4%). blood cultures were positive in 3.6% of patients with pneumonia and in 10% of patients with urinary tract infections. in  patients with fever of unclear source blood cultures were positive in 3.1% of children between 0-36 months of age and in 1.1% of patients older than 16 years.  as a whole, patients with positive blood cultures were clinically sicker, a higher percentage of them required admission to the hospital and had higher temperatures or rapidly fatal disease, compared with the group of patients with negative blood cultures. in order to improve the yield of blood cultures in febrile patients, first, better a priori identification of those subjects at high risk for bacteraemia will reduce the number of unnecessary blood cultures and second, sterile venipuncture techniques should be improved in order to reduce the number of contaminants.

TI  == early diagnosis of retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == objective: to report survival of retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis in an inmunocompromised patient and to demonstrate early clinical signs that may help in the prompt diagnosis and treatment of this severe infection. design: case report and literature review. setting: an adult, 18-bed intensive care unit within a university hospital. patient: a 38-yr-old man who had undergone an uncomplicated closed hemorrhoidectomy was readmitted to the hospital on postoperative day 5 for erythema around the hemorrhoidectomy and a dirty brown discharge from the wound. interventions: early diagnosis of retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis, wide and repeated debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and eventual abdominal wall reconstruction. measurements and main results: this patient manifested periumbilical and bilateral flank erythema, reminiscent of the pattern of ecchymosis seen in cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. the findings demonstrate a variation of cullen's and grey turner's sign, most often found in patients with hemorrhagic pancreatitis. an abdominal radiograph revealed a ground glass appearance with radiolucency outlining the bladder, consistent with retroperitoneal air. the chest radiograph showed mediastinal air extending into the neck. sharp debridement of the retroperitoneal fat, the right anterior rectus sheath, and the right anterior thigh fascia was required to gain control of the infection. operative cultures grew a mixed flora with eschericha coli, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and bacteroides fragilis predominating. the hospital course was complicated by hemodynamic instability, renal failure, pneumonia, and a pelvic abscess. the patient ultimately survived and underwent abdominal wall reconstruction with mesh. conclusion: retroperitoneal necrotizing  fasciitis is an uncommon soft tissue infection that is often fatal. early diagnosis in this case was facilitated by the unique clinical findings of a modified cullen's and grey turner's sign. a review of the limited available literature suggests that survival of retroperitoneal fasciitis is possible with prompt debridement and antibiotic therapy.

TI  == analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
AB  == a theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. bacteria (streptococcus sobrinus hg1025, streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, bacteroides fragilis 793e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 974k) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)  was reached. for s. sobrinus hg1025, s. oralis j22, and a. naeslundii t14v-j1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for b. fragilis 793e and p. aeruginosa 974k, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. for some experimental conditions, like with p. aeruginosa 974k adhering to dds-coated glass and an air  bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. the detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain  and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. however, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. at low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high  air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. the shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. the present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms.  hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  == background and aims: altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. we investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. methods: a colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to  the abdominal wall through two colostomies. the loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop  was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. results: colonisation with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. colonisation with lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. conclusions: certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == isolation of eikenella corrodens from polymicrobial hepatic abscess: report of one case.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a rare cause of hepatic abscess. we report a case of a hepatic abscess caused by (1) bacteroides fragilis, (2) streptococcus constellatus and (3) e. corrodens, which illustrates potential problems of antibiotic coverage due to the presence of eikenella species. the infection followed an episode of acute gastroenteritis and the clinical course appeared indolent evolving over one week. besides empirical antibiotics, initial percutaneous aspiration was performed and yielded pus which grew e. corrodens concomitantly with streptococcus species. e. corrodens was sensitive to penicillin but resistant to clindamycin and metronidazole. but b. fragilis was resistant to penicillin. so the antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin/clavulanate. unfortunately fever persisted and the abscess increased  in size. therefore echo-guided percutaneous drainage with pigtail catheter was installed. fever subsided 5 days later. after 21 days treatment of antibiotics, the patient was discharged in good condition despite having some sterile fluid in the residual abscess cavity. two months after discharge the follow-up echogram confirmed complete resolution of the residual abscess. this patient shows us the  existence of e. corrodens in pediatric patients, especially when the hepatic abscess is very likely from the spread of an oral or abdominal infection.

TI  == microbiology of infected poison ivy dermatitis.
AB  == we report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected poison ivy dermatitis. the study involved retrospective review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records of patients with secondarily infected poison ivy  lesions. bacterial growth was noted in 33 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 18 (55%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (21%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic bacteria in eight (24%). forty-five isolates were recovered (1.4 per specimen): 27 aerobic or facultative  anaerobic bacteria, and 18 strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (13 isolates) and group a beta-haemolytic streptococci (six). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (seven isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas  spp. (four) and fusobacterium spp. (two). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 18 (55%) patients, eight of which were s. aureus. nineteen of the organisms isolated from 16 (48%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated  in those infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in leg and buttock lesions. group a beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered from lesions of the finger, face and neck. the polymicrobial aetiology of secondarily infected poison ivy lesions, and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the lesions, are demonstrated.

TI  == t cells activated by zwitterionic molecules prevent abscesses induced by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == immunologic paradigms classify bacterial polysaccharides as t cell-independent antigens. however, these models fail to explain how zwitterionic polysaccharides  (zps) confer protection against intraabdominal abscess formation in a t cell-dependent manner. here, we demonstrate that zps elicit a potent cd4+ t cell  response in vitro that requires available major histocompatibility complex class  ii molecules on antigen-presenting cells. specific chemical modifications to zps  show that: 1) the activity is specific for carbohydrate structure, and 2) the proliferative response depends upon free amino and carboxyl groups on the repeating units of these polysaccharides. peptides synthesized to mimic the zwitterionic charge motif associated with zps also exhibited these biologic properties. lysine-aspartic acid (kd) peptides with more than 15 repeating units  stimulated cd4+ t cells in vitro and conferred protection against abscesses induced by bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus. evidence for the biologic importance of t cell activation by these zwitterionic polymers was provided when human cd4+ t cells stimulated with these molecules in  vitro and adoptively transferred to rats in vivo conferred protection against intraabdominal abscesses induced by viable bacterial challenge. these studies demonstrate that bacterial polysaccharides with a distinct charge motif activate  t cells and that this activity confers immunity to a distinct pathologic response to bacterial infection.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being serratia spp. (mic(90) 1 mg/l) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/l. gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis being  inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were highly susceptible (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) but mrsa less susceptible (mic(90) 8 mg/l) to gemifloxacin. enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. gemifloxacin showed good activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and anaerobic cocci. a tentative in-vitro breakpoint  of 0.5 mg/l was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. the false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered  acceptable. in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == microbiological examinations and in-vitro testing of different antibiotics in therapeutic endoscopy of the biliary system.
AB  == background and study aims: prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. in addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. patients and methods: ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction  who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (ptcd) were included. sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary  drainage. aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. in the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. results: the incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. twelve different microorganisms were detected, with escherichia coli found in four cases. from 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. a single agent was detected in  eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). the seven most frequently isolated germs  were e. coli and enterococcus (each n = 19), klebsiella (n = 10), streptococcus viridans (n = 9), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), morganella morganii (n = 4), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (ppis), with a consequent rise in the gastric ph value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on ppis (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). in-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin  (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). conclusions: escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. enterococci, klebsiella and streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. in view of  the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.

(5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == am-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the  antibacterial activity of am-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. the in vivo efficacy of am-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (e. coli and b. fragilis) model of rats. the accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in  the am-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent am-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. these included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses.  a total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). the predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were escherichia coli (60 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (20), streptococcus group d (19), and staphylococcus aureus (11). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (66), prevotella species (22), and clostridium species (22). the number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. the number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. these data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.

TI  == cell-free whey from milk fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  == the ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. in the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with streptococcus thermophilus and b. breve c50 and given to 10 control subjects. nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk  indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. fecal excretion of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of b. breve whey. fecal ph was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with bif. breve.  fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. the results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to  modify intestinal flora of humans. repression of b. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.

TI  == comparison of roxithromycin with co-amoxiclav in patients with sinusitis.
AB  == in an open, randomized study of 60 patients with acute or recurrent sinusitis, the bacteriological and clinical efficacy of roxithromycin 150 mg bd were compared with those of po co-amoxiclav (625 mg) tds. of 52 patients who underwent sinus puncture for isolation of causative organisms, 48 had pathogens sensitive to both antibiotics. satisfactory clinical response was obtained in 93.1% (27/29) evaluable patients receiving roxithromycin and 88.8% (24/27) receiving co-amoxiclav. tolerability was significantly better in the roxithromycin group, with 1/29 (3.4%) patients in this group experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects, compared with 7/27 (25.9%) patients in the co-amoxiclav group (p <  0.05). although the study had limited power to detect differences, roxithromycin  demonstrated clinical, bacteriological and overall efficacy similar to that of co-amoxiclav, but with better tolerability. roxithromycin thus appears to be an effective and well-tolerated drug for the treatment of acute and recurrent sinusitis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of  activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the  bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella  catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

AB  == a retrospective study of 112 patients with septic arthritis (sa) caused by pyogenic organisms and fungi attended at the same medical service from 1975 to 1994. this sa was more common among male patients and the age at onset of disease was 42 +/- 23.2 years. predisposing factors were identified in 53 patients, the more common being connective tissue diseases and parenteral drug abuse (pda). the main portal of entry was bacteremia from a distant infective source. the most common causative agents were grampositive cocci (particularly s. aureus) and the  more uncommon organisms were recovered from patients with underlying diseases. the diagnostic delay was 14.1 +/- 28.1 days. single joint sa occurred in 88% of patients. large joints were mainly involved. on admission, 25% of patients had no fever and only 54% of them had leukocytosis; therefore, the lack of these findings in a given patient with acute arthritis should not rule out the possibility of sa. initial therapy consisted of daily arthrocentesis and i.v. antibiotics. the mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 47 +/- 23 days; the duration of the i.v. route was 23 +/- 14 days. an eighty percent of patients recovered without functional sequelae. the 31 patients who required surgical drainage had a longer diagnostic delay and a worse evolution, thus stressing the  necessity of an early diagnosis. in the last decade (1986-1994) an increase in some predisposing factors (iatrogenic sa and pda), a shorter diagnostic delay, a  more prolonged antibiotic therapy, a smaller proportion of surgical drainage and  an ultimate evolution identical to that in the previous decade were observed.

AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

AB  == in a prospective study bacteriological findings from frontal and maxillary sinus  secretes were analyzed. frontal sinus trephination was performed to 103 and maxillary irrigation to 192 patients. main pathogens in the frontal as well as in the maxillary sinus secretes were haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. beta-lactamase production of h. influenzae was found in 17% of frontal and in 16% of maxillary sinus samples. bacteriological findings were supported by the staining results. the portion of anaerobic pathogens in cultures were poor, though bacteroides fragilis antigen was detected in 8 frontal and 6 maxillary sinus samples. the acute frontal sinusitis should be treated with respective antibiotics. complications seem not to develop in the acute phase and  the disease can primarily be treated conservatively. it should however be controlled properly to avoid prolonged disease and late complications.

TI  == ciliary ultrastructure in experimental sinusitis.
AB  == ultrastructure of respiratory cilia was observed in experimental sinusitis of rabbit maxillary sinuses. sinus mucosa of 15 rabbits was inoculated with streptococcus pneumonia bacteria and of 16 rabbits with bacteroides fragilis bacteria. specimens were taken during 12 weeks' observation time and they were studied by transmission electron microscopy from the cross-sections. a special emphasis was paid to the number of cilia, the ciliary orientation, the tubular anomalies, the presence of dynein arms and the compound cilia. it seems likely that pneumococcal sinusitis is a more toxic infection to the epithelium causing loss of ciliated cells and cilia than b. fragilis infection. in anaerobic infection ciliary ultrastructure remains normal and dynein arms as well as normal tubular ultrastructure were seen even after 12 weeks' infection.

TI  == bacteriology of necrotizing infections of soft tissues.
AB  == background: necrotizing infections of soft tissues (nist) are being attributed to a large variety of organisms, besides the originally described beta-haemolytic streptococcus. a detailed bacteriological study of these infections was thought worthwhile. methods: a prospective study of 55 patients with nist was carried out. analysis of surface swabs and debrided tissue for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungal infection was performed. a detailed bacteriological profile was obtained in 50 patients. results: a total of 257 isolates (167 aerobic, 90 anaerobic) was obtained. one to nine strains of bacteria were isolated from each  patient. aerobic bacteria alone were isolated in 26 patients while the remaining  patients grew both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. forty-two patients had at least one gram-positive bacterium while 40 had at least one gram-negative bacterium. staphylococcus aureus was the organism isolated most frequently (52%), followed by bacteroides fragilis (40%) and anaerobic cocci (38%). group a beta-haemolytic streptococci were isolated in 16%. blood cultures were positive in only eight patients. fungal cultures were positive in six patients. aspergillus fumigatus was the commonest pathogen. conclusions: necrotizing infections of soft tissues are polymicrobial and no single bacterium is associated with a specific clinical entity. importance should be placed on early  recognition and treatment of the disease rather than on isolation of bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (ad). the objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected ad. methods: a retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained  from patients with secondarily infected ad lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three candida sp. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and escherichia coli in four. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in eight, and fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were s. aureus. twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella, and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. conclusions: the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected ad lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) the susceptibilities  of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. the mic  at which the growth of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (mic90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) seven puerperal women received 200 mg of cpdx-pr orally. the cpdx concentration in the  lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. the cpdx concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after cpdx-pr administration. the cpdx concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and  gradually declined thereafter. these results suggest that cpdx-pr, with its good  transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by  susceptible organisms.

AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == bactericidal activity, morphological alterations, and synergistic interactions of rufloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with its n-desmethylate d derivative (mf 922).
AB  == the in vitro activity of rufloxacin, alone and in combination with its metabolite (mf 922) against common respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and anaerobes was assessed. no synergistic interaction between rufloxacin and mf 922 was observed by the checkerboard technique against aerobic bacteria. when the time-kill system was employed, 24 synergistic interactions were noted out of 30 tests performed (80%), of which 14 (100%) were with enterobacteriaceae isolates, 2 with moraxella catarrhalis (50%), 4 with haemophilus influenzae (100%), 2 with staphylococcus aureus (50%) and 2 with streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (50%). synergism was found with all bacteroides fragilis irrespectively of the method used. rufloxacin alone or in combination with mf 922, at concentrations achieved in vivo, induced morphological alterations in all the pathogens analyzed with the exception of m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. towards s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae, the same levels of rufloxacin and mf 922 were capable of inducing  only bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect, followed by reversible morphological modifications. the presence of 50% human serum in the test media did not affect the results.

TI  == comparative evaluation of blood culture using the vital automated system and the  becton-dickinson septi-chek bhi-s biphasic and sch bottles.
AB  == a comparative study was performed using 1,168 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture pairs from 395 patients, during which 5-10 ml of blood were collected in both septi-chek bhi-s biphasic and septi-chek sch bottles (becton-dickinson, meylan, france) and vital aer and vital ana bottles (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france). the bottles were analyzed by using a 7-day protocol for vital and a 12-day protocol for septi-chek. the vital bottles revealed negative were all subcultured at the end of the protocol. of the 374 positive septi-chek bottles, only 202 bottles gave a positive subculture. of the 245 positive vital bottles, 223 bottles led to the isolation of a microorganism. thirty-five septic episodes were detected by septi-chek compared to 38 by the vital system (only clinically significant isolates were taken into consideration). four septic episodes were detected by vital only (one episode implicating coagulase-negative staphylococcus, one streptococcus pneumoniae, one pseudomonas aeruginosa and one  candida albicans, involving a total of 15 bottles). one septic episode implicating bacteroides fragilis was detected by septi-chek only (five bottles).  among the negative vital bottles, only six bottles gave a positive terminal subculture. this study validates the reliability of the vital system to detect positive blood cultures.

TI  == susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 s. uberis isolates, 3 s. acidominimus isolates, 2 streptococcus spp., 15 peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. all isolates except one bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin g, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the b. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (mic90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (mic90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). similar trends were noted for  susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (mic90s, 2.0 and  8 micrograms/ml, respectively). occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. tinidazole was  active against all anaerobes (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-lactamase was produced only by the b. fragilis isolate.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from taiwan.
AB  == to determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical  isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the national taiwan university hospital. the results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) against most of the tested bacteria. the mic90s for staphylococcus aureus  (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), streptococcus  pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. the mic50s for methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci,  and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. for s. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and b. fragilis, the mic50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. the resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. around 55% of s. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of s. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219), a new quinolone with extended activities against gram-positive pathogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the interesting in vitro antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of the new quinolone trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) warranted further studies to determine its in vivo efficacy in models of infectious disease. the significance of the pharmacokinetic and in vitro antimicrobial profiles of trovafloxacin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models by employing primarily oral therapy. against acute infections, trovafloxacin was consistently more effective than temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens while maintaining activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. in a model of murine pneumonia, trovafloxacin was more efficacious than temafloxacin, while  ciprofloxacin failed against s. pneumoniae (50% protective doses, 2.1, 29.5, and  >100 mg/kg, respectively). in addition to its inherent in vitro potency advantage against s. pneumoniae, these data were supported by a pharmacokinetic study that  showed levels of trovafloxacin in pulmonary tissue of s. pneumoniae-infected cf1  mice to be considerably greater than those of temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin (twice the maximum drug concentration in serum; two to three times the half-life, and three to six times the area under the concentration-time curve). against localized mixed anaerobic infections, trovafloxacin was the only agent to effectively reduce the numbers of recoverable cfu of bacteroides fragilis ( >1,000-fold), staphylococcus aureus (1,000-fold), and escherichia coli ( >100-fold) compared with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of  trovafloxacin and its pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals provide support for  the ongoing and planned human phase ii and iii clinical trials.

TI  == operative site bacteriology as an indicator of postoperative infectious complications in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  == toward the completion of elective colorectal operations, 75 patients had qualitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures of specimens obtained from peritoneal  irrigation fluid, anastomoses sites, and abdominal wound irrigation fluid to determine if a correlation exists between intraoperative flora and postoperative  infectious complications. patients enrolled in this prospective study received a  mechanical bowel prep and a 12-18 hour course of perioperative intravenous antibiotics. comparisons were made between the 60 (80%) patients who had no postoperative infections and the 15 (20%) who developed postoperative infectious  complications (9 wound infections, 6 intraabdominal infections). there were significantly more low anterior resections in patients who developed postoperative infection compared to those who had no postoperative infection (26% vs 2%), while there were more colocolostomies in the group with no infections (38% vs 7%). streptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis group, and escherichia coli were the most commonly isolated organisms from each of the three sites sampled. isolation of > or = 3 organisms from incisional wound cultures (p = 0.017) and <  or = 4 organisms from peritoneal irrigation (p = 0.009) or anastomotic culture (p = 0.004) correlated with development of postoperative infectious complications. thus, patients with infectious complications had significantly more isolates than those without infectious complications, and were more likely to have had a low anterior resection. these data suggest that future clinical studies should reexamine the duration of perioperative antimicrobials based on early laboratory  reports of qualitative and quantitative operative site bacteriology.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

AB  == in the 25-year period 1968-92, 3,317 out of 477,420 patients admitted to frederiksberg hospital experienced 3,491 episodes of bacteremia. enterobacteriaceae dominated as causative agents (57%), following by gram-positive cocci (31%) and anaerobes (7%). polymicrobial bacteremia was found  in 8% of the episodes. the incidence of enterobacteriaceae bacteremia culminated  in the middle (1978-82) of the period (4.7/1,000 admissions) and decreased during the last decade. gram-positive bacteremia increased throughout the period (from 1.8 to 2.9; p < 0.001), due mainly to increasing incidences of bacteremia caused  by non-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and coagulase-negative staphylococci. bacteroides fragilis accounted for a rising incidence of anaerobic bacteremia (from 0.3 to 0.7; p < 0.05). clinical data were available for the 2,599 bacteremic episodes in the 20-year period 1968-87. 59% of these were hospital acquired. of those, 38% were associated with indwelling catheters, mainly bladder catheters (28%) and i.v. lines (7%). the urinary tract dominated as source of bacteremia (46%), followed by the respiratory (11%) and the gastrointestinal tract (9%). half of the patients had predisposing underlying diseases, most frequently malignancies (20%) and diabetes mellitus (7%). the mortality rate related to bacteremia decreased from 25% to 11% (p < 0.001). more  than half (55%) of the fatal cases related to bacteremia occurred within the first 2 days after the first positive blood culture was obtained. logistic regression analysis defined 7 variables that independently influenced the outcome related to bacteremia: age, source, culture verification of source, shock, body temperature, leukocyte count and empiric antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == structural characteristics of polysaccharides that induce protection against intra-abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis is the anaerobe most commonly isolated from clinical cases of intra-abdominal sepsis. in a rodent model of this disease process, intraperitoneal injection of the capsular polysaccharide complex (cpc) from b. fragilis provokes abscess formation, while subcutaneous administration of this complex confers protection against b. fragilis-induced intra-abdominal abscesses. the cpc consists of two discrete polysaccharides, polysaccharides a and b (ps a and ps b), each possessing oppositely charged structural groups critical to the ability of these carbohydrates to induce the formation of abscesses. other bacterial polysaccharides that possess oppositely charged groups (such as the group antigen or capsular polysaccharide from streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 strains) also exhibited potent abscess-inducing capabilities. we report here that positively and negatively charged groups on polysaccharides are also essential for inducing protection against abscess formation. vaccination of rats with b. fragilis ps a, ps b, or the s. pneumoniae type 1 capsule protected against intra-abdominal abscesses subsequent to intraperitoneal challenge with each of these polysaccharides. chemical conversion of the free amino or carboxyl groups on ps a to uncharged n-acetyl or hydroxymethyl groups, respectively, abrogated the ability of this polymer to confer protection against polysaccharide-mediated  abscess formation. adoptive transfer of splenic t cells from polysaccharide-vaccinated rats to naive animals demonstrated that t cells mediated this protective activity. t cells transferred from animals vaccinated with a polysaccharide repeating unit (salmonella typhi vi antigen) that normally  contains one carboxyl group but was chemically converted to a polymer that possesses both free amino and carboxyl groups (accomplished by de-n-acetylating the vi antigen) protected naive t-cell recipients against polysaccharide-induced  abscesses. these results demonstrate that a distinct structural motif associated  with the b. fragilis polysaccharides is necessary for induction of protective immunity against abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis. however, protection is not antigen specific in a traditional sense. rather, the protective ability of these structurally dissimilar polysaccharides is conferred  by, and perhaps specific for, a motif of oppositely charged groups.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

TI  == is1139 from streptococcus salivarius: identification and characterization of an insertion sequence-like element related to mobile dna elements from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == an insertion sequence-like element, is1139, was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 chromosome. this insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. this is possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of is1161 from s. salivarius atcc 25975, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is30 from escherichia coli, and is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus. sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpa), revealed that is1139 is found in two strains of s. salivarius, atcc 25975 and atcc 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluations of a-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == a-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. a-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. a-80556 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against  ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, with an mic90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. however, the significance of this activity is not known. a-80556 was slightly less active against escherichia coli (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (mic90 for e. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). a-80556 was slightly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 2.0  micrograms/ml) and more active against acinetobacter spp. (respective mic90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. against bacteroides fragilis, the mic90 of a-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. the in vivo efficacy of a-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.

TI  == microorganisms and leukocytes in purulent sinusitis: a symbiotic relationship in  metabolism.
AB  == since the exchange of gases, as well as metabolites, is greatly impeded in a paranasal sinus empyema, it is not unlikely that certain organic substances be retained and accumulated in purulent secretion. in this study, secretions aspirated from experimentally infected maxillary sinuses of 26 rabbits were analysed biochemically. quantitatively, by far the most important acid accumulated in secretions was lactic acid. lactate induces metabolic acidosis and exerts an inhibitory effect on mammalian defense mechanisms. lactate may also be  used as an energy source by certain microorganisms. in spite of its leukocytic origin lactic acid thus promotes the continuation of a bacterial infection. in addition, certain other organic acids of bacterial origin were found, which, in different ways, contribute to the impediment of antimicrobial defense functions.

AB  == the presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of bacteroides (b.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. the importance, however, of these microorganisms in  the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. therefore,  the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of b. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. prostaglandin e2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. furthermore, the camp-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. of the bacterial species tested, b. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin e2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.

AB  == unilateral maxillary sinusitis was experimentally induced in new zealand white rabbits with streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343, and staphylococcus aureus v8. in another group of rabbits, sinusitis was induced  by blocking of the sinus ostium only. bacteriologic and light microscopic analysis was performed after 5 days to 1 month. granulation-like polyps developed after deep mucosal inflammatory trauma initiating fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelial migration to cover the polyp. in regions of a more superficial trauma-characterized by epithelial desquamation and fibroblast growth-proliferation and differentiation of basal cells resulted in the formation of microcavities dissecting off edematous polyps. polyps could be found in all sinusitis groups, irrespective of inducing agent. the cellular events of polyp formation appear to be the result of a continuous inflammatory reaction and are not directly related to the presence of a certain microorganism. instead, the potential of any microorganism to induce a deep mucosal trauma or epithelial desquamation seems essential for its ability to initiate polyp formation.

TI  == mucosal fine structure in experimental sinusitis.
AB  == rabbit maxillary sinuses were inoculated with streptococcus pneumoniae and bacteroides fragilis, and the histologic response in the sinus mucosa was observed over a 12-week period. an increased height of the cylindric cells and hyperplasia of the basal cells were frequent findings irrespective of the pathogen inoculated. the disease was found to influence the character of the secretory product from epithelial secretory cells and to degranulate the subepithelial glands. ciliary loss was a transitional finding. a reduction in the number of mitochondria, the occurrence of deformed short microvilli, and cytoplasmic blebbing were seen in the cells devoid of normal cilia. it is inferred from this study that pneumococcal sinusitis in rabbits is a self-limiting process, and the mucosal sequelae of the acute infection are persisting goblet cells, slight focal fibrosis, and edema. inoculation with b fragilis produces a chronic inflammatory process, with infiltration of mononuclear cells, luminal dilatation of the glands exhibiting zymogen granule depletion, and an increased thickness of the whole mucosal layer.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of skin and soft tissue infection in children.
AB  == skin and soft tissue infection and cutaneous abscesses are common in children. they may be polymicrobial in nature, especially when located proximal to mucous membranes. a general knowledge of the common causative bacterial organisms in these infections enables the physician to empirically institute antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available. this review assesses the number and types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that occur in skin and soft tissue infections in children. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were recovered from infections occurring at all body sites, but predominated in infections of the leg, neck, and hand. group d streptococci, enterobacteriaceae,  neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, and prevotella species were isolated mostly from infections of the external genitalia and perirectal areas; pigmented  prevotella and porphyromonas and haemophilus influenzae can be isolated from infections of the head and neck. management of skin and soft tissue infections in children should include surgical and medical therapy.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. a retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  == the microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic  or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. aerobic bacteria were  isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). the predominant aerobic  or facultative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (58), escherichia coli (17), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and haemophilus influenzae (12). the predominant anaerobes were pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species (24), bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and fusobacterium species (20). beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. these included all 42 tested s aureus and 15 b fragilis group, 4 of 9 k pneumoniae, 3 of 9 h influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 e coli. most patients from whom s pneumoniae and h influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with s aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. these data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (aspc) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (mics) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (pcs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. the mic80's of aspc against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis  group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. a  trend for increasing susceptibility to pcs including aspc was observed in the isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus influenzae. this trend in s. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant  s. aureus (mrsa) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of mrsa. the trend for the increased susceptibility in h. influenzae was related to  the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. the frequency of the strains highly resistant to pcs including aspc increased. 4. no pcs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while  among alpha-streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to pcs or those with resistant to pcs. these strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). meanwhile, a high frequency of highly pcs-resistant strains were noted among enterococcus faecium. in view of the fact that the pcs-resistance of e. faecium is known to be related to pbps, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.

TI  == hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of gas gangrene and perineal necrotizing fasciitis. a clinical and experimental study.
AB  == between 1971 and 1987, 32 patients with clostridial gas gangrene were treated in  the department of surgery, university of turku. a presumptive diagnosis of gas gangrene was made on the basis of the clinical appearance of the patient and a predominance of gram positive rods on stain. between 1973 and 1989, 11 patients with perineal necrotizing fasciitis (fournier's gangrene) were treated. the diagnosis was based on fulminating progression of perineal gangrene and on the presence of multiple pathogenic organisms in the primary gram stain or culture. all patients in both series underwent surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and intensive care. in addition, the patients were exposed to pure oxygen at 2.5  atmospheres absolute pressure (ata) for 120 minutes. three such treatments were given during the first 24 hours after admission after which the treatment was repeated twice daily. seventeen patients with clostridial gas gangrene had diffusely spreading myonecrosis; 6 died. fifteen patients developed clostridial cellulitis with toxicity; 3 died. thus, the overall mortality in gas gangrene was 28%. all the 9 patients who died had been transferred from other hospitals in finland and were moribund on arrival. the infection in 8 of these patients developed postoperatively. none of the patients with a posttraumatic infection died. each of the patients with fournier's gangrene had had nonspecific symptoms  before the gangrene became evident. the infection originated from the anorectal area in 5 patients, 1 patient had sustained a scrotal trauma and in 5 patients the underlying condition was unknown. one patient died 2 days after admission. six patients required a colostomy. to evaluate the therapeutic value of hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) treatment, two experimental models of clostridial gas gangrene, mono- and multimicrobial, were developed in rats. in the monomicrobial  infection model, 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) of clostridium perfringens were injected intramuscularly into the left hind limb of the rat. the mortality of untreated rats was 100%. the mortality of the rats treated with surgery alone was 38% compared to 13% when surgery was used in combination with hbo (p < 0.01; chi  2 test). in the group treated with hbo and surgery, 94% of the survivors healed completely and were able to walk normally, whereas the corresponding figure in the rats treated with surgery alone was 20% (p < 0.001; chi 2-test). in the multimicrobial gas gangrene model the infection was induced by an intramuscular injection of a mixture containing approximately 10(7) cfu of each of the following bacteria: clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == the mechanisms of preterm labor: common genital tract pathogens do not metabolize arachidonic acid to prostaglandins or to other eicosanoids.
AB  == objective: our aim was to determine the ability of pathogens commonly associated  with genital tract infection and preterm labor to incorporate arachidonic acid and to metabolize it to prostaglandins or to other eicosanoids. study design: four common genital tract pathogens, escherichia coli, streptococcus viridans, bacteroides fragilis, and a group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, were incubated  with tritium-labeled arachidonic acid for 2 to 48 hours. uptake of arachidonic acid was calculated from uptake of radioactivity into the organisms. tritium-labeled arachidonic acid within the medium was separated from any metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography to assess metabolism of arachidonic acid within the bacteria. results: although all organisms were able to take up arachidonic acid, analysis of its metabolism with high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that none of these organisms will synthesize cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or epoxygenase products. conclusion: bacterial infection cannot initiate preterm labor by intrinsic biosynthesis and release of  prostaglandins or other eicosanoids by the bacteria themselves.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. in general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against  staphylococcus aureus, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and yersinia spp.; and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both compounds were equally active against pseudomonas cepacia. the in vitro dna gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an e. coli enzyme. in vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin  in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. this study presents some potential advantages of the pure l isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.

TI  == heterologous gene expression in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and other gastrointestinal tract bacteroides are unusual gram-negative eubacteria in that genes from other gram-negative eubacteria are not expressed when introduced into these organisms. to analyze gene expression in bacteroides, expression vector and promoter probe (detection) vector systems were developed. the essential feature of the expression vector was the incorporation of a bacteroides insertion sequence element, is4351, which possesses promoter activity directed outward from its ends. genes inserted into the multiple cloning site downstream from an is4351 dna fragment were readily expressed in b. fragilis. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) structural gene from tn9 was tested and conferred chloramphenicol resistance on b. fragilis. both chloramphenicol resistance and cat activity were shown to be dependent on the is4351 promoters. similar results were obtained with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene (uida) but activity was just 30% of the levels seen with  cat. two tetracycline resistance determinants, tetm from streptococcus agalactiae and tetc from e. coli, also were examined. tetc did not result in detectable tetracycline resistance but the gram-positive tetm gene conferred high-level resistance to tetracycline and minocycline in bacteroides hosts. based on the cat results, promoter probe vectors containing the promoterless cat gene were constructed. these vectors were used to clone random b. fragilis promoters from partial genomic libraries and the recombinants displayed a range of cat activities and chloramphenicol mics in b. fragilis hosts. in addition, known e. coli promoters (ptet, ptac, ptrc, psyn, and p1p2rrnb) were tested for activity in b. fragilis. no chloramphenicol resistance or cat activity was observed in b. fragilis with these promoters.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: a review of its microbiology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. these include penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas spp. or bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) bacteroides spp. animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. no significant drug interactions have been noted to date. the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been  evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. in comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as  effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on  standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. however, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the mic(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. this should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses  can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. standard doses in  children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.

AB  == unilateral maxillary sinusitis was induced in 30 new zealand white rabbits with streptococcus pneumoniae or bacteroides fragilis. in another group of 15 rabbits  without infection, the sinus mucosa was surgically removed in defined areas. in both series, the sinuses were serially sectioned for histological analysis of the cellular regenerative capacity. in maxillary sinusitis induced by bacteroides fragilis, an inflammatory and also reparative process involving all mucosal layers including the underlying periosteum was seen. the more superficial trauma  as found in pneumococcal sinusitis eventually led to restitution ad integrum. following surgical removal, the denuded sinus-lining was reepithelized by a flattened ciliated epithelium on a lamina propria displaying fibrosis and lacking serous glands. the restoration of the rabbit maxillary sinus mucosa after surgical trauma thus leads to structural abnormalities of the epithelium as well  as the lamina propria, and these changes are likely to interfere with the normal  function of the sinus mucosa.

AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

AB  == concentrations of the two optic isomers of lactate (d- and l-form) as well as glucose, succinate, acetate, butyrate, isovalerate and valerate were examined in  purulent sinus secretions. the samples were obtained from rabbit maxillary sinuses, experimentally infected with streptococcus pneumoniae or bacteroides fragilis. more soluble acids such as acetate displayed relatively low levels in the secretion, despite a high microbial production. a substantial increase in d-lactate concentration was found in secretions only the first day after induction of pneumococcal sinusitis, and not in bacteroides sinusitis. l-lactate  levels were particularly high in secretions of a marked purulent character, and this isomer can be considered as indicator of anaerobic glycolysis in the leukocytes. less diffusible fatty acids such as butyrate and isovalerate accumulated in the secretion, in spite of a relatively lower production rate, and are thus more reliable indicators of bacterial metabolism.

TI  == experimental sinusitis in rabbits induced by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria: models for research in sinusitis.
AB  == experimental acute sinusitis can be induced in new zealand white rabbits by streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, or the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis, after  blocking of the sinus ostium. histological examination of the sinus mucosa in both models reveals edema, dilated venules, leukocytic infiltration, goblet cell  formation, as well as localized epithelial lesions. in comparison the bacteroides sinusitis enhances a more pronounced and long-lasting tissue reaction, including  periosteal thickening and new bone formation. the sinus mucosal blood flow as measured with microspheres sn113 is increased as compared to control side in pneumococcal sinusitis. an increased lactate concentration of sinus secretions as well as in the pathological sinus mucosa indicates an anaerobic metabolism. furthermore, a decreased atp-content of the sinus mucosa suggests an energy depletion which could impair epithelial function. the anaerobic milieu of the sinus secretion is probably created by the leukocytes as analyzed by the separation of the d- and l-form of lactate.

AB  == the authors report three trials of b-lactams and carbapenems for soft tissue infections treated on a surgical service: 1) cefmetazole versus cefoperazone, n = 44; 2) cefotetan versus cefoxitin, n = 24; and 3) meropenem versus imipenem, n =  44. a total of 138 hospitalized patients were enrolled with 112 meeting evaluability criteria. four hundred twenty-three isolates were cultured (mean, three/patient) of which 67 per cent were aerobes and 33 per cent anaerobes. cure  rates for each trial were: 1) 93 per cent; 2) 92 per cent; 3) 100 per cent. failures were caused by resistant organisms (streptococcus group d, bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas) appearing in incompletely drained infection sites. three patients receiving meropenem had adverse effects (headache, nausea) and one receiving cefoxitin (truncal rash). operative drainage and debridement remain the critical elements in therapy. agents with longer half lives allowing twice daily  dosing (cefmetazole and cefotetan) were as effective and less expensive than multiple doses of short-acting agents. the extended spectrum carbapenems are most useful for severe infections or resistant organisms.

TI  == the comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == the antimicrobial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol in root canals of extracted human teeth was compared. canals in single-rooted teeth were enlarged and inoculated with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and bacteroides gingivalis or bacteroides fragilis. after treatment with a test agent and sealing and incubation for 1 hour, the canal contents were analyzed for the number of viable  test bacteria and compared with that of inoculated teeth not treated with test agents. all test agents exhibited antimicrobial activity against all bacteria, with percent reductions in viable bacteria ranging from 64.3% to 100%. the combined data for pulpdent paste and calcium hydroxide showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than the combined data for camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol for s. mutans and b. gingivalis or b. fragilis but showed no difference for a. viscosus.

TI  == bacterial contamination in irreversible hydrocolloid impression material and gingival retraction cord.
AB  == this study tested two dental materials in factory-sealed containers for the presence of bacteria that may be a source of infection. twenty samples of two dental materials found to have contamination in a pilot study were taken from unopened containers using a sterile technique. the samples were inoculated onto chocolate agar plates and into thioglycolate broths with appropriate controls. plates were examined, colonies were enumerated, gram stained, and identified. the resulting contamination frequencies were compared for statistical significance using fisher's exact test. organisms were isolated from 10% of the negative inoculation control agar plates, while none of the control broths showed contamination. the alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) showed contamination in 50% of the plates and in 65% of the broths (p less than 0.05). the retraction cord had a small sample size and yielded organisms on 5% of the sample plates and in 20% of the thioglycolate broths (p greater than 0.05).

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == phospholipase c activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == phospholipase c (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the  hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride. bacterial production of phospholipase c may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms. use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase c activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract. multiple aerobic  (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase  c activity. phospholipase c-producing isolates included strains of bacteroides fragilis, b. bivius, b. thetaiotaomicron, gardnerella vaginalis, and group b streptococcus. phospholipase c activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity. phospholipase c production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in  some instances of preterm birth.

TI  == antibiotics and expression of microbial virulence factors: implications for host  defense.
AB  == the discovery that antibiotics are capable of modifying both the structural appearance and physiology of pathogenic bacteria when they are incorporated in the culture medium at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations, has led to numerous examples in which the expression of one or more virulence factors (both structural and soluble) is inhibited or potentiated--some of these bacterial products are recognized in their own right as substances which can interfere with one or more stages of the normal process of phagocytosis viz, chemotaxis and staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin; opsonization and m protein of streptococcus pyogenes; phagocytic ingestion and capsule of bacteroides fragilis; phagocytic killing and streptolysin o of streptococcus pyogenes. exposure to these bacteria  to low concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs can alter the efficacy of the phagocytic process. however, many examples exist in which no specific biochemical lesion induced by exposure to the antibiotic has been recognized. by  way of contrast some recent experimental studies using genetically defined variants of s. aureus expressing protein a, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin or coagulase  have allowed some discrimination as to the specifity of the drug action and the relative role of each virulence factor in bacterial pathogenicity. in particular  it can be recognized that the presence or absence of protein a either through drug treatment (clindamycin or fusidic acid) or through gene delation is critical in determining bacterial susceptibility to opson-ophagocytosis. extension of these studies to in vivo models will shed light on possible antibiotic-host defence interaction during chemotherapy.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == suppression of blastogenic transformation of lymphocytes by bacteroides fragilis  in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == bacteroides species and enterobacteriaceae are known to cause synergistic infections. however, the mechanisms behind this synergy are not completely understood. several authors have shown that bacteroides species may inhibit the phagocytosis of enterobacteriaceae by polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as by  macrophages. with the present study we have addressed the question of whether bacteroides fragilis (bf) is also capable of suppressing specific immune functions. when incubated together with murine lymphocytes, bf significantly inhibited the blastogenic transformation of these cells stimulated by escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (lps) or concanavalin a. this effect was dose dependent and was not mediated by prostaglandins. other bacteria such as e. coli or listeria monocytogenes did not show such an extensive suppression, while streptococcus pneumoniae was equally active. bf also inhibited the pokeweed mitogen induced blastogenic transformation of human lymphocytes. moreover, lymphocytes from bf-injected animals obtained 3 to 12 hours after infection proved to be partly refractory for lps-stimulation. finally, bf injections also affected t-cell dependent immunity as judged from the aggravation of an experimental listeriosis in mice.

TI  == [studies on suppurative lesion and bone distribution of peroral antimicrobial agents (lapc and tflx) to experimental infected rabbits].
AB  == the models of infection in the rabbits mandible using streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis by the method of satoh-heimdahl were prepared. a penicillic  peroral antimicrobial agent, lenamipicillin (lapc), and pyridone carboxylic acid  peroral antimicrobial agent, tosufloxacin tosilate (tflx), were administered to infected and healthy groups. drug concentrations in the serum, pus, mandible, maxilla, humerus, sternum, costa, ilium, femur, tibia, liver, and kidney were determined by a biological method. the data were submitted to pharmacodynamic analysis and compared. the following results were obtained. the concentration of  lapc in the serum and various bone tissues was 1.2-6.4 times higher in the infected group than in the healthy group. the concentration of tflx in the serum  and bone tissues was 1.1-3.7 times higher in the infected group than in the healthy group. moreover, concentrations in the liver 1.1-fold and 2.1-fold higher in the infectious group than in the healthy group in the lapc and tflx administration groups, respectively, and 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold higher in the kidney in the lapc and tflx groups, respectively. both lapc and tflx diffused to  the pus more satisfactorily than to the serum. the cmax ratios of pus to infected serum were 1.48 and 1.81 for lapc and tflx, respectively, and the auc ratios of pus to infected serum were 1.31 and 1.62 in lapc and tflx, respectively. these results indicated that both lapc and tflx are distributed satisfactorily to the local foci in the mandible, and that their systemic diffusion exerted immediate clinical effects.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of win 57273, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == win 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone that has an expanded spectrum of activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.008 microgram/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), bacillus spp. (mic90, 0.03 micrograms/ml), listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and bacteroides fragilis group strains (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). like other fluoroquinolone compounds, win 57273 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (97% of strains inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria strains (100% susceptible), acinetobacter spp. (100% susceptible),  and pseudomonas aeruginosa (68% susceptible). we observed that win 57273 was very active against cephalosporin- or aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative strains but shared cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones. increasing inoculum concentrations had minimal effects on win 57273 mics, and the drug was considered to be bactericidal based on reference mbc and kill curve analyses. unlike most previously studied drugs in this class, win 57273 had increased activity (three-  to fourfold) at low ph. rates of mutation to win 57273 resistance at eight times  its mic were in the range of 5.6 x 10(-8) to greater than 1.4 x 10(-9). this new  compound possesses a wide potential spectrum of use, and it should be evaluated further by in vitro and in vivo studies.

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

TI  == the in-vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of temafloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of temafloxacin compared with other quinolone antibiotics was evaluated using 579 bacterial strains and three isolates of chlamydia trachomatis. the mics of temafloxacin for 90% of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis and ch. trachomatis were all less than or equal to 1 mg/l, an activity comparable with or superior to that of ofloxacin and superior to those of fleroxacin and norfloxacin. temafloxacin, although more active against anaerobes, was in general slightly less active than  ciprofloxacin. against streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa) temafloxacin was twice as active as ciprofloxacin. the pharmacokinetics of temafloxacin were studied in six volunteers, following a single 400 mg oral dose, measuring concentrations in plasma, inflammatory fluid and urine. mean peak plasma levels of 3.3 mg/l were achieved. the mean plasma elimination half life was 6.8 h and the percentage penetration into blister fluid was 104.5%. of the administered dose 51.8% was excreted in urine by 26 h. serum and blister fluid levels in excess of 1 mg/l were present for at least 8 h post dose, suggesting that a once or twice daily dosing regimen would be suitable for  the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of bo-1341, a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin.
AB  == bo-1341, a new antipseudomonal semisynthetic cephalosporin, was evaluated for in  vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the in vitro activity of bo-1341 was generally superior or comparable to the activities of the reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae. bo-1341 was highly active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic for 90% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), pseudomonas maltophilia (mic for 50% of the strains tested, 1.56  micrograms/ml), and acinetobacter calcoaceticus (mic for 90% of the strains tested, 3.13 micrograms/ml). furthermore, bo-1341 was highly active against p. aeruginosa isolates resistant to the other antibiotics. of 199 p. aeruginosa isolates tested, only 2 were resistant to bo-1341. these two strains were also resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and nonenteric streptococci were also susceptible to bo-1341, but staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis were not susceptible to the compound. the protective efficacy against experimental infections in mice caused by nine strains of gram-negative bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, reflected the potent in vitro activity.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of at-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  == at-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. its mics for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the genera pseudomonas, branhamella, campylobacter, haemophilus, and neisseria. its mics were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera xanthomonas, acinetobacter, alcaligenes, moraxella, flavobacterium, and brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against mycobacterium spp. the potencies of at-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. the potencies of at-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, mycoplasma spp., chlamydia spp., and mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which at-4140 was compared. at-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. the in vivo efficacies of at-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase in mixed infections in mice in relation to treatment with ampicillin.
AB  == beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis in a localized mixed infection has been found to degrade the beta-lactam antibiotic at the focus of infection, thus protecting both the bacteria and pathogens susceptible to the antibiotic. to determine if beta-lactamase produced by hemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis have similar importance in mixed infections, a thread infection model in mice was used to evaluate the capacity of beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, or h. influenzae to hydrolyze ampicillin in a mixed infection with streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. for both s. aureus and b. catarrhalis, the ampicillin concentrations at infection sites where beta-lactamase was produced were lower than at sites where beta-lactamase was not produced; however, this difference was not found when clavulanic acid was added to the ampicillin. in mixed infections with strains that did not produce beta-lactamase, ampicillin concentrations were  similar with or without clavulanic acid. s. aureus was the best "protector" followed by b. catarrhalis. the beta-lactamase produced by h. influenzae failed to protect the s. pneumoniae. no bactericidal effect of clavulanic acid was found.

TI  == enhancement of survival from murine polymicrobial peritonitis with increased abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == muramyl dipeptide (mdp), a purified synthetic immune adjuvant, has been shown to  increase murine intraabdominal abscess formation in a monomicrobial model using bacteroides fragilis. this effect required live bacteria and was abolished by appropriate antibiotics. a polymicrobial model of peritonitis and abdominal abscess formation using streptococcus fecalis, escherichia coli, and b. fragilis  was initially used to determine mortality rates at various concentrations and obtain an appropriate ld50. animals were then pretreated with mdp or its inert buffer and underwent intraperitoneal injection of the appropriate bacterial suspension. mortality and abdominal abscess formation were then assessed at 2 weeks after injection. there was a significant reduction in mortality (p less than 0.03) in mice treated with mdp compared to the controls. in surviving animals, there was also a significant increase in the number of animals forming abscesses (p less than 0.05) following treatment with mdp. this study has shown that nonspecific immune stimulation by mdp provided enhanced protection against a polymicrobial intraperitoneal challenge and paradoxically increased the formation of abdominal abscesses at the same time. this may be regarded as enhancement of the natural history of survival from peritonitis via bacterial containment through intraabdominal abscess formation, a manifestation of beneficial outcome in experimental peritonitis.

TI  == plasma tumor necrosis factor levels in patients with presumed sepsis. results in  those treated with antilipid a antibody vs placebo.
AB  == using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) in 38 patients who were treated with either antilipid a antibody or a placebo for presumed gram-negative bacteremia. sixteen of the 38 patients had positive blood cultures: 14 with gram-negative rods and 2 with streptococcus pneumoniae. initial serum samples for tnf determinations were obtained within 2 to 72 hours (mean, 18.8 hours) after the onset of clinical signs of sepsis. six (16%) of 38 patients had detectable tnf levels: 4 of 14 with positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods but only 2 of 22 with negative blood cultures (odds ratio, 4; 95% confidence limits, 0.5 and 24.3). of the 6 patients, 4 had received the placebo and 2 had received the antibody. tumor necrosis factor levels did not predict adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, or mortality. the highest tnf levels (500 and 250 pg/ml) were observed in 2 patients with enterobacter cloacae bacteremia who had received the placebo and antilipid a antibody, respectively. the other 2 patients with bacteremia and detectable tnf levels had positive blood cultures for haemophilus influenzae (50 pg/ml) and bacteroides fragilis (120 pg/ml), respectively. despite negative blood cultures,  the remaining 2 patients repeatedly had detectable tnf levels and a clinical picture consistent with gram-negative sepsis.

TI  == intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  == a total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. these included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one  of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis.  the causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). these pathogens  included staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis one, streptococcus pyogenes two, streptococcus pneumoniae two, viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, haemophilus influenzae one, escherichia coli 12, enterobacter cloacae three, proteus mirabilis one, acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, salmonella spp. two, shigella sonnei one, bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. no bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. of  a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in sgot and leukopenia in one patient. side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe  and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.

TI  == [the influence of cefpodoxime proxetil on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cpdx-pr dry syrup was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of bacteria: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no notable changes were observed in fecal viable cell counts except that slight decreases of e. coli counts were observed on the days 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with infections, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 1 year 1 month to 6 years 10 months, with their body weights ranging from 9.3 to 23.8 kg. cpdx-pr dry syrup was administered at a dose between 3.0 to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although some variations of the  fecal bacterial flora were noticed between subjects during the administration of  cpdx-pr, no notable changes were observed in major aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium in 4 of the 5 cases. large decreases in streptococcus, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and anaerobic cocci and an increase in enterococcus  were observed in the other case. there was no case in which glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. regarding enterobacteriaceae, transitory bacterial replacement was observed within the genus. fecal concentration of cpdx during the administration of cpdx-pr was extremely low or below the detectable limit except one specimen from a case in which intestinal bacterial flora showed remarkable changes. from the above, cpdx-pr appears to be a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal  bacterial flora.

TI  == pathogenicity of enterococci in a rat model of fecal peritonitis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens with or without streptococcus faecalis. mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. the presence of s. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. s. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

TI  == in vivo ph of induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice.
AB  == infections in the diabetic host have been shown to persist longer than those in the nondiabetic host. to investigate whether intra-abscess milieu might be a contributing factor to this persistence, the in vivo intra-abscess ph was measured in induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. two models (female genetically obese insulin-resistant and male streptozocin-induced  diabetic mice) were used with appropriate controls. the bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus (b + e), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus (s + e), and s. aureus (sa). intra-abscess ph measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. in the diabetic mice, the ph of an abscess induced with b + e, s + e, and sa was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the ph in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. the blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. no  animals were ketotic. there were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. in conclusion, there is a significantly lower ph in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

(1) by oral administration, the maximum abpc concentration in the pus and bone tissues was 5.9 to 34.3% of the serum, by intramuscular injection 10.4 to 27.5% and by i.v. infusion 12.1 to 42.4%. (2) the maximum concentration of orally administered oflx in the pus and bone tissues was 52.5 to 111.7% of the serum, by intramuscular injection 56.4 to 100.3% and by i.v. infusion 61.2 to 121.8%. (3) when administered orally, injected intramuscularly, or infused intravenously abpc showed good penetration into the pus, mandibula and ilium, and oflx into the pus, sternum and ilium. when infused intravenously, oflx in the pus and bone tissues was higher than the mic of both strains. (4) when abpc was administered as under  3 routes, t1/2 was longer in the pus and most bone tissues than in the serum. t1/2 of oflx was shorter in most bone tissues by all administration routes than in serum, t1/2 was longer for oflx than for abpc, except when orally administered. (5) auc of abpc was in the order of intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection and oral administration. about the same auc of oflx was shown after i.v. infusion and i.m. injection, both values being about double after oral administration. in all administration routes, auc of pus surpassed auc of serum and auc of oflx greatly surpassed that of abpc.

TI  == [study on the formation of experimental infected rabbit].
AB  == the purpose of the present study is to produce a model of infections of oral cavity by inducing abscess in the mandibla of new zealand white rabbits as close  to the oral cavity infection site as possible in order to determine whether the administered antimicrobial agents will transfer to the localized inflammatory foci. the pus to be collected should be 0.5 to 1.0g or more to permit bioassay and it should be collectable under nearly uniform conditions at all times. new zealand white rabbit was the experimental animal used, in which anesthesia was induced intraperitoneally to expose the mandibula. a hole was made in the mandibula, into which a small cotton pellet inoculated with streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis, whose cell concentrations had been adjusted to 10(8)cfu/ml, was implanted and the opening was carefully closed with sutures tightly. these two species of bacteria had been selected because mixtures of gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated in most cases from  the occluded abscess of oral cavity infections. as a result of the above procedure, it was found that one week after production of the infected model animal, the abscess contained adequate volume of, pus for collection and demonstrated viability of the two transplanted species of bacteria. this animal model was considered an ideal model for use in the studies on treatment of infections in the oral cavity by administering antimicrobial agents to determine  the extent of drug transfer into the pus and bones where purulent foci are present.

TI  == [antibiotherapy in biliary surgery. current status].
AB  == without antibiotherapy, biliary surgery is often followed by infectious complications, possibly serious, indeed life-threatening. biliary bacteria do are responsible of these complications; mainly e. coli, streptococcus faecalis (whose pathogenicity is disputed) and klebsiella. bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa are restricted to special circumstances. it is often difficult to presee whether bile is infected: some risk factors were emerged by keighley but their specificity is not excellent; peroperative gram staining got various results according to the studies. some prefer to give a systematic antibiotherapy. preoperative antibiotic treatment should be as short as possible  because it does not sterilize bile, but selects resistant bacteria, which induce  postoperative complications. it must mainly be aimed at preventing infectious scattering. surgery is the main part of the treatment. antibiotic choice has to take into account clinical picture, bacteria (those probably responsible for and  their sensibility) and goal of the treatment (prophylactic or curative). analysis of failures should allow to improve this choice. but only multicenter studies concerning full selected populations of patients are able to prove superiority of one antibiotic to another.

AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

TI  == a clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  == we have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. responsible pathogens were escherichia coli in 8, staphylococcus aureus in 6, hemophilus influenzae in 2, streptococcus pneumoniae  in 3, streptococcus viridans in 2, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, bacteroides fragilis in 1, salmonella d1 in 1, shigella sonnei in 1, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, enterobacter agglomerans in 1, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, enterobacter  cloacae in 1, group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. side reactions were seen in  five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. all these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. these results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide and group b streptococcus serotype ii glycocalyx have a common major antigenic determinant.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab) to the beta-1-6-linked digalactose structure in the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of bacteroides fragilis reacted with 47 of 416 group b streptococcus (gbs) strains tested by an immunofluorescence technique (if). the reactivity of mab was, with a few exceptions, limited to type ii gbs. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that an antigen purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using mab from type ii gbs contained galactose,  glucose and fatty acids. this confirmed that mab is directed to the digalactose (which in earlier studies was found to occur) in the capsular lipocarbohydrate specific to type ii gbs. the positive strains yielded a strong, apple-green surface stain by means of the if using mab. various immuno-electron microscopic (iem) methods showed that the determinant was located in the glycocalyx layer of  gbs at a distance of about 15 nm from the streptococcal cell wall. the structure  harbouring the determinant was found to be very loosely attached to the bacteria. however the cross-reactive determinant seemed to maintain its immunoreactivity whether it was extracted by gentle washing with saline or with harsher treatments usually reserved for preparing streptococcal polysaccharide antigens. in conclusion, the study shows that the determinant is an integral part of the type-specific antigen of type ii gbs and that mab has a potential use as a serotyping reagent.

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

TI  == synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  == the in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with neisseria gonorrhoea, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or str. faecalis. the in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the mics with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. the mics of metronidazole for b. melaninogenicus, b. fragilis and b. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. the in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. combined  therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. furthermore, a reduction in the  number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. the synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

AB  == the relationship between streptococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteria was studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. included in the study were one strain of s. faecalis, three strains each of the bacteroides fragilis group and b. melaninogenicus group, and five strains of anaerobic cocci. the relationship between the organisms was studied by determining the individual change in colony-forming units (cfus) of the two bacterial components that induces abscesses in mice, compared to the cfus of each of the isolated when inoculated alone. of the eleven combinations, the cfus of s. faecalis increased in seven and decreased in two. the cfus of anaerobic bacteria were never increased and were decreased in two. a mutual decrease in growth occurred only in the combinations of s. faecalis and b. melaninogenicus group. this study demonstrates the potential for pathogenicity of s. faecalis in mixed infections with the b. fragilis group and anaerobic cocci.

TI  == cefotaxime lavage in children undergoing appendicectomy.
AB  == in an attempt to reduce postoperative sepsis, a series of randomised, double-blind studies was begun in 1982, using cefotaxime as backbone therapy. up  to 1985 (stages i and ii), the best results were obtained using a combination of  cefotaxime (75 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses at 12-hourly intervals) plus metronidazole (10 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses), both drugs administered 1 hour before surgery (preoperatively) or at anaesthetic induction (peroperatively). in  300 consecutive cases, the wound infection rates were 1% in uncomplicated acute appendicitis and 5% in perforated/gangrenous appendices. the present study (stage iii) reports the findings in 401 consecutive patients: 215 treated with the above regimen, either pre- or perioperatively (group 1) and 186 who additionally had peritoneal lavage with cefotaxime 2 g/l during surgery (group 2). there were 16 wound infections overall, 2 among patients administered prophylaxis preoperatively and 14 in those administered prophylaxis perioperatively. all produced mixed cultures, with escherichia coli, streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis predominating. the overall figures for postoperative sepsis  are 12/215 (5.6%) in the non-lavage group and 8/186 (4.3%) in the lavage group. among patients with a perforated and/or gangrenous appendix, the wound infection  rate was 8/72 (11.1%) in the non-lavage group (group 1) and 4/66 (6.1%) in the lavage group (group 2). each group had 2 cases of pelvic abscess.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == effect of prophylactic antibiotics upon mixed infections with bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations to explore the effect of  prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. subcutaneous abscesses in mice were induced by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci and escherichia coli. the infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else  metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. however, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (cfu) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the cfu of both components of mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis with either staphylococcus aureus or group a streptococci. cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. these data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.

TI  == spectrum and mode of action of azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new 15-membered-ring macrolide with improved potency against gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (cp-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin a; also designated xz-450 [pliva pharmaceuticals, zagreb, yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. it was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against branhamella catarrhalis, campylobacter species, and legionella species. it had activity similar to that of erythromycin against chlamydia spp. azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family enterobacteriaceae; its mic for 90% of strains of escherichia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. it displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates. it had moderate activity against bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. the  mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14c]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.

AB  == the comparative in-vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates.  the new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l). among other gram-positive organisms tested, a  significant number were resistant to a-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. a-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against pasteurella multocida and campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against legionella spp. (mic90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l) and bact. melaninogenicus (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). activity of a-56268 was ph dependent (more active at ph 7 than at ph 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. the drug was bactericidal against two strains of streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against staphylococcus aureus and str. faecalis.

TI  == tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and clindamycin.
AB  == the tetracyclines are effective in the treatment of chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and rickettsial infections and may also be used for gonococcal infections in patients unable to tolerate penicillins. these drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation, photo-toxic dermatitis, diarrhea, vestibular damage, and hepatotoxicity in pregnant women. chloramphenicol is used primarily for anaerobic infections, haemophilus influenzae meningitis, and typhoid fever. the most important toxic effect of chloramphenicol is bone marrow suppression, which  can be dose related or idiosyncratic. erythromycin is the drug of choice for the  treatment of infections caused by m. pneumoniae, legionella species, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the frequency of serious untoward effects associated with the use of erythromycin is low; epigastric distress may occur. clindamycin is active against bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic microorganisms. pseudomembranous enterocolitis has developed  in as many as 10% of patients taking this drug. the use of clindamycin should be  discontinued promptly if diarrhea occurs.

TI  == study of appendicitis in children treated with four different antibiotic regimens.
AB  == this is a prospective and randomized study of 100 patients with acute appendicitis who were less than 10 years old, in which four different antibiotic  regimens commonly in use against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria were compared in terms of postoperative septic complications. the antibiotics were begun immediately preoperatively and continued for five days. ten percent of the  patients developed infection complications, with 4% requiring further surgery. the best results were obtained with cefoxitin (4% of infection), metronidazole plus amikacin and latamoxef (8%), while the regimen of clindamycin plus amikacin  was associated with the greatest number of complications (20%). on analyzing the  main microbiologic findings of the study, we conclude that some sort of antibiotic treatment is indicated in all types of appendicitis, due to the occult presence of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity, even without clinical evidence of  gangrene or perforation. further, we emphasize the significance of streptococcus  faecalis as being responsible, along with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, for serious postoperative complications.

TI  == the role of bacteroides encapsulation in the lethal synergy between escherichia coli and bacteroides species studied in a rat fibrin clot peritonitis model.
AB  == encapsulation in bacteroides species has been thoroughly studied in vivo as a virulence factor in abscess formation. its pathogenic role in lethal infections caused by a mixture of pathogens has been less well investigated. our previous studies using the rat fibrin clot peritonitis model have demonstrated lethal synergy between bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. in order to determine  the synergistic role of the encapsulation of the bacteroides component in this model, inoculations of e. coli plus one of seven bacteroides strains of differing degrees of encapsulation were assessed for their effect on mortality. both unencapsulated bacteroides strains tested (b. distasonis 1244, b. vulgatus 4300)  produced an early lethal synergistic effect with e. coli while the heavily encapsulated strain, b. thetaiotaomicron 1603 did not do so. the four other bacteroides strains tested were encapsulated and their synergy with e. coli was demonstrated. control gram-positive strains, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, did not alter mortality when mixed with e. coli in this model. these studies support the concept that virulence factors other than encapsulation are important in the outcome of polymicrobial infections in which bacteroides species play a part.

TI  == does an intracervical infection influence the fibrinolytic activity and the collagen content of the fetal membranes? a study of ascending infections in pregnant ewes.
AB  == apart from solely mechanical explanations, premature rupture of the membranes (prom) has been suggested to be caused by an ascending infection. in order to investigate the role of infection in the mechanism of prom, pregnant ewes were experimentally inoculated endocervically with either bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus intermedius or group b streptococci. these microorganisms were previously reported to be implicated in prom in humans. the present investigation concerns the possible effect of an experimentally induced ascending infection on  the collagen content and fibrinolytic activity (fa) of the fetal membranes. no relationship was observed between an ascending infection during pregnancy and the collagen content content of the fetal membrane specimens. it was concluded that changes in the collagen content bear no etiological significance in the mechanism of premature membrane rupture irrespective of an ascending infection's being present or not. concerning fa in only one case, experiencing a strept. intermedius amnionitis, was an elevated fa value observed. this finding indicates that the involvement of fa in the process of membrane rupture following ascending infection during pregnancy cannot be ruled out.

TI  == preterm labor: stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism in human amnion cells by bacterial products.
AB  == there is a strong association between preterm labor and infection. some potentially pathogenic bacteria have phospholipase activity, and it has been suggested that release of phospholipase from these organisms may increase prostaglandin e2 synthesis in amnion cells and hence initiate preterm labor. in this study we established monolayer amnion cell cultures from tissue collected at elective cesarean section at term before labor. cells were prelabeled with tritiated arachidonic acid and then further incubated after addition of 2%, 5%, or 10% (vol/vol) filtered medium in which either group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, or lactobacillus had been growing. tritiated arachidonic acid and its metabolites released by the amnion cells in these or control incubates were extracted from culture medium and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. addition  of conditioned medium from each of the organisms with the exception of lactobacillus caused an increase in overall arachidonic acid metabolism. there was an increase in the ratio of cyclooxygenase to lipoxgenase metabolism and in prostaglandin e2 production in particular when compared to controls. the profile  of arachidonic acid metabolism in amnion cells following addition of filtered bacterial medium resembled that obtained from amnion cells cultured following spontaneous labor. we suggest that abnormal bacterial colonization of the genital tract may lead to an increase in arachidonic acid metabolism in amnion cells with an increase in prostaglandin e2 production and the consequent initiation of preterm labor.

TI  == induction of an atypical interferon by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli  in experimental infections and in leukocyte cultures.
AB  == previous reports have shown that bacteroides fragilis may enhance the pathogenicity of coinfecting enterobacteriaceae by interfering with the host's immune response. with the present study, we have investigated the possible role of interferons (ifn) in mediating these effects. mice injected with b. fragilis developed moderate serum levels of ifn that appeared just prior to alterations of the animals' immunity described earlier. the ifn was neutralized by treatment with anti-ifn-alpha/beta-antibodies or hydrochloric acid; hence it displayed the  same "atypical" characteristics as ifn found in patients with immuno-compromising diseases such as aids, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. escherichia coli displayed the same induction patterns as b. fragilis, while gram-positive bacteria induced "regular" ifn alpha/beta and gamma. spleen cells,  peritoneal macrophages, or liver leukocytes taken from b. fragilis or e. coli-injected animals 6 h post infection were refractory to ifn induction by e. coli lipopolysaccharide in vitro; cells from mice infected with gram-positive organisms showed normal or enhanced responsiveness.

AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). pefloxacin (mics mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against enterobacteriaceae. gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. pefloxacin (mics 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (mics 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.001-0.008 mg/l). pefloxacin (mics 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (mics 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and  norfloxacin (mics 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-0.008 mg/l). the activity of pefloxacin (mics 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (mics 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin (mics 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. pefloxacin (mics mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic  strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (mics 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == anaerobes and septic abortion.
AB  == the bacterial flora of the genital tracts of twenty-two patients with septic abortion and twenty normal women (as controls) were studied to determine the significant aetiological agents. the predominant flora qualitatively and quantitatively in the twenty-two patients were anaerobes. bacteroides bivius was  isolated from all the twenty-two patients and from twelve out of twenty normal controls. the next commonest anaerobes were b. asaccharolyticus (fourteen out of  twenty-two patients), b. melaninogenicus (ten out of twenty-two), b. fragilis (eleven out of twenty-two), b. disiens (eight out of twenty-two) and anaerobic cocci (six out of twenty-two); they were also isolated from nine out of twenty, twelve, zero, eight and three control subjects respectively. the commonest facultative bacteria isolated from both the patients and afebrile controls were escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes and streptococcus faecalis. the comparative increase in number of patients colonized by the anaerobes and the increase in the bacteria, by quantitative assessment in the patient group, signify the importance of anaerobes in septic abortion.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == intestinal bacteria translocate into experimental intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == experimental intra-abdominal abscesses were initiated by surgical implantation of a fibrin clot contaminated with either bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, or b fragilis-escherichia coli. seven days after surgery the numbers of bacteroides (per gram) in b fragilis and b thetaiotaomicron abscesses  were typically log10 8.4 +/- 0.5 (n = 6) and log10 6.4 +/- 0.6 (n = 4), respectively; b fragilis-e coli abscesses typically contained log10 8.9 +/- 0.5 b fragilis and log10 7.6 +/- 0.6 e coli (n = 5). of 38 b fragilis abscesses, 14 b fragilis-e coli abscesses, and nine b thetaiotaomicron abscesses, additional intestinal bacteria were recovered from 21 (55%), 13 (93%), and seven (89%) abscesses, respectively. the additional organisms, in decreasing order of frequency, were enterococci, e coli, staphylococci, alpha-streptococci, lactobacilli, and proteus species in numbers ranging from 2.5 log10 to 7.9 log10  per gram of abscess. histologic sections of contaminated abscesses adherent to the intestine, liver, or spleen revealed normal tissue histology and no breakdown of the abscess wall. thus, intestinal bacteria translocated into intra-abdominal  abscesses by a mechanism that did not appear to be surgical soilage.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of a novel penem fce 22101 compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == fce 22101 is a penem antibiotic which inhibits the majority of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/l. it inhibits staphylococci, haemolytic streptococci  and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species are resistant. bacteroides fragilis and  clostridium species are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mg/l. fce 22101 is not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chrosmosomal beta-lactamases. it shows minimal discrepancy between mic and mbc values and there is minimal effect of inoculum size. although fce 22101 is generally less active against enterobacteriaceae than are cefotaxime and ceftazidime, it does inhibit some enterobacter spp. resistant to these agents. fce 22101 and imipenem are similar in activity against gram-positive and anaerobic species.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

TI  == evolution and epidemiology of mls resistance.
AB  == within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls). this paper is limited to a description of the evolution of  different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. three groups will therefore be studied in turn: staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and bacteroides fragilis. there is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of mlsb resistance observed  in clostridium perfringens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in escherichia coli.

AB  == using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas species. unlike many newer beta-lactams, sch 34343 was highly active  against gram-positive species. it was consistently active against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic50 and mic90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). this, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. sch 34343 was the most active compound tested  against bacteroides fragilis. in tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. it had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. it showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at ph values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees c. binding in human plasma was 72%. we concluded  that sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == [effect of flash chemoprophylaxis by cefotaxime on the appearance of postoperative bacterial superinfections in surgery of the prostate].
AB  == the effect on bacteriologically documented postoperative infection of flash prophylaxis using two intravenous injections of 20 mg/kg cefotaxime each was evaluated in a double blind, randomized trial against placebo. 181 participants free of urinary tract infection prior to surgery had either transurethral prostatic resection (tur) (n = 90) or open prostatectomy (op) (n = 91). urine samples, blood samples, prostate specimens and skin swabs were investigated for pathogens. rate of urinary tract infection was significantly reduced by cefotaxime (ctx) prophylaxis in both groups. ctx lowered the incidence of early postoperative urinary tract infection from 30% to 4% in turs and from 46% to 4.5% in ops. similarly, a significant difference was demonstrated for incidences of intra and postoperative bacteremia. in open prostatectomy patients, a reduced rate of wound infection and shorter hospital stay were noted in the treated group. pathogens recovered in this study were streptococcus (29%), staphylococcus (20.5%), enterobacteriaceae (45.75%), pseudomonas (1.25%), acinetobacter (3%), and bacteroides fragilis (0.5%). ctx prophylaxis apparently has no bearing on postoperative emergence of resistant pathogens. percentage of resistance to ctx in delayed postoperative infections was 33% in the control group and 35% in the treated group. we conclude that flash ctx prophylaxis in transurethral or open prostatectomy is of benefit in reducing morbidity and hospital costs.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. the pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against candida albicans. there was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity was dialyzable and ph dependent, but independent of heat,  the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. electron micrographs of escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. the antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. it is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of dn-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess: bacteriological evaluation.
AB  == the pus from a series of 41 peritonsillar abscesses was examined bacteriologically. in the majority of the abscesses a mixed bacterial flora was found. the specimens yielded 0-7 different bacterial species per abscess (mean 3.0). one species alone was isolated only in five cases (12.5%). both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were isolated from the specimens of 25 patients (61%), only  anaerobes from two specimens (4.9%), and only facultative bacteria from 12 specimens (29%). beta haemolytic streptococci were cultured in 43.9% of the cases, but streptococcus pyogenes group a in only 10 cases (24.4%). thus, the pus of the peritonsillar abscess seems to be caused by a mixed bacterial infection, where anaerobic bacteria play a significant role. indications of tonsillectomy in cases with peritonsillar abscess are discussed.

AB  == preliminary experiments were performed to assess the use of intestinal bacteroides spp. as indicators of fecal contamination of water. viable counts of  bacteroides fragilis, an anaerobic bacterium, declined more rapidly than those of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. however, a fluorescent antiserum prepared against b. fragilis successfully detected high proportions (18 to greater than 50%) of b. fragilis cells suspended for 8 days in aerobic water in dialysis bags at the ambient temperature. these percentages were higher than the  percent viable recoveries of the two indicator bacteria used for comparison. thus, the fluorescent antiserum test for b. fragilis might serve as a useful indicator of fecal contamination of water. an advantage of this approach over coliform analysis is the rapidity at which the test can be performed.

TI  == does cytomegalovirus play a role in community-acquired pneumonia?
AB  == cytomegalovirus (cmv) is recognized as an important pathogen in the immuno-suppressed patient. sporadic case reports of cytomegalovirus community-acquired pneumonia have appeared. we studied 443 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization to define the role of cytomegalovirus in this illness. four patients (0.9%) had good evidence that cytomegalovirus caused their pneumonia: 2 had the virus isolated from pulmonary tissue and 2 had cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies visualized in this tissue. an additional 14 patients had serologic evidence (a fourfold rise in the complement  fixation tests) of cytomegalovirus infection. analysis of these 18 patients suggest, that cytomegalovirus plays a role in community-acquired pneumonia. six (33%) of the patients were immunosuppressed. six others had concomitant infections: chlamydia trachomatis (3); epstein-barr virus and m. pneumoniae (1);  and bacteremia with group b streptococcus and bacteroides fragilis plus eubacterium lentum (1 each). seven patients (39%) required assisted ventilation,  four of whom developed secondary bacterial pneumonia. five (28%) died. only two patients had a clinical and radiographic picture suggestive of a viral illness as a cause of the pneumonia. three patients had atypical lymphocytes in their peripheral blood film. we found that the prevalence of complement fixing antibody to cytomegalovirus increased with age. such antibody was lacking among those in the 16-20 year group while it peaked at 65% for males and at 78% for females ages 91-100 years. despite the fact that 42.2% of the adults lacked antibody to cytomegalovirus, community-acquired pneumonia due to this virus is uncommon and does not justify routine serological testing for such infection among patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == genetics of clindamycin resistance in bacteroides.
AB  == results presented in this paper have shown that a widely distributed lm-resistance determinant is present on at least 3 distinct bacteroides r-plasmids. in fact these plasmids bear no homology outside of the defined regions implicated in the lm resistance. this resistance determinant on pbf4, pbftm10, and pbi136 is located within dna segments bounded on each side by a directly repeated sequence of more than 500 bp. the intervening sequences of these 3 elements are variable, and range in size from about 3.7 kb to 7.2 kb (fig. 7). apart from the ecori/avai restriction sites which characterize the repeated sequence, there is a notable lack of common restriction sites within these elements. these results suggest that the elements do possess a certain degree of structural similarity but significant evolutionary divergence has occurred. the presence and location of the directly repeated sequences, their association with specific deletions, and their association with an antibiotic-resistance determinant, are features common to many antibiotic-resistance transposons described for other prokaryotes. in addition, these elements are highly mobile, being found on a number of r-plasmids. the unique relationship between pbf4, pbi106, and pbi136 described here is a clear indication of the potential for these dna sequences to move from one molecule to  another. given the extensive dissemination and the genetic and structural characteristics described above, it seems likely that the lm-resistance determinant is carried on transposon-like elements present in pbf4, pbftm10, and  pbi136. however, further experimentation will be necessary to document the transposition event. bacteroides strains such as b. fragilis v503, possess a transmissible lm-resistance determinant which does not appear to be associated with detectable extrachromosomal elements (5,9,10). presently, a number of strains of this type have been found over a wide geographic area. the lm-resistance genes associated with these strains are apparently similar to the one carried on the bacteroides r-plasmids because homology between the 2 has been observed. however, it is important to note that within the limits of southern filter blot hybridization, neither v503 nor its transconjugants possess the directly repeated sequence found on the lm-resistance plasmids (fig. 8). the elusive nature of the v503 lm-resistance elements presents an intriguing problem. one model that has been proposed is that these resistance determinants reside on  a conjugative transposon similar to tn916 of streptococcus faecalis (3).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  == a review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. an evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean mic90 being  less than 8 mg/l. the mic90 for cocci, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. the mic90 for all enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only pseudomonas maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic  resistance. imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the mic usually being below 1 mg/l even for bacteroides fragilis. rare bacteria such as nocardia asteroides, listeria monocytogenes or fast growing mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. in most species the mbc only slightly exceeded the mic; however in the case of streptococcus faecalis the mbc value was many times the mic value. synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

AB  == many patients with crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. the author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with crohn's disease in 27% of cases. furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for crohn's disease. the principal bacteria isolated at these sites were escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, proteus sp and diphtheroids. a prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. these interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with crohn's disease.

TI  == gram's stains of tracheal secretions predict neonatal bacteremia.
AB  == the presence of bacteria in tracheal secretions stained by the gram method was evaluated as a method of predicting neonatal bacteremia. the presence of bacteria had a 74% sensitivity and a 47% predictive accuracy in identifying neonates with  bacteremia before 12 hours of age. the specificity in predicting newborns without bacteremia was 98%. in the same neonates, an immature neutrophil-total neutrophil ratio of 0.2 or more had a 77% sensitivity in predicting neonates with bacteremia. neonates with bacteria in their blood and tracheal aspirates, who died shortly after birth, had pneumonia on postmortem examination. in newborns who have respiratory distress and a risk of infection at birth, gram's stains of  tracheal secretions are a practical and useful method of predicting congenital bacteremia.

TI  == experimental anaerobic brain abscess. computerized tomographic and neuropathological correlations.
AB  == the neuropathological progression of brain abscess formation induced by a mixed anaerobic culture of bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus epidermidis was studied experimentally in dogs. histological findings were correlated with computerized tomographic (ct) brain scans. the evolution of brain abscess formation could be divided into three stages based on histological criteria: early cerebritis (days 1 to 3); late cerebritis (days 4 to 9); and capsule formation (day 10 and later). capsule formation could not be divided into early and late stages because encapsulation was delayed compared with a previously reported model of alpha-streptococcus brain abscess. histologically, there was evidence for a very virulent infection. leptomeningitis was significant even in the late stages. early ventricular rupture occurred in 25% of the animals. a pattern of extensive purulent encephalitis was seen in 25% of the animals. in the early cerebritis stage, blood vessels near the necrotic center were engorged and  were surrounded by hemorrhage and/or protein-rich fluid. cerebral edema was extensive. although fibroblasts appeared in late cerebritis, there was marked delay of capsule formation. three-week-old lesions still had areas of incomplete  capsule formation and foci of uncontrolled infection. in the cerebritis stages, ct scans showed an area of ring enhancement which was incomplete on early scans (at 5 minutes after injection of contrast material) but partially filled in and thickened on delayed scans (at 20 to 45 minutes). on even later delayed scans there was no decrease in intensity of ring enhancement. lesions in which capsule  formation occurred also showed ring enhancement, but delayed scans showed a decrease in the intensity of enhancement. the lesions that ruptured into the ventricular system showed atypical ct findings, with either lack of contrast enhancement (histologically there was minimal cerebritis adjacent to the abscess  cavity) or a marked delay in contrast enhancement (cerebritis was more extensive  and corresponded to the width of ring of enhancement). this study suggests that bacteroides fragilis is a virulent organism in the brain. the developing abscesses enlarged quickly, were prone to early ventricular rupture, and showed incomplete and delayed encapsulation.

TI  == the effect of capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide of bacteroides fragilis on polymorph function and serum killing.
AB  == the determinant responsible for the ability of bacteroides spp. to inhibit polymorph phagocytic killing of aerobic organisms has not yet been identified. therefore, the roles of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide of b. fragilis were investigated. serum-resistant and serum-sensitive strains of proteus mirabilis were used to indicate inhibition of phagocytic killing and serum killing of aerobes. whole organisms of b. fragilis, purified lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide were added to an in-vitro phagocytosis system. results showed that greater than 10(7) bacteroides/ml inhibited both serum and phagocytic killing. concentrations below 10(7)/ml had little effect on either process. purified capsular polysaccharide (10 or 100 micrograms/ml), either alone in the system or in combination with sub-inhibitory  concentrations of b. fragilis also markedly inhibited serum and phagocytic killing. lipopolysaccharide (9 micrograms/ml) appeared relatively inert. b. ovatus, reputedly non-capsulated, produced identical results to those obtained with b. fragilis, but an encapsulated strain of streptococcus pneumoniae did not  inhibit serum or phagocytic killing.

TI  == activity of cefotaxime against enterococci.
AB  == the third-generation cephalosporins as a group are characterized by spectra of activity that are the broadest of the currently available antibiotics (farber and moellering, 1982). these agents provide excellent coverage of infections due to enterobacteriaceae. they also exhibit good (but variable) activity against a number of "nonfermentors" such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many of them are likewise active against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis (farber and moellering, 1982). as a class, the third generation cephalosporins are less active against gram-positive organisms, but in spite of this they have been clinically effective against infections due to s. aureus and many other gram-positive cocci (saito, 1982). enterococci, however, have proven to be a difficult organism for the third-generation cephalosporins. none of the presently available compounds exhibits very good activity against these organisms in vitro  (fass, 1983). given this fact and the broad spectrum of activity of these compounds against other organisms, there is a significant potential for enterococcal superinfection in patients treated with the third-generation cephalosporins. indeed, serious enterococcal infection has clearly been documented in patients treated with some third-generation cephalosporins (moellering, 1982; yu, 1981). although none of the presently available third-generation cephalosporins exhibits therapeutically useful activity against  enterococci, currently available data suggest that there may be differences among these compounds in their ability to cause (or prevent) this complication. for instance, there are more published reports of enterococcal superinfection in patients treated with moxalactam than in patients receiving the other third-generation cephalosporins.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime: an example of advantageous antimicrobial metabolism.
AB  == although the antibacterial activity of desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx), the principal metabolite of cefotaxime (ctx), is eightfold lower than cefotaxime, the metabolite inhibits many b-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and unusual pseudomonas species resistant to agents such as cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefoperazone. des-ctx is more stable than ctx to attack by beta-lactamases of some species such as bacteroides fragilis, proteus vulgaris, and the k-1 enzyme of enterobacter-klebsiella. des-ctx acts synergistically with ctx against many enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity of the  combination of ctx/des-ctx indicates that the drug can be administered every 8-12 hr and provides excellent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of desacetylcefotaxime compared to other related beta-lactams.
AB  == like all other cephalosporins that contain an acetyl side chain in the 3' position, cefotaxime (ctx) is partially desacetylated in vivo. desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high beta-lactamase stability. with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus, most strains of other species tested usually had mean mics of des-ctx lower than 1 microgram/ml. its activity is generally lower than that of the parent compound. it was only against some strains of p. cepacia that des-ctx surpassed the activity of ctx. the activity of des-ctx markedly exceeds the activity of many therapeutically used cephalosporins. this is especially true for haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, most species of enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci other than streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

TI  == ceftizoxime: a beta-lactamase-stable, broad-spectrum cephalosporin. pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and clinical use.
AB  == ceftizoxime is an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that inhibits a wide  variety of aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml as are streptococcal species with the exception of streptococcus faecalis. staphylococcus aureus are inhibited by 3-8 micrograms/ml, while methicillin-resistant. aureus are resistant. bacteroides fragilis are inhibited by 16-64 micrograms/ml. it inhibits pseudomonas aeruginosa at usually achievable  concentrations. ceftizoxime is overall similar in antibacterial activity to cefotaxime and moxalactam. ceftizoxime is not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. serum levels of ceftizoxime after intramuscular and  intravenous injection are similar to those of cefotaxime and moxalactam. the half-life is 1.6 to 1.9 hours in normal individuals. the compound is not metabolized and is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. ceftizoxime enters most body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, to produce therapeutic concentrations against clinically important bacteria. ceftizoxime accumulates in the presence of renal failure, but it is removed from the body by  hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. ceftizoxime has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent when used as treatment for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis, gonorrhea,  including penicillinase-producing isolates, and gynecological infections. no major adverse reactions have been associated with the use of ceftizoxime and it has produced neither disulfram -like reactions nor bleeding.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  == the preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. the most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, u-57,930e), in which the (2s-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2s-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. this structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and plasmodium berghei. pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and  mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. it readily penetrates b. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses.  a drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. urinary  excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.

TI  == cholecystitis--etiology and treatment--microbiological aspects.
AB  == acute cholecystitis is initially a chemical inflammation, but regularly complicated by bacterial invasion from the gut. escherichia coli, klebsiella and  streptococcus faecalis dominate among aerobic bacteria, whereas bacteroides fragilis and clostridia are commonly encountered anaerobes. mixed infections are  prevalent. bactibilia occurs in at least 60% of the early stage of acute cholecystitis and is particularly prevalent in the elderly. also, bactibilia is very common in recurrent cholecystitis. a close connection is found between the presence of bactibilia and infectious complications. although antimicrobial treatment does not sterilize the bile of an obstructed gall bladder, most authors favour such treatment in cases of febrile cholecystitis, particularly in the elderly, in order to prevent septic complications. various regimens of preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis have significantly reduced the infectious  complications, in spite of persistent bactibilia. prophylactic courses should not exceed one or two days, one single preoperative dose is probably adequate. the choice of antimicrobial drugs for prophylaxis varies with local experience and patterns of bacterial resistance. a combination of broad spectred betalactam antibiotics and nitroimidazole would generally seem to provide an appropriate and atoxic coverage.

TI  == [in vitro activity of several cytostatic drugs against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria].
AB  == the human normal intestinal flora prevents the colonization of exogenous bacteria, maintaining a constant microecology: this property is called "colonization resistance". in leukemia patients antibiotics used for prevention and/or therapy of infectious episodes can alter the intestinal microecology, so that the gut can represent the trigger zone for generalized septicemia. moreover  cytotoxic drugs used in these patients can favour intestinal disturbances. in our study we evaluated the in vitro activity of three commonly used antineoplastic drugs (daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate) against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria and clostridium difficile that is the aetiological  agent of pseudomembranous colitis. daunorubicin proved to be the most active inhibiting, in concentration ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, 50% of bacteroides strains and 90% of clostridium difficile and enterococci strains tested. methotrexate showed activity only against some bacteroides strains, while cytosine arabinoside had no activity at all. we conclude that in these patients the use of these drugs may represent another factor of risk altering the intestinal flora and so lowering the colonization resistance.

TI  == in-vivo protection of group a beta-haemolytic streptococci from penicillin by beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides species.
AB  == the incidence of persistent group a beta-haemolytic streptococci in tonsils, despite penicillin therapy, has increased in recent years. beta-lactamase-producing organisms have previously been recovered from 74% of patients with persisting group a streptococci. we investigated the possibility that beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides spp. can protect streptococci from penicillin. a mixed infection was induced in mice in the form of a subcutaneous abscess involving a penicillin-susceptible group a streptococcus, and a beta-lactamase-producing strain of either bact. melaninogenicus or bact. fragilis. the infected animals were treated for seven days with parenteral penicillin, penicillin and clavulanic acid or clindamycin. penicillin treatment prevented the formation of abscesses in animals inoculated with group a streptococci alone, but not in those inoculated with group a streptococci and bacteroides spp. we attributed this resistance to penicillin therapy, and the subsequent formation of abscesses in mice, to protection of the  streptococci from penicillin by beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides spp. effective therapy for mixed infections was achieved when clavulanic acid, a  beta-lactamase inhibitor, was administered with penicillin. a similar effect was  noted with clindamycin, which is active against both group a streptococci and bacteroides spp.

TI  == moxalactam (latamoxef). a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == moxalactam (latamoxef) is a new synthetic oxa-beta-lactam antibiotic administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, is particularly active against enterobacteriaceae and is resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. moxalactam has moderate activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but on the basis of present evidence can not be recommended as sole antibiotic treatment of known or suspected pseudomonal infections. like the related compounds, the cephalosporins, moxalactam is effective in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. as moxalactam is also active against bacteroides fragilis it has considerable potential in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in patients with normal immunological mechanisms, as well as in immunocompromised patients, when used alone or in combination with other antibiotics. likewise, its ready penetration into the diseased central nervous system, its high level of activity against gram-negative bacilli, and the lack of necessity to monitor drug plasma concentrations, indicate its potential value in  the treatment of neonatal gram-negative bacillary meningitis. further clinical experience is needed before it can be determined whether moxalactam alone can be  used in the treatment of conditions for which the aminoglycosides are drugs of choice, but if established as equally effective, moxalactam has the advantage of  being devoid of nephrotoxicity. bleeding is a potentially serious problem, however, particularly in the elderly, malnourished and in the presence of renal impairment.

AB  == fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to  the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.

TI  == increase in immunoglobulin m antibodies against gut bacteria during acute hepatitis a.
AB  == the marked increase in the total serum immunoglobulin m (igm) is a characteristic feature of acute hepatitis a. to study the nature of this igm, we assayed serial  titers of igm antibodies against various antigens during and after acute hepatitis a. the antibodies against blood group antigen remained unchanged throughout the observation period. thus, the production or metabolism of igm was  not nonspecifically altered. the igm antibody against hepatitis a antigen decreased and finally disappeared during convalescence as expected. however, its  time course did not correlate quantitatively with the concentration of the total  serum igm. in contrast, igm antibodies against gut bacteria bacteroides fragilis  and streptococcus faecalis were considerably elevated in all patients at the onset of the disease, and they normalized similarly to the total igm during convalescence. igm antibodies against escherichia coli were elevated only in some of the patients. the data suggest that the amount of igm antibodies against gut bacteria contributes significantly to the increase in the total serum igm in acute hepatitis a.

TI  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was employed. n-f thienamycin was active against all enterobacteriaceae isolates (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. n-f thienamycin was also active against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and gram-positive cocci. all enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. the drug was active against haemophilus influenzae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and  the bacteroides fragilis group (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). cefoxitin was inactive against most enterobacter and a. calcoaceticus isolates and all p. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. tobramycin was virtually inactive against gram-positive cocci other than staphylococcus aureus. n-f thienamycin thus has a  broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.

TI  == clinical evaluation of moxalactam: evidence of decreased efficacy in gram-positive aerobic infections.
AB  == moxalactam was used as initial, empirical therapy in 69 patients with a variety of serious bacterial infections, 32% of which were accompanied by bacteremia. overall, the success rate was 83% and drug-related adverse effects were minimal.  the drug was less efficacious in infections caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens than it was in those caused by gram-negative pathogens. the following gram-positive organisms were associated with special problems during moxalactam therapy: streptococcus pneumoniae (development of meningitis and a relapse of pneumonia with a more resistant strain), staphylococcus epidermidis (in vivo emergence of moxalactam resistance, and the enterococci (failure of therapy and a fatal superinfection. moxalactam performed well in infections caused by most gram-negative organisms, including aminoglycoside-resistant strains, but the previously reported emergence of gram-negative bacillary resistance to moxalactam during therapy was reconfirmed in our series with serratia marcescens. the use of moxalactam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis was further supported by  a patient with meningitis-ventriculitis caused by bacteroides fragilis who was cured with moxalactam after failure on chloramphenicol.

TI  == prostaglandin cytoprotection and lysosomal stability in acute canine gastric erosions.
AB  == prostaglandin cytoprotection may be related to lysosomal stability. in six mongrel dogs, bacterial peritonitis was created by the intraperitoneal instillation of bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae in addition to canine gallbladder bile. in three dogs, gallbladder bile alone was instilled. three of the six dogs with bacterial peritonitis also received 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin e2 (pge2) (0.2 micrograms/kg intramuscularly q6h) 24 hours before and for 3 days after the induction of peritonitis. in the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving pge2, gastroscopic examination demonstrated acute fundic erosions. none of the other dogs developed acute gastric erosions. in the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving pge2, fundic mucosal biopsy specimens demonstrated decreased lysosomal stability. in the dogs receiving pge2, lysosomal stability was similar to that in the animals with bile peritonitis. these experiments demonstrate that pge2 prevents the development of acute gastric erosions by stabilizing lysosomal membranes.

AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity, beta-lactamase stability and beta-lactamase inhibition of cefotetan and other 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactam antimicrobials.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams were compared to cefoperazone and ceftriaxone. all had a similar spectrum of activity against the  enterobacteriaceae, except cefoxitin. cefotetan was only slightly less active than moxalactam against the enterobacter spp. ceftriaxone was most effective on neisserias, haemophilus spp, nonenterococcal streptococcus spp, and acinetobacter spp. cefoperazone generally inhibited more pseudomonads while all of the "cephamycins" showed activity against bacteroides fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron. beta-lactamase hydrolysis studies of six substrates having pharmacologic serum half lives of greater than or equal to 2 hrs were performed by bioassay and automated procedures. excellent correlations were found between methods up to 24 hrs. a "lag-phase" was observed for several drug/enzyme combinations before initiation of significant substrate hydrolysis. the 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams were routinely more stable to the six representative enzymes (richmond-sykes types i-v) than other "stable" cephalosporins. substrate  hydrolysis rates resulting in greater than 50% drug loss in less than or equal to 1 hr generally produced resistant in vitro test results. cefotetan, cefoxitin, moxalactam, ceftriaxone, and dicloxacillin were potent inhibitors of type i (p99) beta-lactamases. moxalactam demonstrated significant inhibition and affinity for  the type v enzyme while cefoperazone uniquely possesses affinity (so-called inhibition) for all tested beta-lactamases. cefotetan appears to be a promising,  beta-lactam compound with some in vitro characteristics comparable to the 1-oxa-beta-lactams and alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporins.

TI  == cefoperazone: a review of its antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase stability, enzyme inhibition, and other in vitro characteristics.
AB  == the in vitro qualities of cefoperazone were reviewed on the basis of international medical literature and some new observations. cefoperazone is highly active against the enterobacteriaceae. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is comparable to that of the other newer cephem antibiotics. cefoperazone  is also active against all beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae and is relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci. against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefoperazone is at least fourfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam and is approximately as active as azlocillin or piperacillin. haemophilus and neisseria species, regardless of beta-lactamase production, are highly susceptible to cefoperazone. against the bacteroides fragilis group, cefoperazone is either very active or quite inactive  because of endemic variations. the drug is slightly less stable to some beta-lactamases than are cefotaxime-like or 7-methoxy cephem drugs. cefoperazone  is a bactericidal beta-lactam, and its minimal inhibitory concentrations are influenced only by high inoculum concentrations of beta-lactamase-producing strains. its ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes appears similar to that of cefotaxime. synergy studies with cefoperazone plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa show enhanced killing. cefoperazone is 70%-94% protein bound and has high affinities for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins 3, 1a, 2, and 1 bs.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate  activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to  or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86%  according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus intermedius and group b streptococci in ascending infection of pregnancy. an animal experimental study.
AB  == by means of bacteriological, histological and immunofluorescence methods, the ascending spread of endocervically inoculated bacteria was studied in 14 pregnant sheep. 8 ewes near term were exposed to group b streptococci, bacteroides fragilis or streptococcus intermedius for 2-4 days. 6 other animals in mid pregnancy were exposed to one of the bacteria mentioned for 30 days. before inoculation, aerobic and anaerobic culture specimens from cervix and amniotic fluid were obtained. at delivery by caesarean section, in addition to culture specimens, membrane and placental tissues were collected. bacterial detection by  means of indirect immunofluorescence showed significant invasion of the membranes and the placentas by the microorganisms inoculated. in one case, inoculated with  s. intermedius, the ascending infection could be shown to pass the intact membranes reaching the amniotic fluid. it is concluded that endocervical bacteria in the indigenous microflora might cause pregnancy complications by establishing  ascending infection. furthermore, as the bacteria tested have been implicated in  premature rupture of the membranes, an aetiological role of ascending infection in this pregnancy complication is postulated.

TI  == in vitro protection of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci from penicillin and cephalothin by bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == beta-lactamase produced by bacteroides fragilis could protect from antibiotics group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), penicillin-susceptible pathogens frequently isolated from acute tonsillitis in children. to test this hypothesis we determined the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to penicillin and cephalothin of gabhs alone and in mixed culture with eleven beta-lactamase-producing strains of b. fragilis. b. fragilis strains with mbc values less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml to penicillin and less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml to cephalothin did not provide any protection for gabhs. however, strains with mbc greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml to penicillin and greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml to cephalothin provided protection by increasing the mbc of gabhs at least 8,534 times for penicillin and 2,048 times for cephalothin. this phenomenon was most marked in 5% co2. b. fragilis provided no protection against clindamycin. these results may explain the inability of penicillin therapy to completely eradicate gabhs from cases of recurrently infected tonsils.

TI  == cefotetan, a new cephamycin: comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activity with other cephems, beta-lactamase stability, and preliminary recommendations for disk diffusion testing.
AB  == cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). the in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against  12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci  to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those  of cefoxitin and cefamandole. no useful activity was present against streptococcus faecalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes types i, iii, and iv beta-lactamases. hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin padac (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin)  by type i beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.

TI  == cefotaxime: a review of in vitro antimicrobial properties and spectrum of activity.
AB  == cefotaxime has remarkable potency against all enterobacteriaceae, including enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and providencia species--all of which are resistant to earlier cephalosporins. cefotaxime generally inhibits greater than 90% of enteric bacilli at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml; in one study it inhibited greater than 98% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. for staphylococci and nonenterococcal streptococci, the mean values for the minimal inhibitory concentration50 (mic50) of cefotaxime (i.e., the lowest concentration inhibiting growth of 50% of tested strains) are 1.1-1.9  microgram/ml and 0.01-0.05 microgram/ml, respectively. cefotaxime is inactive against streptococcus faecalis and most other serogroup d streptococci. it is moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 19 microgram/ml) and acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus (mic50, 18 microgram/ml). because the activity of cefotaxime against other pseudomonads and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli varies, in vitro susceptibility testing must be used as a guide to therapy. cefotaxime is potent against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria species. infections due to beta-lactamase-producing gonococci have been treated effectively with cefotaxime (mic, mode = less than or equal to 0.004 microgram/ml). most anaerobes are highly susceptible to cefotaxime, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 10%-20% of bacteroides fragilis strains (mic50, 5.3 microgram/ml) and other bacteroides species may exceed obtainable serum concentrations. the potent antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime appears to  be the result of a combination of characteristics which include: beta-lactamase stability (types i, iii, iv, and v), good ability to pass through the cell membrane, strong affinity for lethal penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 1b(s), and 3, minimal limitation by the inoculum effect, and bactericidal action at or close to the inhibitory concentration. clinically useful methods of susceptibility testing have been developed and can be recommended for clinical laboratory use.

AB  == the antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (mezlin) and piperacillin (pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. following  i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. however, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. piperacillin is also effective for bone and  joint infections. dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. the potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their  extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. more comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.

TI  == obturator foramen grafts: the preferable alternate route?
AB  == although the femoral canal is the standard entrance route for vascular grafts to  the lower extremity, several situations may arise that preclude the use of this route. in these circumstances an alternate pathway for revascularization is required. experience in our center with the use of obturator foramen grafts for revascularization of nine limbs in eight patients is reported and underscores the value of this pathway as an alternative route for limb revascularization. the obturator foramen was employed to circumvent an infected arterial prosthesis at the groin level in seven patients (eight limbs) from 12 days to 4.5 years after the initial vascular procedure. the organisms responsible for graft infection included staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides fragilis. the final patient required iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass via the obturator foramen to manage occlusion and autolysis of the femoral artery by a mycotic embolus containing beta-hemolytic streptococcus. graft material used for  these remedial procedures, included saphenous vein (three), gore-tex (three), and dacron (three). revascularization was satisfactory in each case. each groin infection healed. two patients died of unrelated causes at 1.5 and 5 months after operation. the seven remaining grafts at risk (six patients) remained patent 12 months in each case. four grafts were doing well at 18, 36, 50, and 52 months. three grafts failed at 13, 19, and 28 months; one was revised successfully, one was re-done and failed again. obturator foramen bypass grafting provides satisfactory and durable revascularization when an alternate route to the lower extremity is required.

TI  == chemoprophylaxis of anaerobic pulmonary infections. an experimental study in rabbits.
AB  == chemoprophylaxis of anaerobic pulmonary infection due to aspiration was studied in a rabbit model with the view of comparing the efficacy of procaine penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline and cefoxitin. the antibiotic treatment was commenced immediately following transtracheal inoculation of a mixture of bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus morbillorum, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium lentum. treatment was stopped after 48 h and lungs were examined for  evidence of infection on the 10th day. only clindamycin and carbencillin were highly efficacious in chemoprophylaxis and both drugs prevented pulmonary infection in 7 of 8 (87%) of the animals tested.

TI  == effect of linolenyl alcohol on the in-vitro growth of the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the effect of primary aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length and degree of unsaturation on bacterial growth was assessed, using strep. mutans bht as the main test organism. unsaturated alcohols, linoleyl and linolenyl, effectively inhibited bacterial growth. of the saturated alcohols, only lauryl and myristyl alcohols inhibited the growth of strep. mutans bht, but at concentrations much higher than those required for the unsaturated alcohols. all gram-positive organisms tested were sensitive to linolenyl alcohol. gram-negative bacteria did  not exhibit the sensitivity. linoleic and linolenic acid were inactive as antibacterial agents at the same concentration as the related alcohol. repeated exposure of strep. mutans bht to linolenyl alcohol produced no change in the sensitivity of the organism to the alcohol. significant amounts of linolenyl alcohol were found in bacteria grown in the presence of this lipid for 24 h but linolenic acid was not detected. thus the primary polyunsaturated aliphatic alcohols, particularly linolenyl alcohol, could be effective antibacterial agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.

TI  == classification of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-b-type antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == we have examined the relationship between the genes specifying resistance towards macrolid-lincosamide-streptogramin-b-type (mls) antibiotics from group d and h streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, and bacteroides fragilis by dna annealing. we detected homology between the mls resistance determinants from the gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci) but not between these and the genes from b. licheniformis and b. fragilis. based on these dna-dna hybridizations and on data obtained from the literature, at least four distinct classes of mls r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci, class c for b. licheniformis and class d and b. fragilis. these genetic classes did not correlate with differences in phenotypic  expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mls antibiotics. these findings are in favor of a recent common origin of r determinants in streptococci and staphylococci but do not suggest that gene transfer may occur between gram-positive cocci and anaerobes (b. fragilis) despite the fact that these pathogenic bacterial genera share common human eco-systems.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of ceftazidime (gr-20263) and other beta-lactamase  stable cephalosporins against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was determined against 586 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by an agar-dilution technique and compared with that of cefuroxime, moxalactam and cefoxitin. at 16 mg/l, only 60% of all isolates were inhibited by ceftazidime, compared to 79% by cefuroxime, 81% by moxalactam and 80% by cefoxitin. ceftazidime was relatively inactive against bacteroides fragilis group, lactobacillus and clostridium species other than cl. perfringens. peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, cl. perfringens, microaerophilic streptococci and propionibacterium were readily inhibited. moxalactam was the most active agent against bact. fragilis group, while cefuroxime was the most active agent against streptococcus and lactobacillus.

TI  == the upper vaginal and cervical anaerobic flora in menopausal women.
AB  == the upper vaginal and cervical bacterial flora, especially the anaerobic one which has a particular role in postoperative morbidity, was studied in 78 menopausal women between 48 and 78 yr of age. the aim of the present study was to compare the results obtained with those reported for bacterial flora in women of  other age groups. the patients were divided into the following 3 groups. (i) twenty-eight healthy women with a natural menopause; (ii) 30 women, 2-6 mth after surgical menopause due to panhysterectomy; and (iii) 20 menopausal women 3 mth after vaginal hysterectomy. 30.7% of the cultures were found to be sterile. the anaerobic bacteria, developed only in the presence of aerobic germs, represented  11.5% of the total number of cultures and was found to be formed by streptococcus bacteroides sp. and bacteroides fragilis. the vaginal flora of menopausal women is not different from that found in children, young women, in pregnancy or postpartum. the anaerobic germs isolated in our study are normal inhabitants of the vagina and cervix which may occasionally become pathogens.

TI  == [moxalactam - a beta-lactam antibiotic in the monotherapy of severe infections in surgery. clinico-bacteriological study of 35 patients].
AB  == moxalactam, a new beta-lactam antibiotic, was given to 35 patients at the department of surgery, cantonal hospital, st. gall. the trial period started in april 1980 and ended in october. moxalactam was not combined with any other antibiotic. the clinical course was observed closely and extensive bacteriological, mycological, and pharmacokinetic studies were carried out to evaluate the new antibiotic. most of the patients had an intra-abdominal infectious disease and primary treatment was surgery. the antibiotic therapy was  started at surgery. a total of 290 different bacteria could be isolated from the  35 patients. 220 isolates were aerobic and 7 0 anaerobic. the minimal inhibitory  concentration was calculated for every isolate. in addition, the serum levels of  moxalactam was determined in almost every patient. in 31 patients (88.6%) the therapy was successful, in 2 patients no evaluation was possible and in 2 patients the therapy was unsuccessful, including one patient with a primarily moxalactam-resistant bacteroides fragilis responsible for sepsis. in some patients a massive increase in candida was noted in the urine, stool, or wound drainage. primarily moxalactam-resistant organisms, such as streptococcus faecalis, were often found alone in the samples taken later in the course of therapy. an extraordinary change in the fecal flora could be observed during therapy, but no clinical complications resulted. no specific antifungal therapy nor any additional antibiotic against streptococcus faecalis was necessary. moxalactam was well tolerated and side effects were minimal. no impairment of renal function was noticed.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam  were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against  staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == isolation and significance of anaerobic bacteria isolated from cases of bovine mastitis.
AB  == the role of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the aetiology of mastitis of lactating dairy cows was investigated. anaerobes were isolated from 12% of lactating mastitic cows, which were representative of 50% of the 10 dairy herds examined. bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently isolated organism of (50%), followed by peptococcus indolicus (33%), eubacterium lentum (33%), e. aerofaciens (17%), propionibacterium granulosum (17%) and an anaerobic streptococcus sp. (17%). these obligate anaerobes were always isolated together with organisms classically involved in mastitis. it was possible to induce overt clinical mastitis in healthy lactating udders within 24 hours by infection with single pure cultures of anaerobes via the teat canal. all b. fragilis strains were resistant to penicillin g and tetracycline. in addition, one strain was also resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin. anaerobic gram positive cocci and bacilli were sensitive to most antibiotics. these findings imply an important role for anaerobes in the aetiology of mastitis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

AB  == the predominant potential pathogens in the vaginal flora, sampled before operation in 41 patients undergoing gynaecological surgery, included e. coli, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, streptococcus faecalis, anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacteroides fragilis. all the aerobic gram-negative bacilli and 89.7 per cent of the streptococci isolated were sensitive to 4 microgram/ml of cefuroxime. most of the anaerobes were also very sensitive to cefuroxime, although the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for 52 per cent of b, fragilis isolates was at least 8 microgram/ml. the mic of metronidazole was less  than 1 microgram/ml for almost all anaerobes. all patients were given 1 g of metronidazole by suppository on the night before operation and a second suppository was given, together with 750 mg of cefuroxime injected intramuscularly with the premedication. the mean extravascular tissue concentrations of cefuroxime and metronidazole, assayed in 29 patients, were respectively 8.9 and 8.0 microgram/g (uterus), 14.2 and 22.3 microgram/g (cervix), 13.1 and 6.3 microgram/g (fallopian tube), 12.3 and 2.1 microgram/g (ovary), 10.3 and 12.4 microgram/g (vagina), 13.3 and 13.7 microgram/ml (serum),  3570.3 and 122.3 microgram/ml (urine). none of the patients developed postoperative wound infections or adverse reactions.

TI  == therapeutic efficacy of 29 antimicrobial regimens in experimental intraabdominal  sepsis.
AB  == an animal model of colonic perforation was used to examine the efficacy of 29 antimicrobial regimens in the treatment of intraabdominal sepsis. efficacy was judged on mortality during the first 12 days after challenge and on the incidence of intraabdominal abscess noted at necropsy upon completion of the experiment. in general, antimicrobial agents that are active against coliform bacteria prevented early mortality, whereas drugs that are active against bacteroides fragilis were  most effective in reducing the incidence of late abscess formation. exceptions were metronidazole, which produced a significant reduction in early mortality, and chloramphenicol, which caused only a modest reduction in the incidence of abscess. optimal results were obtained with several regimens that showed good in  vitro activity against both coliforms and b. fragilis.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

(10,  including two b. fragilis); fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and actinomyces sp. (five isolates). a total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five gram-positive cocci and three haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. five patients, four with  sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not  respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

AB  == oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (ha) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of ha-active f. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. ha-active sonicated fragments (sf) prepared from f. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. attachment of f. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the ha activity of the sf in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. ha activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of f. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment.  of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed f. nucleatum ha-active fragments. they included bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, bacteroides corrodens, streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus sanguis (blackburn and jc 74) and streptococcus mutans aht, bht, 10449 and 6715. chelators revealed that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a ca2+-dependent interaction. sugar inhibition demonstrated that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a d-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. a reduction in the absorption of f. nucleatum ha-active fragments by strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

TI  == amniotic fluid activity against bacteroides fragilis and group b streptococci.
AB  == the antimicrobial capacity of amniotic fluid (af) against b. fragilis, group b streptococci and escherichia coli, the latter as a reference indicator, was investigated in samples from 30 patients. in order to study trimester as well as  individual variations in the antibacterial activity, 10 individual samples from each trimester of pregnancy (af1, af2, af3), were separately tested. with b. fragilis all trimester samples showed initial inhibition lasting for 8 h, the bacteria then regaining growth capacity in all af1, and the majority of af2 and af3 specimens. however, 4 af2 and 3 af3 samples showed continued bacteriostatic activity for up to 24 h. group b streptococci exhibited uninhibited growth in all trimester samples. the growth of e. coli in af1 and af2 was not inhibited, whereas in af3 a temporary arrest was observed at 8 h, this being followed by growth to control levels at 24 h. the findings may explain the frequent isolation of b. fragilis from cases of septic abortions during the first trimester. individual variation in the effectiveness of the antibacterial activity against b. fragilis in af2 and af3 may explain why this microorganism, which is often implicated in severe maternal and neonatal infections, is occasionally recovered  from the mother's endocervix without signs of disease. the inefficacy of af in defence against group b streptococci correlates well with the frequent isolation  of these bacteria from cases of severe congenital infections associated with premature delivery.

AB  == this study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. bacterial growth occurred  in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. there were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). the predominant isolates were: e. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); group d streptococcus (12 specimens); and p. aeruginosa (9 specimens). there were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). the predominant isolates were: 157 bacteroides spp. (including 92 b. fragilis group and 26 b. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 peptococcus sp.; 29 peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 fusobactenium sp.; and 16 clostridium sp. b. fragilis and peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. these included all isolates of b. fragilis and six of the 23 bacteroides sp. forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. the predominant organisms were: b. fragilis (8 specimens); e. coli (6 specimens); peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of  cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all proteus species. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. it was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than  ampicillin against both bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from b. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of enterobacter cloacae.

TI  == moxalactam (ly127935), a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam antibiotic with remarkable antimicrobial activity: in vitro comparison with cefamandole and tobramycin.
AB  == moxalactam (ly127935) exhibited greater in vitro activity than cefamandole and tobramycin against clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila, and pseudomonas maltophilia. the activities of the three drugs against other microorganisms were as follows: for staphylococci, cefamandole = tobramycin greater than moxalactam; for streptococci, cefamandole greater than moxalactam greater than tobramycin; and for pseudomonas aeruginosa, tobramycin greater than  moxalactam greater than cefamandole. moxalactam also demonstrated significant activity against the bacteroides fragilis group and other anaerobes. moxalactam was comparable to cefotaxime (hr756) in its inhibition of cephalothin-resistant and aminoglycoside-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935) with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 420 blood culture isolates.
AB  == to compare the in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, each drug was tested against 420 bacterial isolates from the blood of septic patients. standard broth dilution methods were  used to determine minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. ly127935 was as active as the aminoglycosides against aerobic gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was at least 10-fold more active than the other beta-lactam agents against these bacteria. ly127935 was the most active agent tested against bacteroides fragilis; its activity against all other anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of the other agents tested. all streptococci, however, grew at higher concentrations of ly127935 than any other drug, and streptococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes were not inhibited at the highest concentration tested (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 64 microgram/ml). although a greater proportion of blood culture isolates were susceptible to ly127935 than to any other drug tested, ly127935 does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of in vitro activity to be recommended safely alone for empirical treatment of sepsis of unknown etiology.

TI  == microbiological findings in pregnant women with premature rupture of the membranes.
AB  == from 30 consecutive cases of premature rupture of the membranes (prom) and matched controls, specimens from urine, cervix, amniotic fluid, and placenta as well as neonatal nose and throat swabs were investigated bacteriologically and virologically. in addition virus serological investigation was done. among the prom cases the anaerobic cervical isolates outnumbered the aerobic ones, and the  total number of aerobic as well as anaerobic isolates was less in the control group. the anaerobes b. fragilis and strept. intermedius were isolated from the cervix, amniotic fluid, or placenta in 23% and 30% of the prom patients, respectively. none of the controls harboured b. fragilis, while strept. intermedius was isolated from 6.7% of the controls. group b streptococci were recovered from the mother's cervix in 20% of the prom patients and in 6.7% among  the controls. four cases of neonatal septicaemia were encountered, and another two cases were clinically suspected, but not microbiologically verified, contributing to a high perinatal mortality rate (17,6%). of the prom patients, 27% developed puerperal infection, while none of the control mothers had such complications. the significance of the anaerobic bacteria as well as group b streptococci for the maternal and neonatal outcome in cases of prom is discussed, and a possible aetiological role of ascending infection in this complication of pregnancy is postulated.

TI  == cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. the antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as staphylococcus aureus. other pathogens included streptococcus epidermidis, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as bacteroides fragilis. the drug was well tolerated. pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == bacteriology of rattlesnake venom and implications for therapy.
AB  == although the incidence of infection secondary to the bites of venomous snakes remains unknown, the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is advocated. in this study, the venom from 15 rattlesnakes was cultured, and 58 aerobic and 28 anaerobic strains of bacteria were isolated. the most common species isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, coagulase-negative staphylocci, and clostridium species. bacteroides fragilis was also recovered. when the fang sheaths of four additional rattlesnakes were retracted and the fangs of these snakes decontaminated, 50% of the samples of venom had no bacterial growth (p = 0.035). until a clinical study is performed, the use of antimicrobial therapy that reflects that complex oral flora of rattlesnakes is still recommended in most cases of envenomization.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == bacterial colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia following tracheostomy and long-term intubation in pediatric patients.
AB  == serial tracheal cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from 27 pediatric patients during one year of follow-up. the patients had required tracheostomy and prolonged intubation for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months (average, 7 1/2 months). cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. the most frequent aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides fragilis. replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia. the data suggest that anaerobic bacteria are a part of the bacterial flora in colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia in  patients with tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.

TI  == survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  == the survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. these diluents  could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. a total of 84 episodes of  septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. the more frequently isolated  organisms were: staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); escherichia coli (18%); klebsiella (7.1%); pseudomonas (6%); and bacteroides fragilis (6%). other isolates included  proteus, serratia, acinetobacter, hemolytic streptococcus, and bacillus cereus. in 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. the fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.

TI  == identification of bacteroides fragilis by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  == rabbit antiserum against live or heat-killed bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 bacteria was titrated against hot phenol water-extracted polysaccharide antigens  from five different species of the 'b. fragilis group' of bacteria using an enzyme immunoassay and shown to be specific for the b. fragilis nctc 9343 polysaccharide. when the antiserum was used in indirect immunofluorescence, 97.1% of 244 b. fragilis strains were correctly identified. only 8 of the other 312 bacteroides strains were stained by the anti-b fragilis serum. the 'cross-reactive' bacteriodes strains all belonged to the "b. fragilis group" of bacteria (i.e., b; distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and  b. vulgatus). none of the 425 aerobic enteric bacteria representing salmonella, e. coli, proteus, yersinia, shigella, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and  pseudomonas were positive using the anti-b. fragilis serum. likewise, all the 59  gram-positive strains representing streptococcus, bacillus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, propionibacterium, lactobacillus, eubacterium, and clostridium did not stain. our data shows in accordance with other findings [11], that b. fragilis strains possess a species-specific cell envelope antigen(s) which promises to be important for production of antisera, making a rapid identification of the species possible.

TI  == genetic determinants of microbial resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == emergence of antibiotic resistance is related to the ease of mutation, to the extent of exchange of genetic information in bacteria by conjugation, transformation, and transduction, and to the large-scale use of antimicrobial agents in the biosphere. in addition to the development of resistance through chromosomal mutation and exchange of chromosomal genes among organisms, there is  a more profound enlargement of the gene pool by the dissemination and amplification of plasmids. two examples of the exchange of antibiotic resistance  are analyzed: the transfer of plasmids from bacteroides fragilis to escherichia coli and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance in b. fragilis were transferred to e. coli by dna-mediated transformation and conjugation. the beta-lactamase in the transformants and transconjugants displayed the same substrate specificity and electrophoretic mobility as the donor strain. the plasmid apparently was integrated rapidly into the chromosome of the recipient strain. multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae were analyzed for  plasmids, and none were detected. furthermore, no evidence of linkage between the traits of multiple antibiotic resistance was observed. beta-lactamase was not detected in the penicillin-resistant strains; therefore, it is likely that the resistance in these strains was chromosomal rather than plasmid-mediated. the range of genetic exchange and the use of koch's postulates in determining the genetic mechanism of antibiotic resistance are illustrated and discussed.

TI  == pathogenesis of mucosal injury in the blind loop syndrome.
AB  == bacterial extracts were prepared from cultures originating in chronic self-filling intestinal blind loops in rats. their ability to remove active maltase molecules from isolated brush border membranes was studied in vitro. twelve strains in 51 tested, belonging to one of three species, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and streptococcus fecalis, possessed maltase-releasing activity. the ability to remove maltase correlated well with the ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-l-alaninate (nba), an ester substrate rapidly hydrolyzed by elastase, but not with substrated favored by tryhsin and chymotrypsin. maltase-releasing activity from c. perfringens was strongly inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor and to a lesser extent by lima bean trypsin inhibitor. of four chloromethylketone active-site directed inhibitors tested with specificities for elastase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, inhibition was maximal with elastase-specific inhibitors. in two species, activity was shown to be heat sensitive, and to be inhibited by concentration of the extract. in one species maltase-releasing activity was shown to be due to an enzyme of molecular weight at least 66,000 with the capacity to remove lactase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as maltase. the results indicate that anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic species, previously identified with the pathology of of the blind loop syndrome, contain proteases which are capable of removing components of the intestinal surface membrane. these proteases appear to have elastase-like substrate specificity and may be involved in the etiology of disaccharidase deficiency in bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic piperazine penicillin  derivative, was evaluated against 626 clinical isolates and compared with the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml, piperacillin inhibited all streptococci except enterococci. non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were inhibited by 1.6 microgram or less per ml. both beta-lactamase- and non-beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus were inhibited by 0.1 microgram/ml. piperacillin inhibited non-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, salmonella, and shigella at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, but 20% of strains of these species containing type iii beta-lactamase were not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml. piperacillin at 25 micrograms/ml, inhibited 83% of citrobacter, 58% of klebsiella, 88% of enterobacter, and 50% of indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, and providencia. at 25 micrograms/ml, piperacillin inhibited 95% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 78% of bacteroides fragilis. the minimal inhibitory concentration of piperacillin against pseudomonas was affected by increasing the  inoculum size and by ph. minimum bactericidal concentrations against pseudomonas  and serratia often were eightfold greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations. piperacillin was equal in activity to ampicillin against enterococci. it was more active than carbenicillin against e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and bacteroides. it was the most active penicillin against pseudomonas and inhibited many strains of pseudomonas for which the mics of carbenicillin were above 200 micrograms/ml. piperacillin was hydrolyzed by many different beta-lactamases. synergistic activity of piperacillin was demonstrated  when it was combined with amikacin, gentamicin, and cefazolin against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. no antagonism was observed when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides; however, antagonism was observed  rarely against e. coli when piperacillin was combined with cefazolin.

TI  == the capsular polysaccharide of bacteroides fragilis as a virulence factor: comparison of the pathogenic potential of encapsulated and unencapsulated strains.
AB  == the pathogenic potentials of encapsulated and unencapsulated strains of bacteroides fragilis were compared by use of a rat model of intraabdominal sepsis. implantation of encapsulated b. fragilis alone resulted in abscesses in most recipients, whereas unencapsulated strains seldom produced this effect unless they were combined with another organism. implants of heat-killed, encapsulated b. fragilis also resulted in abscess formation. subsequent experiments suggested that the abscess-potentiating ability of encapsulated b. fragilis is related to the capsular polysaccharide. implantation of 200 microgram of the purified capsular material alone or in conjuction with unencapsulated strains caused abscess formation in a majority of animals. comparable results were not obtained with capsular polysaccharide from escherichia coli o7:k1(l)"nm  or with heat-killed streptococcus pneumoniae type iii. the capsular polysaccharide of b. fragilis appears to potentiate abscess formation and may represent a virulence factor for this species.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology in head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  == a prospective study of wound infections following major head and neck cancer surgery was undertaken to define a rational approach to trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and initial therapy of these infections. preoperative aerobic cultures were taken from the planned site of skin incision and from the oropharynx. both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from all wound infections. patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics were excluded from the study. the data indicate that preoperative cultures are not usually predictive of the bacteriology of subsequent wound infection. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were cultured from most wound infections, and usually reflected normal anaerobic  oropharyngeal flora, exogenously acquired staphylococcus aureus, or both. bacteroides fragilis was not cultured in this series. antibiotics selected for trials of prophylaxis or initial treatment of these infections should cover both  the resident oral aerobic and anaerobic flora and s aureus. coverage for b fragilis does not appear necessary. antibiotic choices might include penicillin g plus a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a parenteral cephalosporin.

AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == effect of dilution on recovery of bacteria from blood.
AB  == the multiplication rate of bacteria in undiluted blood containing sodium polyanethol sulfonate was compared with growth rates obtained in dilutions of blood ranging from 1:2 to 1:8. although all organisms tested grew in the undiluted blood, increased growth rates were seen in the 1:2 dilution. further dilution resulted in growth rates equivalent to that obtained with the 1:2 dilution. in view of these results, we question the present recommendations that  blood be diluted 1:10 or 1:20.

TI  == therapy for experimental intraabdominal sepsis: comparison of four cephalosporins with clindamycin plus gentamicin.
AB  == an experimental model of intraabdominal sepsis in rats was used for evaluation of treatment with four cephalosporins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole. doses were 115 mg of each of the cephalosporins/kg and, in additional experiments, 350 mg of cephalothin or cefazolin/kg. response to treatment was evaluated by mortality rate and the incidence of intraabdominal abscess. all four cephalosporins and gentamicin produced a similar reduction in mortality rates. there was a marked variation in incidence of abscess dependent upon the cephalosporin selected and the dosage tested. regimens most effective in reducing abscesses were clindamycin, low-dose cefoxitin, or high-dose cephalothin.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  == inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the who-ics agar dilution technique. cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, haemophilus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. none of these cephalosporins was active against enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteeae, pseudomonas, or  bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == neonatal sepsis at the johns hopkins hospital, 1969-1975: bacterial isolates and  clinical correlates.
AB  == the experience with neonatal sepsis at the johns hopkins hospital during 1969-1975 was reviewed. major pathogens included escherichia coli, group b streptococcus, other streptococci, and klebsiella. nineteen percent of coliform isolates were kanamycin-resistant. the frequency of recovery of e. coli was increased in early-onset sepsis, and the frequency of recovery of klebsiella was  increased in late-onset sepsis. the mortality rate was 23%. the frequency of recovery of e. coli was increased in fatal cases, and mortality was highly correlated with the presence of gastrointestinal catastrophe. ampicillin and gentamicin are the initial antibiotics of choice for neonatal sepsis at this institution; a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be added when staphylococcus aureus involvement is likely, and addition of chloramphenicol or clindamycin should be considered for infants at increased risk for bacteroides fragilis sepsis.

TI  == numbers and types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens since 1960.
AB  == between 1960 and 1974, 826 specimens, excluding stool, urine, sputum, and blood,  yielded 689 (83%) positive cultures, of which 403 (58.5%) contained anaerobic bacteria. this represents 48.8% of the total specimens cultured. isolates from 153 specimens obtained and stocked from 1965 to 1974 were reidentified by current criteria. gram-negative bacilli, primarily bacteroides, were the most frequently  isolated anaerobes, being found in 70% of 153 anaerobe-positive specimens and accounting for 42% of the total anaerobes isolated. gram-positive cocci were second in occurrence, being found in 66% of 153 specimens and accounting for 40%  of the total isolates. bacteroides fragilis was by far the most frequently isolated species. compairson of 14 years of cumulative data with data from current studies covering 1- to 2-year periods indicated that the anaerobes isolated from clinical material have not changed significantly in type or relative numbers.

TI  == quantitative microflora of the vagina.
AB  == this study enumerated the predominant vaginal flora in 25 healthy patients: 18 prenatal (six with and 12 without gonorrhea) and seven nonpregnant without gonorrhea. all 25 patients had aerobes and 19 of the 25 had anerobes isolated in  titers of greater than or equal to 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu per milliliter). the most frequently isolated microorganism was the lactobacillus (aerobic and anaerobic species) followed by c. vaginale, viridans streptococci, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bifidobacterium sp. bacteroides fragilis was not isolated. there were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation of any specific microorganism or bacterial counts between pregnant and nonpregnant women or between pregnant women with and without gonorrhea (p greater than 0.05), except pregnant patients had significantly higher total facultative counts associated with significantly lower anaerobic lactobacilli counts and higher c. vaginale counts (p less than 0.01) than in nonpregnant patients.

TI  == bactericidal activity of tinidazole. an in vitro comparison of the effects of tinidazole and metronidazole against bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the new antiprotozoal agent, tinidazole, was found to be bactericidal against all 52 isolates of obligate anaerobic bacteria tested, 42 bacteroides fragilis, 4 clostridia and 6 peptostreptococci. the minimum bactericidal concentrations of tinidazole for b. fragilis ranged from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml, and those of metronidazole from 0.25 to 8 mug/ml, i.e. several times lower than the serum concentrations achievable after oral administration. in most cases the mic was identical with mbc or half of it. on the average, tinidazole was slightly more effective against b. fragilis than metronidazole. although essentially the activities of the two drugs were positively correlated, there was a fourfold difference in their mbc for 10 of the 42 b. fragilis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic flora of the cervix during pregnancy and the puerperium.
AB  == comparison of species of bacteria isolated from patients with endometritis with species isolated from normal pregnant and nonpregnant women suggests that bacteria causing infections are indigenous to the genital tract. however, complete studies of the flora of pregnant women, especially anaerobic flora, are  lacking. aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the endocervix were obtained from women in all trimesters of pregnancy and at three days and six weeks post partum. the incidence of occurrence of each species of bacteria and the average number of different species per culture were determined for each period. the most prevalent organisms in each period were aerobic gram-positive rods and cocci and anaerobic  gram-positive cocci. the average number of species of aerobic bacteria per culture remained approximately the same in each culture period. the average number of anaerobic species per culture decreased as pregnancy progressed, peaked on the third postpartum day, and at six weeks post partum returned to a level similar to that of the first trimester.

AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.

AB  == a bacteriological study of 110 emergency appendicectomies is reported. in two-thirds of these the appendix was inflamed or gangrenous, and in 45 cases positive cultures were obtained from swabs taken at operation. bacteroides were found frequently in these swabs and also in those taken from wound infections. although this study is too small to draw any definite conclusions, it is felt that bacteroides should be considered an important pathogen in appendicitis and should be taken into account in the few ill patients where antibiotic treatment is contemplated. it was also noted that swabs taken from the surface of the appendix itself were more often positive than those from the peritoneal cavity, and this difference apperars to be significant.

TI  == in vitro activity of josamycin against aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.

TI  == activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of cefamandole was comparable to that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephaloridine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae. in contrast, cefamandole was considerably more active than cephalothin, cefazolin, or cephaloridine against gram-negative facultative bacilli, including haemophilus influenzae, the most striking disparities being noted with indole-positive proteus and enterobacter. bacteroides fragilis was more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefamandole or cefazolin (median minimal inhibitory concentration, approximately 8, 32, and 32 mug/ml, respectively); cephalothin exhibited still less activity against this species. the majority of other anaerobes were inhibited by relatively low concentrations of all four cephalosporins. the results indicate a potentially valuable role for cefamandole  against facultative gram-negative bacilli, including h. influenzae, but no exceptional activity against anaerobes.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoxitin, cefuroxine, and cephaloridine.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial effects of cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin, cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, and cephaloridine were compared. with gram-positive bacteria, marked differences were found only in the effects against streptococcus faecalis, where cephaloridine and cefuroxime were superior to cefoxitin. with gram-negative aerobic bacteria, cefoxitin, which is known to be more resistant to beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria than any cephalosporin, was found to be more effective than cefuroxime and cephaloridine against ampicillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli and indole-positive strains of proteus. haemophilus influenzae was found to be more susceptible to cefuroxime than to cefoxitin and cephaloridine. when ampicillin-resistant strains of h. influenzae were tested, markedly higher minimal inhibitory concentration values were obtained with cephaloridine in comparison to those obtained with ampicillin-susceptible strains. these increases in the minimal inhibitory concentration values were not observed with cefoxitin and cefuroxime, probably due to the resistance of these two compounds to beta-lactamases. strains of bacteroides fragilis were found to be much more susceptible to cefoxitin than to  cefuroxime, which in turn was superior to cephaloridine. the results obtained indicate that cefoxitin and cefuroxime both are superior in their antibacterial spectra to the cephalosporins that are now in clinical use.

TI  == factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
AB  == antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of bacteroides fragilis. comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of e. coli or b. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable b. fragilis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus albus, neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. the presence of dense cultures of b. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. other factors inhibiting conjugation  to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of b. fragilis in vivo. as well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of r factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.

AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.

AB  == germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant shigella flexneri strain. antagonism against shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with bacteroides fragilis. a moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either streptococcus faecalis or bifidobacterium adolescentis. shigella persisted in the cecal contents of e. coli-associated mice at very low,  stable levels. shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with e. coli and bacteroides. upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. the e. coli population was greatly reduced, and shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled e. coli biochemically. a streptomycin-resistant e. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. shigella concomitantly declined to levels below  detection.

TI  == effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  == in the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. of the species tested, bacteroides oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. streptococcus mutans, clostridium difficile, a neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. a group k streptococcus and b. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. a peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. when this strain was combined with two clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. this polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. no net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
