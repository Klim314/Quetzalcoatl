TI  == bacterial dynamics during yearlong spontaneous fermentation for production of ngari, a dry fermented fish product of northeast india.
AB  == ngari is the most popular traditionally processed non-salted fish product, prepared from sun-dried small cyprinid fish puntius sophore (ham.) in manipur state of northeast india. the microbial involvement in ngari production remained  uncertain due to its low moisture content and yearlong incubation in anaerobically sealed earthen pots without any significant change in total microbial count. the culture-independent pcr-dgge analysis used during this study confirmed a drastic bacterial community structural change in comparison to its raw material. to understand the bacterial dynamics during this dry fermentation,  time series samples collected over a period of nine months through destructive sampling from two indigenous ngari production centres were analysed by using both culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods. a total of 210 bacteria isolated from the samples were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) based grouping and 16s rrna gene sequence similarity analysis. the dominant bacteria were staphylococcus cohnii subsp. cohnii (38.0%), tetragenococcus halophilus subsp. flandriensis (16.8%), a novel phylotype related to lactobacillus pobuzihii (7.2%), enterococcus faecium (7.2%), bacillus indicus  (6.3%) and staphylococcus carnosus (3.8%). distinct bacterial dynamics with the emergence of t. halophilus at third month (10(6)cfu/g), l. pobuzihii at sixth month (10(6)cfu/g), s. carnosus at three to six months (10(4)cfu/g) and b. indicus at six to nine months (10(5)cfu/g) in both the production centres was observed during ngari fermentation. however, the other two dominant bacteria s. cohnii and e. faecium were isolated throughout the fermentation with the population of 10(6)cfu/g and 10(4)cfu/g respectively. culture-independent pcr-dgge analysis further showed the presence of additional species, in which kocuria halotolerans and macrococcus caseolyticus disappeared during fermentation while clostridium irregulare and azorhizobium caulinodans were detected throughout the fermentation. principal component analysis showed a drastic bacterial community structural change at the sixth month of fermentation. these identified dominant bacterial cultures of t. halophilus, l. pobuzihii, s. carnosus and b. indicus could be effectively utilised for designing starter culture and optimizing fermentation technology for industrialisation of ngari production.

TI  == study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
